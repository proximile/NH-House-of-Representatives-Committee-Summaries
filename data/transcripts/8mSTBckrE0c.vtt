no

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
my name is david a waltz i represent
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1540
 
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
i was asked to put it in it's not my
 
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.789 align:start position:0%
i was asked to put it in it's not my
bill

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
bill
but

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i suspect
 
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.950 align:start position:0%
so i suspect
that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
the people following me will explain the
 
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
it allows for
 
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.110 align:start position:0%
it allows for
actually

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
calls for recording
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
interrogations in the police station
 
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
they're arrested
 
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
they record the interrogation
 
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
never having been arrested before i
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
suspect it might be a good thing
 
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i'll let the people behind me
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%

and we have
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
sought to address those concerns
 
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.509 align:start position:0%
sought to address those concerns
by

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
by

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative welch

write the amendment so i'll address the
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
changes to the amendment
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
i don't have the line by line but in the
 
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.149 align:start position:0%
i don't have the line by line but in the
definition

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
no still don't have it um i
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
we added the language associated
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
with an arrest
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh or detention
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and in the definition of law
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer we added uh in line
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the concerns expressed by
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
the representative from the department
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
of corrections uh lynn cusack uh
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
a probation officer a parole officer or
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
a corrections officer
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
or a security officer employed by the
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
educational institution who has the
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
power to detain an individual
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
i believe representative abbas felt the
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
definition of the security officer
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
employed by an educational institution
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
was to bra broad so he added the
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
who has the power to detain an
 
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.430 align:start position:0%
who has the power to detain an
individual

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
and uh attorney cusack had concerns
 
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.590 align:start position:0%
and uh attorney cusack had concerns
about

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity and lack of clarity
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
relating to probation officers pearl
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
officers and corrections officers so we
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
added that language in there too
 
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.390 align:start position:0%
added that language in there too
and

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
if you combine that language with the
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
added language in custodial
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
interrogation that is associated with an
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
arrest or detention it does not include
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
corrections officers who are just
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
engaging in uh investigation for
 
00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.749 align:start position:0%
engaging in uh investigation for
possible

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
internal disciplinary proceedings which
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
attorney cusack had
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
we've added the language again
 
00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.070 align:start position:0%
we've added the language again
to

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
account for the concerns of attorney
 
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
account for the concerns of attorney
cusack

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
cusack
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
likewise the provisions of 494 a3 shall
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
not apply to administrative disciplinary
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearings in a state correctional
 
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
hearings in a state correctional
facility

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
or for parole violators not charged with
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
a new offense so i think those address
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns that attorney cusack raised
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is there is an
 
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is there is an
exchange

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.189 align:start position:0%
exchange
between

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
attorney cusack
 
00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
attorney cusack
and

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
susan pachell
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
who has been working with the national
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
innocence project uh the new england
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
instance project and myself on this and
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
she approved of these um
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is she approved of
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
and finally uh in 594 a
 
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.790 align:start position:0%
and finally uh in 594 a
five

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
there was concern expressed by several
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee about somebody
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
who didn't want a suspect who was about
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
to be questioned who didn't want to be
 
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0%
to be questioned who didn't want to be
recorded

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
recorded
and

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
and
we

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
added an exception for somebody who
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be recorded so the police
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
would not
be

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.629 align:start position:0%
be
violating

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
violating
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
these provisions if the person asked not
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be recorded and and uh uh
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
wrote you know and and that was captured
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
in a written document um
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
the final thing i would address for the
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
committee i know i've heard some
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
concern expressed about this possibly
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
being an unfunded mandate
 
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
being an unfunded mandate
um

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh as a as any law professor should i
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
have at least two answers for that
 
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.830 align:start position:0%
have at least two answers for that
question

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh number one is uh
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's probably not a uh police
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
department even the smallest of police
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
departments whose mem who has at least
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have at least one member who has
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh an iphone or a smartphone of some
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
sort so they are that they're not gonna
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
go out and buy massive amounts of
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
cameras number one number two and more
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
importantly this provision allows for
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the definition of
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
electronic recording which is required
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
it says an audio recording or an audio
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
and video recording so it doesn't need
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
to be a video recording you know
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
my personal preference is that's better
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
but uh there's a little give in this
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
every police department already has
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
equipment to tape uh these uh
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
make audio tapes of this and
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
as we heard from for example uh paul
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
halverson the merrimack county attorney
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
his belief is virtually all the police
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
departments in his jurisdiction already
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's my explanation of the uh
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
amendment uh more than willing to answer
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i have a question um
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
regarding what we just you just
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
discussed the unfunded mandate portion
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
of it um
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
given assuming arguendo that everybody
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
has some type of a way to to record
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
i'm more concerned with the the storage
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
and retention
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and um
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
the possible costs that could
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
put on to a police department in the
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
manpower as far as you know
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
managing this because it could be quite
 
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.829 align:start position:0%
managing this because it could be quite
voluminous

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
voluminous
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
and so could you speak to that yes um
 
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.630 align:start position:0%
and so could you speak to that yes um
uh

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
most police departments that i'm aware
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
of already have storage capability
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
number one hard you know
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
a server or the appropriate uh hardware
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's not police
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
departments don't obtain that many
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
confessions that would fall under this
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh number one number two
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
because of that most police departments
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
have already solved the storage problem
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh number three if they do an audio
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
recording you know that storage issue is
 
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
recording you know that storage issue is
just

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh is a lot simpler
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
and uh cloud storage is uh
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a mechanism that is
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
far far cheaper um and my guess is
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
virtually every police department
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh maybe short of you know a one officer
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
department has a cloud storage
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
capability uh that uh at least i think
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
of of at least my belief with you know
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
my iphone
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
i don't pay any extra for the cloud
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
storage uh up to a certain limit
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and for just to follow up if
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
cloud storage from a from a privacy
 
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
cloud storage from a from a privacy
perspective

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
guarantee that a person's information
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
from an interrogation
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
is protected
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is every police
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
department this comes from my recent
 
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
department this comes from my recent
experience

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the portsmouth police commission
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
where i had to take a
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
loosely called a security test before i
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
could have access to data
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
virtually every police department that
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of has procedures in place now
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
given uh a lot a lot that is occurring
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
virtually rather than uh in hard copy
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
they already have uh privacy uh
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
confidentiality regulations in place so
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
that not just anybody can access it you
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
know they they try to make it
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that in the end everything
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
is hackable
 
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.590 align:start position:0%
is hackable
um

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh they they do what they have to do
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
what they can in order
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
have access to
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
for example fbi data so that's imposed
 
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.949 align:start position:0%
for example fbi data so that's imposed
uh

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
by the requirements of fbi security
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's it's a problem it's a
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern but i think it's a
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
problem most
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
good representative testament thank you
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
is there any issue with
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
this interrogation or this interview
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
being challenged
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and not standing up to all of
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
the rigors of
 
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.670 align:start position:0%
the rigors of
of

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
either confidentiality or was this at
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
the right time right place
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
is it tagged is it is it a
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
a valid
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
copy of something i mean
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of issues are we getting into
 
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.069 align:start position:0%
what kind of issues are we getting into
um

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
minimal issues actually because most the
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
police departments already pay attention
 
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.030 align:start position:0%
police departments already pay attention
to

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
what they need to do
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
to the technical legal term is
 
00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:03.509 align:start position:0%
to the technical legal term is
authenticate

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
authenticate
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
the copy of the confession
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
in order to get it admitted into court
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
they do that with a written confession
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
or if they they already
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
authentication requirements which is
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
really a
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
fancy word for
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
is what you're showing me in court what
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
you just testified to
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
so that's procedure that they already
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
i just one more question occurred to me
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to the record
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
retention requirements for a recording
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm also thinking not only of
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
confessions but of possible exculpatory
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
evidence that may be available to a
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
defense attorney in one of these
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
recordings um how could we ensure that
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
that i want to understand how that has
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be held and recorded and turned over
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
during discovery well uh it has to be
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.949 align:start position:0%
during discovery well uh it has to be
held

00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
held
 
00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
held
and

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
they have to turn over excludatory
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
evidence whether it's in the recorded
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
confession or in some other way
 
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.670 align:start position:0%
confession or in some other way
and

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
i am not other than police departments
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
who for one reason or another screwed up
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
every police department i know holds on
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
to evidence in a case until the case is
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
completely over
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of some evidence uh as this
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee saw last year in the the
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
amendments to the post-conviction dna
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
statute that this committee passed and
 
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.710 align:start position:0%
statute that this committee passed and
got

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh made its way all through and was
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor there are
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of evidence there
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of evidence there
are

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that the evidence in a case
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
be held for
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
a particular length of time
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
even after the conviction is resolved
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
in case there is for example
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
biological evidence that has
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
not been tested in the case itself
 
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.150 align:start position:0%
not been tested in the case itself
and

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
the individual asserts their innocence
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
after the conviction
 
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
after the conviction
and

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are already provisions in place in
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
that post-conviction dna statute for
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative representative panalacas
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just i wanted to
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
know if the amendment
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
replaces the whole bill
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
additions to i think they're all
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
additions to the the original 15 hv 1540
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it replaces anything but
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
it adds language that
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
tends to the concerns
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr j thanks for taking my
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
question does the bill have a provision
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
to provide a copy of the interrogation
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
to the detainee
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh not the detainee
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
right after it's taken
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
but but if uh
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
it it has it will have to be provided as
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
a part of discovering uh the natural
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
process of discovery
 
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
process of discovery
follow-up

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
in the interest of preserving the actual
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
data wouldn't it make sense to have a
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
copy made at that point of time to
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's not
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
theoretically yes
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a balance between how difficult it
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
is in the moment after the confession is
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
taken with somebody who may well be
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
sitting in jail and getting them an
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
audio or
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
audio and vid video copy of it
 
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:06.309 align:start position:0%
audio and vid video copy of it
uh

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh what might become of that in that
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
person's hands and you balance that
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
against the interest in
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
making sure the person has a copy of the
 
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.909 align:start position:0%
making sure the person has a copy of the
original

00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
to go back to an earlier question i
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
think that's what the
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
authentication process is about
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.430 align:start position:0%
authentication process is about
um

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
it will the confession will always be
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the copy of the confession audio or
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
audio and video will always be provided
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
to the defense attorney in the case
 
00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
to the defense attorney in the case
and

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
they will have the opportunity
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know if they show it to their client
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
or have a client listen to it and the
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
client said i never said that you know
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's not me on there or you know they
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
left something out there um
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
if they can make an argument that that's
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
a problem then it will fail to be
 
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.710 align:start position:0%
a problem then it will fail to be
authenticated

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
authenticated
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
um so there's a process in place so
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know in theory yeah it'd be great to
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
give the person a copy but um
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
you balance that with what uh to use the
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
formal legal term what a pain in the
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
neck it would be
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
to get a copy to the suspect right after
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
the interrogation
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
um uh i think
 
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
um uh i think
it's

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
at least okay
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
to wait until
 
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.190 align:start position:0%
to wait until
the

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
the suspect's attorney gets a copy
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm similan
 
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
i'm similan
hi

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
how are you good how are you
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
so you know what uh mr professor um as
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
you as you know that the the air the law
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
in this area on custodial interrogation
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
has has been pretty well developed
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionally by case law
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i guess sometimes
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
about the definition of custodial
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
interrogation in that
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
it it at least is susceptible to a
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
construction that would go beyond
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
what what i think we
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally think of as custodial
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
interrogation so my question is this
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
what if we change the definition to read
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
as follows
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation means express
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
questioning while under arrest or other
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
actions or words by a law enforcement
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
officer which are reasonably likely to
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
elicit an incriminating response from an
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual and which occurs
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
when a reasonable individual in the same
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances would consider himself or
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
herself under arrest or the functional
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent of arrest
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative lynn what you're asking
 
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
representative lynn what you're asking
about

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the problem with just saying associated
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
with arrest is
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's any number as i i know you know
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's any number of uh
 
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
there's any number of uh
circumstances

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
in which somebody is in custody but
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been arrested
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the term arrest is a fourth
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
amendment term it rises out of the
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment and it's defined by
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
that body of fourth amendment case law
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
whereas the term custody is a fifth
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment term
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
created essentially for the purpose of
 
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.270 align:start position:0%
created essentially for the purpose of
uh

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
implementation of the miranda warnings
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
so to just say arrest it then it that
 
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.029 align:start position:0%
so to just say arrest it then it that
it

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
what i would say that the correct way to
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
say it means expressed questioning
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
associated with custody
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
well but isn't that may it follow
 
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.870 align:start position:0%
well but isn't that may it follow
follow-up

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
but it's i mean the thing i'm concerned
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
about particularly with your reference
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the word detention is
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
i mean when a police officer pulls
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
somebody over makes a traffic stop the
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
person is detained they can't agree they
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't leave but that's not custody
 
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.669 align:start position:0%
can't leave but that's not custody
but

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
well i guess but but you talk about
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
detention here and that's so that's i
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
guess that's part of as i understand the
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
law it's you either have to be formally
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
under arrest
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
or you have to be in the situation of
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
the functional equivalent of arrest yes
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
um now uh i i just if we're yeah i agree
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
with you on the issue of detention you
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
know this language was initially put in
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
here to
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
distinguish those
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances when a corrections officer
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
or a parole officer
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
is doing interrogation
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay attention as good
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
attention as we should have to this
 
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.310 align:start position:0%
attention as we should have to this
issue

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to just put that
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
definition in there that is associated
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
with a formal arrest you know the
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
definition of of custody a formal arrest
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
or a restraint on on freedom uh uh
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh equivalent to that of a form of an
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
arrest okay yeah i'm fine with putting
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
that language in there uh i think it it
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
it cures the problem
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
i um the committee appreciates that um
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
the committee is all welcome to come to
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
my class on friday which we'll talk
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
about i am um from uh from a different
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
perspective um
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
from my um remembrance of my days in the
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
police academy
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better instead of saying
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
would consider themselves in custody
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
would where a reasonable person would
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
consider themselves not free to leave
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
consider themselves not free to leave
no

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
your microphone
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh representative lin will
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
back me up on this but
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
not free to leave
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
is the definition of detention
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
not free to leave does not mean you are
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
in custody it has to be a restraint
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
on freedom that is the functional
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
equivalent of an arrest whether they've
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
been told they're under arrest or not so
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
not free to leave would bring us back to
 
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
not free to leave would bring us back to
the

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
detention under the law does not count
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
as custody and not free to leave is the
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
test if somebody's detained
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
i was listening to your your testimony
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if i heard you clearly
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
but i thought i heard you say audio or
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
video in one of your sentences yes
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay could i could i just follow up then
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
in line 23
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the amendment when it says by audio
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
and video
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
are we talking the same thing um if you
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
read the beginning of that it says means
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
an audio recording or audio and video
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
so you can do an audio recording but if
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
you do a video recording there's got to
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions again
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
sincerely thank you for your testimony
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you oh hold on stand by oh i
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
phrase this but we're now in to the
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
video age where
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
requiring officers to wear
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
body cams and when they're
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with people
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
but you
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
are saying that somebody can say i don't
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
want to be recorded and has to put in
 
00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.950 align:start position:0%
want to be recorded and has to put in
writing

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
so what happens to the uh
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
not all police departments have body
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
games yet
 
00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
games yet
certainly

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
for example portsmouth doesn't in spite
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
of some people's best efforts
 
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
of some people's best efforts
um

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
if they would have to turn off the body
 
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
if they would have to turn off the body
cam

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
cam
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
during a recording
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
of a confession
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
during a confession
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
if the individual who would be recorded
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to be recorded under the
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
provisions of this
 
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
provisions of this
amendment

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
so they would have to turn the body cam
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
off and all the body cam regulations and
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
policies i've seen
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh allow for a request
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
within certain limits to not have a uh
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the police recorded
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
and this certainly this circumstance
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
so i could
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
also say playing devil's advocate so if
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's actually my job well i'm going to
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
try it so basically
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
anybody that
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
reads this law could go to the last line
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
and say
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
when they're being
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
interviewed or interrogated
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be recorded and so be
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
useless for the police departments to
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
have video and audio of everybody that's
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
being interviewed or
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
decides to invoke that
 
00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:45.269 align:start position:0%
decides to invoke that
requirement

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes it would be but um i have to say you
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
know god knows i don't have any data on
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
i would be stunned if that was everybody
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
chose not to be recorded the huge
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
majority of suspects
 
00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.149 align:start position:0%
majority of suspects
are

00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
would want the recording because they
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
tend to be in the first instance very
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
suspicious of the police and they would
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
see this as more of a protection
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
than as something that would cause them
 
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.710 align:start position:0%
than as something that would cause them
trouble

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
there will be exceptions and that's fine
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding it from talking with
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
the uh national innocence project is
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
that there has uh that that has not
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
happened in jurisdictions i think
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's 26 states now that have some
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
version of this provision
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
they have uh that has not been what has
 
00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
they have uh that has not been what has
happened

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.630 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
uh

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the just one other question on the in
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
the air on the in the section of the
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill that establishes the exclusionary
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
rule there's there's a provision if i if
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
i recall correctly that says if you
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't record
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
if you interrogate and you don't record
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
then on a second round of interrogation
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
you do record that that you it's the
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule still applies and this
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
is whether it's a sort of
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
cat out of the bag and i understand that
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
my question is this
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
should there be some language in that
 
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.590 align:start position:0%
should there be some language in that
section

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
section
that

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
limits it
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the same subject matter in other
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
words what i'm thinking about is suppose
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
the police
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know they arrest somebody
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
they interrogate the person and they
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't record it
 
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
don't record it
and

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
then subsequent to that they get some
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
information about a new crime another
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
crime that they had not asked about and
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you know for example maybe they
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
interrogate somebody on
 
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.549 align:start position:0%
interrogate somebody on
some

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
drug offense or a minor theft or
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
something like that and then they get
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
some evidence that the person let's say
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
was involved in a homicide
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
now they want to you know now they
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
with a recording they
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
interrogate him on the homicide would
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
would that be precluded
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
from admissibility under your
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
under the way the bill's drafted now and
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
if so should the should there be some
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
language that says it shouldn't be
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
well if they didn't record the as i
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
understand sequence
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
interrogation on the drug offense no
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
recording interrogation on the homicide
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
recording right
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
um the homicide recording will be
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
admissible under this the the drug
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
offense uh will not be admissible
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh in uh
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
because they didn't follow this law and
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's and there's unless the the the
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
suspect said
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
i don't want this recorded you know and
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
met the provisions of that exception but
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
short of that
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
the if the the drug interrogation was
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
not recorded it's a violation of the law
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
and there's no real logical reason it
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
should be accepted out of this
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
um you know i i
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
and number two i think part of the gist
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
of your question and i apologize to the
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee because we're
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
going to descend into legal stuff um but
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
um you know that's the oregon versus
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
elstad uh sequence of cases about
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
consecutive confessions
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
um and um so
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh number two
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't um
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
well i'll leave it at that
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
go while the getting is good
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's the right button is i'm
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
cynthia musso i'm a staff attorney at
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
the new england innocence project i
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate you hearing my words today i
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
came primarily to be able to answer
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions but i did want to speak to a
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things that were raised and
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
just sort of to drive home the point
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
about the importance of this bill in
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to know just a
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about me so
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
that i can explain sort of where some of
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
the things i'm going to say are coming
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
from which is that i was a public
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
defender in this state and in
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for almost a decade and
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
before that i actually clerked in the
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
trial courts actually judge lynn was
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
there briefly when i was there
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
as well
um

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to talk about today is the
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
it is virtually something that we've
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
learned as time has moved on is how
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
prevalent uh false confessions can be
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's necessarily
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
intuitive it's not something that
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily sits with everybody you
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
always think to yourself that you would
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
never confess to something that you
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
didn't do but the reality is is that the
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
data that we have from false confession
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
shows us that in almost a third of the
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
confessions with dna exonerations
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a false confession in those
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
cases a third meaning almost one out of
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
three of those cases where dna proves
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have done it there was a
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
confession from somebody that's actually
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
a fairly concerning statistic it's
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
pretty high number and i i was very
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
surprised by that when i joined neep and
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
that was from a public defender who had
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
been in practice for a really long time
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is something that
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost virtually impossible for us
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
to determine whether something is a
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
false confession without having a
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
recording and that's not because the
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
police lie and it's not because our
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
clients lie it's because
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
people just have differing perceptions
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the same event you know they always
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
that classic maxim of there's your side
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
my side and the truth right it's just
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
hard to pull those things apart and the
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
subtleties of interrogation are
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
something that really need to be viewed
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
in person
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's really something that you have to
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
be able to see and hear to understand
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
and to pull apart
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
our experts when we consult with them on
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
these types of cases with false
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
confessions always ask for a recording
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it makes it essentially impossible
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
for them to give an opinion when there
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
isn't a recording in the case the only
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
thing you can tell is the substance of
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
the questions not anything about the
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
particular tone
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
the physical circumstances of the
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
interrogation that sometimes the state
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
of the of the person that's being
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
interrogated you can't tell that from a
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
recording you can't tell um if they're
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
tired if they're hungry if they're worn
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
out if they're
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know laying down on the table all of
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
those things are missing when you don't
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
have a recording it's a pretty common
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
sense bill so common sense that 30 other
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
states already have a recording bill in
 
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
states already have a recording bill in
place

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so it really has a lot of importance
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
for a fairly small
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
ask because the reality is is that so
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
much of new hampshire already does this
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
i know that because i practiced in
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
manchester which is one of the bigger
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and there was never a case
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
where i didn't get a recording from
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
when we had like a confession case um
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
and the practical reality is is that
 
00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:55.269 align:start position:0%
and the practical reality is is that
eliminated

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
litigation around that issue in court
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
because when you have the recording you
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
can you can check that out it it cuts
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
down on on coming to court and arguing
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
about those things
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of i heard a couple of comments
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
sort of like a concern over like the
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
alteration of a recording potentially
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and i know we had a case in
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts around a a recording being
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
altered actually by the police
 
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:23.190 align:start position:0%
altered actually by the police
department

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
and because of the way technology is we
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
were really able to pull that apart but
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the reality was is this was a police
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
department that altered this recording
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't had that recording at all
 
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.790 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't had that recording at all
right

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
we would never even have been able to
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
tell it was altered and the the version
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
of events
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was actually occurred was only
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
gonna ever gonna be what was testified
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
to we would never have been able to pull
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
that apart
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
um there is tech that we can use to try
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
and pull up alterations as well i hear
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
that concern that you raised i think
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's a really valued valid concern but
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
we do have ways of addressing that and i
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
think it is a logistics issue in the end
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
about providing recorded copies of
 
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.550 align:start position:0%
about providing recorded copies of
things

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing i wanted to speak
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we've heard a
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
couple of times is sort of an issue
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
around the consent piece
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i mean i think the state is so
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
careful about uh consent and being
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
recorded right we have this wiretapping
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
statute in the state for a reason and
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions that are built into
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
that uh statute uh some of them are for
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but they still usually
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
require a warrant and so this is still
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
in compliance with that statute and
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that that this
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
statute wouldn't supersede or override
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
that so there would still be a
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
wiretapping issue
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
if we even if that last this piece about
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
the consent piece wasn't there this is
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is these are in compliance with
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
so those are a couple of the issues i
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to address just to highlight a
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
couple of things and if anybody has any
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for your
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
indulgence on me
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
my simple question i'm not 100 sure in
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
my mind are you in favor of the bill or
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
and you may not be able to answer this
 
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
and you may not be able to answer this
but

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
i would assume and i may be incorrect
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
that police standards and training has
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
some type of documentation around
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
standards for recording like this
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
if police are actually already doing it
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
do you know if something like that
 
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.230 align:start position:0%
do you know if something like that
exists

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a requirement at
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
this time i'm not going to say i know
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
specifically uh that the answer to that
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
question i don't think there's a
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
requirement there may be a sort of the
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
suggested best practices but i don't
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
know that there's a requirement there
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
might be i know rep roy mentioned that
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
he would had gone to the academy so
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
maybe he would actually know the answer
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
to that question but i don't know
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
i think there's no requirement although
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
there may be a discussion for best
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
practices that was actually 30 years ago
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
there ain't no further questions thank
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
you oh sorry representative true i
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
didn't see you back there
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question i
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
got a question on uh
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
you said one out of three confessions of
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
false confessions
 
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.310 align:start position:0%
false confessions
how

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
how does the how does the recording
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
prevent that
 
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
prevent that
because

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
if a guy is being if i'm being recorded
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i say yeah i did it
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
but i didn't how does that recording
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
play into it
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good question so i
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
think the reality is is that what these
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
things have shown us over time is when
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
we have recordings we have records
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
and when we create a record we create
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
things that we can learn from so i think
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that there's been a
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
lot of police standards and training
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that have actually changed as you said
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
30 years ago this was how things were
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
and things change over time so what
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
happens is when we have these records
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the uh remedy that we've put into
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
the statue it keeps things out of court
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
so it encourages police to engage in the
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
best practices and it shows the folks
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
that are being under arrest that
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
everything is is going to be recorded
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
and that they're you know they're
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to also be honest
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
about what's going on and i think what
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
ends up happening is we create sort of a
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
data set essentially that says this is
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
how here's the false confessions here's
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the ones we know that are false because
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
of these dna exonerations and here's the
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
practices that we saw that were engaged
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
in during those interrogations and these
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
are practices that we shouldn't engage
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
in anymore that's how we've actually
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
learned over time
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the statistic that i cited the almost
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
one out of three that's how we learned
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
that some of the interrogation tactics
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
that were being used are not effective
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of generating truthful
 
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
in terms of generating truthful
confessions

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
confessions
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
so i think the reality is is that the
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
prevention is in the learning and it's
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the it's in the gathering and it's
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
also in the remedy that we've put in the
 
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.550 align:start position:0%
also in the remedy that we've put in the
statute

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
can i just ask one question they i
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
understand the
the

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
the section which i think makes sense in
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill that says if the
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
person says they don't
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
want to be recorded then then the record
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to occur
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
but i have some question about the the
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
provided the proviso that says provided
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
that this request is is preserved by
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
electronic recording or in a written
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
document because i i guess what i'm
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about is
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
what about the person you know you if
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
you say to somebody somebody says i
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to be recorded and you say ok
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
ok we won't record you then but just
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
sign this or just let me just record
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
this they may very well say
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not doing that either and so that
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
i mean that does seem to me to be a a
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
pretty big a pretty
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
big proviso that could undercut a lot of
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
what you're intending to get at
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
i think the reality is and and that
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
obviously is a concern i think the
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
question in the first instance you know
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
would it is essentially
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
i mean i agree with you i think those
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
are very those those would come hand in
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
hand right you don't want to be recorded
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to sign anything
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
like that would not surprise me that
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
somebody that would say one would say
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
um i think the reality is is that uh
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
that would then be something that would
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
fall under the sort of generalized
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
exception which is like this is what
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
happened and i couldn't do it because
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have we have sort of a
 
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
you know we have we have sort of a
catch-all

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
catch-all
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh provision
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to scramble around to
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh so it's just sort of the overcoming
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
the presumption of inadmissibility so
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that the statements
 
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.190 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that the statements
are

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
admissible under law they're proven by
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence to have
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
been made voluntarily and they have a
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable justification for why they
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
didn't so i think the reality is it
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
would sort of be a catch all there for
 
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
would sort of be a catch all there for
that

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
just follow up thank you
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering would it would an
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable alternative to this be
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of a provision that says
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
that if the person says i don't want to
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
be recorded
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
the police officer conducting the
 
00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
the police officer conducting the
interrogation

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
interrogation
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
has to make
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know has to has to sort of make a
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
note of that and date and time it
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
immediately um and you know so that you
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
have you have at least some record
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's that that is contemporaneous that
 
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.390 align:start position:0%
that's that that is contemporaneous that
the

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
person said i don't want to
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to uh be recorded
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
or i don't want to give a written
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
statement or whatever i don't want to be
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
recorded i guess this
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
i actually think there was when we were
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
originally speaking about this i think
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion that if like in
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
this catch-all for example which is what
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm saying covers it that there would be
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a written
 
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
sort of a written
uh

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know like contemporaneous uh
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
a written contemporaneous
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
recording of that so i i don't i don't
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking
 
00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:10.710 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking
um

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
well i'm gonna ask one last one myself
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
if if this is um if this is the law that
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
they shall be audio be recorded
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it not be the case that every
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
interview would start with the recording
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
on and therefore the the suspect
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying i don't want to be recorded would
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
be captured and at that point it would
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
be terminated
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that's also the theory
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
when you're going to be yeah in a
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
custodial situation i think that's
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
exactly the theory yeah okay all right
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it just be easier if we could
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
educate everybody to shut their mouth
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's not an appropriate question so
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
answer that please
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
um there being no further questions
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
does anybody else
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
the mic
 
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
the mic
okay

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh i drafted uh the change to the
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
language in the definition of custodial
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
interrogation that i talked about with
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i showed it to him
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and he had no problem with that
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative welch is actually taking
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
that down to get that into the amendment
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
i know this is an early bill and needs
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
to be reported out so i just want the
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
chair to know and the committee to know
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%

is better served for having heard this
debate

we are now going to stand in recess
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony again on this
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
rather substantial
 
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.630 align:start position:0%
rather substantial
amendment

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
we started out looking at
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
the presumptions under the asset
 
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
the presumptions under the asset
forfeiture

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
section of
 
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
section of
318b

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
318b
 
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.829 align:start position:0%
318b
and

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
using his great skills as a
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer decided that the process was uh
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
um divided so
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
let me describe the process as it works
 
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
let me describe the process as it works
now

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing with this amendment
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.309 align:start position:0%
just uh
broadly

00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
00:50:40.319 --> 00:50:41.670 align:start position:0%
broadly
currently

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
after 2016 we instituted the policy of
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
criminal asset forfeiture replacing
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
civil asset forfeiture for in-state
 
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.950 align:start position:0%
civil asset forfeiture for in-state
process

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
and when we did that we
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
and judiciary has worked on this for
 
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.190 align:start position:0%
and judiciary has worked on this for
years

00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
we set it up with
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
um two tracks a criminal process for the
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
criminal charge
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
if there is one
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
putting aside the civil
 
00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:12.790 align:start position:0%
putting aside the civil
uh

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
prosecution against the asset that might
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
be connected to
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
be connected to
the

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
the crime if if there is one
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
so there were basically two tracks the
 
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
so there were basically two tracks the
civil

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
civil
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
forfeiture side was set to the side
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
while the criminal process went on
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
after the
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
criminal process was settled then the
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
state could do move to the
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
forfeiture side
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the process and that would be
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
a civil process
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
and what we were looking at previously
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the evidence standard
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
which we would be applied whether it's
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence or
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you beyond reasonable doubt okay
 
00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you beyond reasonable doubt okay
so

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have the um
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
those two processes and this amendment
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
brings them together
 
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
brings them together
and

00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page two
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
section e is new
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
and this
uh

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
has been added to protect um
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
small um seizures
 
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
small um seizures
um

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
200 cash um you know anyone going to get
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
a bag of groceries these days that uses
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
cash is going to have 200 with them
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh in vehicles um
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
a two thousand dollar car is not exactly
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
the drug dealer's uh
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
choice well they they might and they
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't care but someone that is
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
of less means that's their way of
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
getting to work or the grocery store
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
so we've we've taken and put that
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the reach
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
in general
in

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
the the vast majority of seizures and
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
forfeitures are below
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars in value so this is
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's fairly uncommon to come across
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
the the big
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
dealers which is what we're looking for
 
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.790 align:start position:0%
dealers which is what we're looking for
but

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
so we're really trying to focus on
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
the state process
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
the criminal
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and unifying those
 
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:04.470 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and unifying those
processes

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
on top page three
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
we make sure that the defendant does not
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
waive their rights they cannot waive
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
their right
 
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
their right
so

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
typically if you have
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
something a car of 2 000 value
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're not going to
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer to try and
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
get that car back it's going to cost you
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
more than two thousand dollars just for
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
the lawyer so you're basically out that
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
so you want to make sure that
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
taking assets that uh
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be waived so that there is
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
some um
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
protection there
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
down at line 23 on page three
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is where the current
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
civil side of things begins and it puts
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
civil side of things begins and it puts
aside

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
aside
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.430 align:start position:0%
aside
um

00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the department of justice would have
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
to file within 60 days to
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
lock in that that
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
asset so that it's
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
becomes part of or tied to a criminal
 
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
becomes part of or tied to a criminal
process

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
adding the
 
00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.470 align:start position:0%
adding the
asset

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
asset
 
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.349 align:start position:0%
asset
to

00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
the duties of the public defender
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
because we're unifying this process
 
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.470 align:start position:0%
because we're unifying this process
the

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
the court all the lawyers involved the
 
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.630 align:start position:0%
the court all the lawyers involved the
prosecutors

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
they know
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
all of the information having to do with
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
all of this process the the asset that
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
sieves it's got to be
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
inventoried uh if it's connected to
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
criminal activity
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to know that so all of
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
the information is there
 
00:56:05.359 --> 00:56:06.150 align:start position:0%
the information is there
this

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
this
adds

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
adds
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
protection for those who
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
are served by a public defender
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
at a very minimal expense you know the
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
the defender is already looking at the
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
case prosecutors are looking the case so
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
this just unifies it so the process can
 
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:26.390 align:start position:0%
this just unifies it so the process can
be

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
brought together
 
00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:28.789 align:start position:0%
brought together
and

00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the end that
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
that asset if there is a conviction
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
will be part of the sentencing and
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's also in here protection for
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right of proportional
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
so page four is laying out uh the
 
00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.829 align:start position:0%
so page four is laying out uh the
process

00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
involved in all the
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
the details and
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
i do believe the court will have some
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
comments on that to
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.430 align:start position:0%
the
information

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
about the asset
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
is is going to be separated from the
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
jury so that they're not
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
making a judgment based on
 
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
making a judgment based on
that

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
that
evidence

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
protections for
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
someone's mother lends a son a car and
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
she thinks her son's a good boy and well
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
it turns out maybe he's not or or he
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
just gets caught up in it and mom needs
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
that car for herself to get to work
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
we want to have protections for
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
on on lease or there's a debt owed on it
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
the the bank
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
or the the dealership would have the
 
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
or the the dealership would have the
the

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
as i say we've uh we've gone through
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
this a lot in um
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the judiciary committee over the
 
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
in the judiciary committee over the
years

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
so a lot of this is new to you i
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
understand that and it's perhaps a
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
little thick to get through
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to hit the highlights here
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
for you and i'm sure you're going to
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
have lots of questions i've also got um
 
00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:29.430 align:start position:0%
have lots of questions i've also got um
um

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
lee mcgrath from the institute for
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
justice who has been working on this
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
nationally for quite a long time
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
who will fill in the gaps from
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
then we get into some of the current
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
language on the division of the
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
forfeiture after the forfeiture has been
 
01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
forfeiture after the forfeiture has been
secured

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
secured
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
45 of the
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
monies would go to the department that
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
sees the asset 45 would go to the
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general's drug
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund and 10 percent goes to
 
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.109 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund and 10 percent goes to
the

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services for
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
drug rehabilitation
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
and such
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
also included in this
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
no that is not it
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
sorry all of my notes are
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
tucked away
 
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
tucked away
um

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
so instead of my uh rambling further i
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
guess i'll take questions and if you
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
have technical questions
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
you might save those for the
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
the attorney behind me
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll uh i'll
 
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.549 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll uh i'll
conclude

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative pantalakis
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking this question
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
why are we digging into the fortune
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
professor law so deeply
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we're digging into
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
why we're digging into this law so
 
01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.789 align:start position:0%
why we're digging into this law so
deeply

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
well because we want to uh provide to
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
assets seized and possibly unjustly
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
second question
 
01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
second question
follow

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
they are coming into this state selling
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
our kids drugs and killing them
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
why should we give them any breaks
 
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.990 align:start position:0%
why should we give them any breaks
well

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
respectfully the uh the process assumes
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
so someone has been convicted in uh
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
so someone has been convicted in uh
court

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
their property has been seized
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
and they have filed for an appeal
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
their appeal
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
results in a overturn of their
 
01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
results in a overturn of their
conviction

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
is their property returned
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that is the intent and until the process
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
is done um
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
their their property is still their
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
property and we may need to
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
look at the language here to make sure
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that is correct and uh attorney
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
mcgrath would
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
have a better answer to that than i
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question i did have
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
a quick question you have an exclusion
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
around contraband
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this statute what
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
what is considered contraband
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
so a contraband would be
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
certain any illegal drugs
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
drugs with no prescription
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.549 align:start position:0%
 
geez

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
geez
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
i suppose anything that's not legal to
 
01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:41.910 align:start position:0%
i suppose anything that's not legal to
have

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%

thank you and thank you for taking the
 
01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.109 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
so my name is on this
 
01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
so my name is on this
um

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
although i'm not
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
i guess that notwithstanding i'm
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what you're trying to do
 
01:04:07.839 --> 01:04:09.029 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what you're trying to do
with

01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and the changes you
 
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.230 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and the changes you
proposed

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm a little bit curious about and
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear a clear answer is
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
why take a one-page bill
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
and come back with a
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
10-page amendment
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
10-page amendment
that

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
does nothing but
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh muddy
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
what you had previously proposed
 
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
what you had previously proposed
well

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
i suppose my my explanation probably
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
muddies things pretty much um
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
but uh we started out with
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
a very simple bill and admittedly uh
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is a a rather grand expansion and
 
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
this is a a rather grand expansion and
this

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh came about with uh discussions with
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh chairman abbas who's much more
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with the process in court
 
01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
familiar with the process in court
and

01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
it was basically his idea and uh
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
maine has a process like this
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
which unifies these these uh the
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil process so that
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
while it it's
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
hard to digest no doubt much more
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
difficult than the
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
the simple one that we even had a fair
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
bit of discussion about
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is a process
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
that is seeking to protect innocent
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
people from having their
 
01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
people from having their
assets

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
assets
taken

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
taken
unjustly

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
unjustly
 
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
unjustly
and

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
i don't mind criminals losing their
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
assets that's perfectly fine they should
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they should be you know balanced
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
with our constitutional um
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
command that it be proportional
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
so these are some of the issues that
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses it yes it is a
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
grand expansion from what you started
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
with but it's something that we've been
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
and when we
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
we instituted the policy within the
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
state to have criminal forfeit
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.789 align:start position:0%
state to have criminal forfeit
forfeiture

01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
instead of civil asset forfeiture that
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
criminal process
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
protects due process
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment and this bill
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
my name is lee mcgrath i'm the senior
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislative council for the institute
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
for justice
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
crime should not pay
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
it is legitimate for the state of new
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire to confiscate the fruit of
 
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire to confiscate the fruit of
crime

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
nothing in that bill changes the
 
01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
nothing in that bill changes the
principle

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is improve upon the
 
01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:02.789 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is improve upon the
policy

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
that you enacted in 2016.
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
in 2016 you said it was important
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 522
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
to have a conviction
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
in criminal court as a prerequisite to
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
what we've subsequently learned is that
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's a better way of achieving that
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
policy goal of ensuring that no one
 
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.109 align:start position:0%
policy goal of ensuring that no one
acquitted

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
acquitted
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
and the better
 
01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:41.190 align:start position:0%
and the better
way

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
of achieving
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's current policy
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
is in this amendment it is to merge
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
prosecution and the forfeiture
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
litigation into one single
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
single process
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
in one single courtroom
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
with one
 
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.589 align:start position:0%
with one
single

01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:04.549 align:start position:0%
single
judge

01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
defense attorney and and and prosecutor
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
so the way in which you might
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
conceptualize this is stream
 
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.029 align:start position:0%
conceptualize this is stream
streamlining

01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
streamlining
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
streamlining it into a single process in
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
which all the evidence is introduced in
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
the criminal prosecution and then after
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
conviction with all that evidence
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
introduced the judge
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
as part of the post-conviction
 
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
as part of the post-conviction
determination

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
can determine
 
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.510 align:start position:0%
can determine
whether

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
title should transfer
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
whether the car is an instrument of the
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
crime whether the cash is the proceeds
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the of the cr of the crime
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
all in one all in one
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
process all streamlined so you might
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
think of what this bill does
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
as making the loss
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
of title to property
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
taking it out of a civil process and
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
making it look a lot more like a
 
01:09:08.799 --> 01:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
making it look a lot more like a
sentence

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
a post-conviction determination by the
 
01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
a post-conviction determination by the
judge

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.390 align:start position:0%
judge
that

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rightly confiscates title
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
to some to some
 
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.789 align:start position:0%
to some to some
property

01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
north carolina has done it since the
 
01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
north carolina has done it since the
1990s

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
1990s
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
new mexico nebraska and just last
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
session maine adopted this
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
simplification this unifi unification
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
there are certain there are lots of
 
01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:43.829 align:start position:0%
there are certain there are lots of
benefits

01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
to this
one

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
one
is

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
you avoid you would ensure that an
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
indigent person
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
gets representation
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
not only of himself
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
but also his property
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
through the public
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.239 --> 01:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
by uniting
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
the process all in criminal court you
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
avoid a big but relatively unknown
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.189 align:start position:0%
avoid a big but relatively unknown
problem

01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
the in the two-track system
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
there are lots of people who don't
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
pursue the civil litigation and they
 
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
pursue the civil litigation and they
default

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
default
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
they may be subsequently acquitted but
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
because they have defaulted they haven't
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
answered the notices they haven't
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
answered the civil complaint they
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
haven't hired an attorney to represent
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
them in civil court they lose title
 
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.830 align:start position:0%
them in civil court they lose title
automatically

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens in the
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
so by uniting these two
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
you avoid what we have found in other
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
states that can range between 80 and 90
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
percent of the cases in civil
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
court end in default
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
maine doesn't have that problem
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
nebraska new mexico north carolina don't
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
have that default problem it's all done
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
in one one single single pro process
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in criminal
 
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.630 align:start position:0%
requirement in criminal
court

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
that triggers the loss of title
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
can be achieved through a plea bargain
 
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
can be achieved through a plea bargain
or

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
it can
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
it can be achieved should the suspect
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
choose to help law enforcement help
 
01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:53.270 align:start position:0%
choose to help law enforcement help
prosecutors

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
in exchange for a less dramatic
 
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.189 align:start position:0%
in exchange for a less dramatic
incarceration

01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
title it can be achieved there's an
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
exception for death deportation fleeing
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
and a abandonment and so the bill builds
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the pragmatism
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the prosecutor will want as part of
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
the criminal prosecution as it relates
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
to transferring title
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to to this to the state through through
 
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.390 align:start position:0%
to to this to the state through through
forfeiture

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the second big benefit mr chairman
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
this protects spouses
 
01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:34.390 align:start position:0%
this protects spouses
wives

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
wives
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
girlfriends boyfriend boyfriends
 
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
girlfriends boyfriend boyfriends
parents

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
it changes how they go into court and
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
try to get back their property that
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
their husband their boy their boyfriend
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
used without their consent
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
it changes the innocent owner claimant
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
and his ability or her ability to go
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
into into court and say
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't he didn't i've always had the
 
01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
i didn't he didn't i've always had the
keys

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
keys
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't want him to use the car he took
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
the keys he took the car against my will
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill does that
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
both as part of a prompt post seizure
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
hearing known as a crimstock hearing and
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
it also does it by creating a a process
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
a process for the girlfriend
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the wife to to go in and say here's
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
my title i didn't consent to the use of
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
this his use of the your car the car
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
finally mr chairman one thing this bill
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the distribution of
 
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the distribution of
proceeds

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
and so
it

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
when forfeited when that car has title
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
transfers to the state
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
and the car sold or the cash transfers
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the state it will still be
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
distributed as current law
 
01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:03.510 align:start position:0%
distributed as current law
distributed

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
distributed
so

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
in conclusion mr chairman
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
this is a more efficient
 
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.950 align:start position:0%
this is a more efficient
process

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
a simpler process
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it is the process
 
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
and it is the process
that

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
realizes new hampshire's policy that it
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
has had for six years
 
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
has had for six years
of

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
of first a conviction and then
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i stand ready to answer the
 
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.709 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i stand ready to answer the
committees

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:35.830 align:start position:0%
committees
including

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
greene thank you mr chair thank you for
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
what if the property was in a trust how
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
how does this work
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair mr chairman representative give
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
me an example so
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
usually the example is someone's driving
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
along the highway
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
and they get stopped the car is seized
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
the cash is seized but give me the
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that you're thinking of
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
well the person's property
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
their land their home their automobiles
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
is all set up in a trust yes how would
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
that be affected
 
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.669 align:start position:0%
that be affected
so

01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
it would operate the same that
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
that the
person

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
that this is principally a crime
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that person committed
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
the person committed a crime
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then did he use that land did he use
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
that land to to make
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
to to make uh
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
let me expand your hypothetical right uh
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
as a as a lab for for meth
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
then he loses if convicted he loses
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
loses a title and that trust is pierced
 
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
loses a title and that trust is pierced
okay

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir which is a
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up to his yes
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
put the trust in two people's names yes
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
one is the criminal one isn't what
 
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
one is the criminal one isn't what
happens

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
so this is the innocent let's for the
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
sake of ease let's say the criminal is
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
the husband and the
 
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
the husband and the
the

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
she can go into court
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
she can
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
she can
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
she can argue look i own this property i
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
don't own half of it i own my 100
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
share of it
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
i did not
consent

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
for him to use the the trust assets as
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
part of the crime i'd i did not cons i
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
did not know he was baking meth
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the in the basement
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
i've never i haven't been to the house
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
she is an innocent owner claimant she
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
walks into court
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
and the burden is on the state to show
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
that she did know she did consent she
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
did have actual actual knowledge
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so her interests are protected
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
whether they are in a trust or whether
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
she owns them herself
 
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
she owns them herself
follow-up

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm using my own particular
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
situation yes sir my wife and i are in
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
all everything we own is in trust and we
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
both kind of enjoy each whatever
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
benefits if something happens to either
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
one of us
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
so in that case
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
because the criminal side of that trust
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is equally in joint
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
everybody loses
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you and your wife are conspired mr
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
chairman dare i extend the hypothetical
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
if you and your wife are both charged
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
and you and your wife are both convicted
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
you and your wife lose the land that was
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
an instrument of your crime yes but the
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
hypoth the earlier hypothetical was one
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
where she was completely innocent
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
she still loses she
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
in the where she is where she is a a
 
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.669 align:start position:0%
in the where she is where she is a a
defendant

01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
a co-defendant with you
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
and you and she are convicted
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
both of you lose the property when it is
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
shown to be the instrument of the crime
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
well let me just answer
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
what he's saying is that if
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
she does not lose if you are convicted
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
and she didn't know what you were doing
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
she would be able to go to this hearing
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
and say that i had no idea and the state
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
would have to prove she did does that
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
answer your question i i believe so mr
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you yeah thanks thank you
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
um representative hearn
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
um forfeiture cases are there in new
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a reporting
 
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a reporting
requirement

01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately the attorney general
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
has met not met those requirements so we
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
do not have a fixed number on the we do
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
not know exactly how many forfeiture
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
cases there are in
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
you don't know exactly follow up fall
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
off you don't know exactly but do you
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
have an average
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry to use the word exactly mr
 
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.830 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry to use the word exactly mr
chairman

01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.149 align:start position:0%
chairman
no

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
i'm informed we have a member of the
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
ag's office who's going to testify
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman we do know
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
that since 2000 to 2019
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire state law
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's been approximately 3 million
 
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
there's been approximately 3 million
dollars

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
for forfeited under state state law
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's different from the 22 million
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's forfeited under under federal
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
you could take
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
3 million divided by 20 20 years
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
and you have roughly 150 000 dollars a
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
year is forfeited
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
if i did the math correctly in my head
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
forfeited under new hampshire state
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the original bill
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the second sentence follows up on uh
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative marston's thing that that
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
takes the the um
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
who has to prove it the claimant
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
used to have to prove it now the state
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
has to prove it would that be a correct
 
01:21:04.639 --> 01:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
has to prove it would that be a correct
thing

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
and let me just ask a question finish
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
the question with the
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
the first sentence talks about
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
whatever we are talking about as the
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
property has to be in proximity
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if that proximity
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
requirement in the sentence that was
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
taken out is covered in the new bill
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman representative i do not
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
believe that that issue of proximity
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
is imported from existing law
 
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
is imported from existing law
into

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh into the
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
into the amendment
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh i will need to check whether it was
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
deleted or not from the from the
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and i will i will
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
do that and inform
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia to report report
 
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.709 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia to report report
back

01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
the key component to to this
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that once convicted in criminal court
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's relatively easy
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
to show
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
that the car was an instrument of the
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
crime and the cash was the proceeds of
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
the crime
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
because in that conviction
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
prosecution in that prosecution evidence
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
gets introduced
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
and so the sort of technicality that the
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.790 align:start position:0%
original bill
bill

01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
attempted to to address
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
implicit and i'll check to see
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we deleted it if it's deleted but
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that it is it is uh it is implicitly
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
addressed by the fact that the cr that
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
all of this is happening in criminal
 
01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:56.229 align:start position:0%
all of this is happening in criminal
court

01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
you might
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
i need a little clarification on what
 
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.270 align:start position:0%
i need a little clarification on what
happens

01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
if property is seized that
 
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
if property is seized that
uh

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
belongs to someone else for example
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
you're a drug arrested
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
the car is being used is
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
only partially owned by the
 
01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
only partially owned by the
defendant

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
that car is seized
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
but the business that owns the car
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
it loses
 
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.910 align:start position:0%
it loses
of

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
that property
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
do they lose it forever or
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
representative

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so you're right
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's this there are two types of
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
property owners that this bill is
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
addressing one is the defendant but
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
let's focus in on the other type of
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
property owner that your question
 
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.310 align:start position:0%
property owner that your question
addresses

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that is the the lender
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the fleet owner
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
the secured creditor the wife the
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
girlfriend the boyfriend the parent the
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
grandparent the the neighbor these are
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
all taken care of
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
in two ways
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
one is and
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
that that person can go into court
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
in a prompt post seizure hearing and say
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
wait a second
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm the secured lender i didn't
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
authorize him to or consent to his using
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
using the car or the wife i didn't know
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
about his using the car so there is a
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
prompt post-seizure hearing that can
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
take place as in as few as in 10 days to
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
get back for the innocent owner claimant
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
and the secured creditor to get back
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
what if there is no innocent uh party
 
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.270 align:start position:0%
what if there is no innocent uh party
and

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for months to a year for
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
trial and they have they basically have
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
lost uh use of their property
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman if i could representative
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
let me just clarify we're back talking
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
about the defendant
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay so the defendant
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
is stopped his car is seized
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
he's charged with a crime
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes that car sits in the impound
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
impound lot
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
unless there are some mitigating
 
01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
unless there are some mitigating
circumstances

01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
circumstances
that

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
he he can go and ask for a prompt
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
post-seizure hearing as as well but he
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
will have a harder time
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
and so he does lose
 
01:25:51.199 --> 01:25:52.229 align:start position:0%
and so he does lose
lose

01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh lose use
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
of that car during the criminal
 
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.070 align:start position:0%
of that car during the criminal
prosecution

01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
but if he could show in the post-prompt
 
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
but if he could show in the post-prompt
seizure

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing that perhaps the stop was
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
wrong unconstitutional then he can go
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
and have this crime stock this prompt
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
just stand by just one quick question
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
is it third
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
is a third party able to intervene for
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
example um bank of america owns the car
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's financed could they intervene and
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
say we want to repossess this car yes
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
prior to waiting for the conviction yes
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
prompt post-seizure hearing
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
famous case crimstock
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
that gets gets bank of america
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
gets the wife
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
right into court
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
very fast
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait
 
01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.229 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait
for

01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
everything that's happening to the
 
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
everything that's happening to the
defendant

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
represent bournemouth you're following
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
so now we're no longer talking about car
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about land that was seized
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
and that land was seized as part of
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and of course a lot of land is not owned
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
all outright by the defendant it's owned
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
jointly by them and
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
as part of the
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
criminal procedure proceedings the land
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
is seized by
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
defendant is convicted
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh he appeals his uh
 
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.629 align:start position:0%
uh he appeals his uh
uh

01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh conviction
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
and the verdict is overruled
 
01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
and the verdict is overruled
meanwhile

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
meanwhile
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
many months have gone by
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
the bank our lending organization
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
has missed payment
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
the defendant
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
may have lost control of
 
01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:17.270 align:start position:0%
may have lost control of
the

01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
land itself so he has no other place to
 
01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
land itself so he has no other place to
live

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
and after a year two years i don't know
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
how long these cases drag on they could
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
the defendant has lost
 
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.189 align:start position:0%
the defendant has lost
uh

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
he's no longer able to afford to pay the
 
01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
he's no longer able to afford to pay the
loan

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
loan
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
the bank says
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm seizing your this property even
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
though you've been found guilty innocent
 
01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.229 align:start position:0%
though you've been found guilty innocent
and

01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
 
01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
representative

01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
this is a good hypo this is a good
 
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.669 align:start position:0%
this is a good hypo this is a good
hypothetical

01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
so we're focused in once again on the
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
def on the defendant we're not focused
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
in on the innocent owner claimant the
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
wife or the or the
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
the the bank
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
banking laws
 
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
banking laws
exist

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
and must be followed and you must pay
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not not change
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
the authority or the power of bank of a
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the len lent lender
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
to reclaim the property when the
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
when the
uh

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bank can still proceed under new
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire banking laws
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
to take title
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
when they're
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
when the borrower fails to pay
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
in in this hypothetical
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
and it does land doesn't happen a lot
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
most of this is cars and cash but in
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
this hypothetical
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes this
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
banking laws are not part of this bill
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
do not get changed if he fails to make
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
his payments
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
the bank may exercise their right to
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
say that a person
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
the wife or the mother or the father
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
are innocent
 
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
are innocent
people

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
but my question is is are they
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the drug money
 
01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.110 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the drug money
that

01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
has been seized
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative no
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
that the proceeds from drug sales by the
 
01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.030 align:start position:0%
that the proceeds from drug sales by the
defendant

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
when if the state can show that it went
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the to the to the payment of
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the car the periodic car payments
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
then that person is then the wife is not
 
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
then that person is then the wife is not
innocent

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
the fruit of crime
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
the instruments of crime
 
01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.669 align:start position:0%
the instruments of crime
shouldn't

01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
it should should
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
should go to the state and that's the
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
underlying concept of the of the bill
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
i think you're misunderstanding what i'm
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
saying i am saying if the wife or the
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
mother or any of them
 
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.310 align:start position:0%
mother or any of them
is

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
benefiting like
 
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.669 align:start position:0%
benefiting like
paying

01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
paying
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
rent or food or anything else from this
 
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.030 align:start position:0%
rent or food or anything else from this
money

01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
would you say that they shouldn't
 
01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.550 align:start position:0%
would you say that they shouldn't
be

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative would you mind the last
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
part of your question i i i missed
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the car the wife or
 
01:32:08.639 --> 01:32:09.510 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the car the wife or
um

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
mother or father is innocent
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
and they should have their car
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
but are they benefiting
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
like getting food
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
rent and whatnot
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman
 
01:32:27.199 --> 01:32:35.990 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman
representative

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
is focused on taking
 
01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:41.830 align:start position:0%
is focused on taking
fruits

01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
fruits
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go so far as to engage in the
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
moral condemnation
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
of someone who may
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
who's not a criminal who is not charged
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
but who may be able to buy food because
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
the defendant gave them a few bucks
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go that far
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question the only question i
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
have is this let's let's say we're
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
focusing on the defendant
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this bill
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would require the state in the
 
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.229 align:start position:0%
that would require the state in the
criminal

01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
trial of the defendant
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
to prove the the
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
the the facts that make let's say the
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
car subject to forfeiture
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman representative lin no
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay so all of that happens
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
in a post-conviction hearing all right
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
so in other words the state in a if i
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
may follow up in
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
if in the criminal case itself
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's not particularly important to the
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
state in proving its case to show
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
who owned the car that the defendant
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
arrived in and all that and it would be
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
sort of extraneous they can they can
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
not bother with that stuff in the
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
criminal trial and then deal with it
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
later mr chairman representative lin yes
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
but talking on the amendment
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
the change
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
a big change that is making to a current
 
01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.790 align:start position:0%
a big change that is making to a current
law

01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
once a person is found
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
guilty in the court case
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
or found innocent
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
immediately after that the judge decides
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
what about all this stuff
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
what about the money but about the car
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct uh mr chair
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative you're very close
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
indulge me for just a second and then
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in 2016
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
it says conviction in 2000 it's not in
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in 2016
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
sb 522
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
said we want convictions to happen as a
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to losing
 
01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to losing
losing

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
losing
 
01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.310 align:start position:0%
losing
title

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
title
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
this bill takes that concept that was
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
takes that concept
 
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.109 align:start position:0%
takes that concept
and

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
perfects it and proves it into the
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
single process that you just described
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
so the answer to your question is yes
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's all happening in the criminal court
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
the criminal prosecution
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
the person must be first
 
01:35:53.199 --> 01:35:54.629 align:start position:0%
the person must be first
convicted

01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
if he is acquitted the case is over the
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
car gets returned the cash gets returned
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
so now for something totally
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
on on page two of the of the amendment
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh starting down around line 30
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's talking about 200 or less or a
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
of 2 000 or less
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.639 --> 01:36:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%

a two thousand dollar car probably can't
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
pass inspection
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
what about my car that's like brand new
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
and like it's ten thousand dollars or
 
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
and like it's ten thousand dollars or
whatever

01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
why the 2000 what's the purpose of that
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman of representative true

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
this
is

01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
a get out of free get out of free
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
be completely this is an amount of of
 
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
be completely this is an amount of of
minimal

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
dollars minimal
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
car value that is so small
 
01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
car value that is so small
that

01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're not even going to allow these
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
assets to enter into the system
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted to make it so that it
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
was to point out that there are some
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
types of assets that are so small so
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
minimal that it is cost inefficient for
 
01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.270 align:start position:0%
minimal that it is cost inefficient for
everyone

01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the police the prosecutor the public
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
defender the criminal defense lawyer to
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
even bother
 
01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
even bother
with

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
with trying to link certain assets to a
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
to a to a crime
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
and so the goal was to make it small not
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
like not big
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair hi i'm a substitute
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
for today i'm representative schultz
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
from concord thank you for taking my
 
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
from concord thank you for taking my
question

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
because hearing the other questions
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
leads me to think of one regarding that
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
same section
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.229 align:start position:0%
and that is
um

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
how do i put this
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
some ladies have really bad taste in
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
guys and they may
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
not have any means if everything is
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
seized to take care of themselves or
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't there be a provision
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
that would account for their
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
financial well-being for at least a
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
period of time while they transition
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
i hate to see
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
children families being
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
punished for the criminal behavior of a
 
01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
punished for the criminal behavior of a
spouse

01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
yeah like i said some ladies have really
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
just for the record the chair would like
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
to state that that
 
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
to state that that
the

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
i was waiting for that
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
mr representative schultz
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
so you are right to focus on the
 
01:39:18.159 --> 01:39:19.189 align:start position:0%
so you are right to focus on the
innocent

01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
01:39:19.199 --> 01:39:20.229 align:start position:0%
innocent
person

01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and not the defendant
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
and love oftentimes doesn't isn't so so
 
01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.669 align:start position:0%
and love oftentimes doesn't isn't so so
rational

01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
rational
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
so what the bill rightly does addresses
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
your concern
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
the bill rightly does two does three
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
things two things two important things
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
one it allows that
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
wife that girlfriend that husband that
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
boyfriend to get
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
into court fast
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the prompt post seizure
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
hearing i'm referring to crimstock is
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
the name of the case
 
01:39:58.239 --> 01:39:59.350 align:start position:0%
the name of the case
that's

01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's her greatest salvation
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
the second thing that it does
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
to her benefit
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
it flips the burden of proof
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
if she shows up and says here's my title
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
see it's got my name on it
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
then the burden of proof flips to the
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
government to show that she actually did
 
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.390 align:start position:0%
government to show that she actually did
consent

01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
and did have actual knowledge
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
the confis her getting the car back
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
is faster
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
and easier
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
under this bill by the prom procedure
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and the flipping of the burden
 
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
hearing and the flipping of the burden
of

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the flipping of this
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
represent muse
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if this amendment
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
effectively eliminates
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
civil asset fortune forfeiture in the
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative yes as it
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
relates to these crimes
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
it is an unnecessary
 
01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.830 align:start position:0%
it is an unnecessary
process

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.709 align:start position:0%
process
that

01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the that
 
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.310 align:start position:0%
that the that
the

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
that is inconsistent with the policy
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
established by the by the state
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's no rewards no extra rewards here
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
for convicted drug dealers
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're not crime shouldn't
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
crime shouldn't pay
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
streamlining unifying
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the process to protect those who
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
haven't been charged those who have been
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
acquitted and in this case those who are
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
innocent owner
 
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.270 align:start position:0%
innocent owner
claimants

01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.070 align:start position:0%
claimants
so

01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
the best way to think about that mr
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
chairman if you would indulge me for
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
just a second
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
is when does civil forfeiture
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the port of boston
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
if portsmouth has support the port of
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth it makes sense when the owner
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the property is in england or ireland
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
or argentina
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement can't get can't get
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
personal jurisdiction
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
over that owner of the property and
 
01:42:30.719 --> 01:42:32.229 align:start position:0%
over that owner of the property and
therefore

01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
in rem
 
01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
in rem
jurisdiction

01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
litigation against the property in civil
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
court makes perfect sense in admiralty
 
01:42:41.679 --> 01:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
court makes perfect sense in admiralty
law

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
because the state of new hampshire has
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
not gained personal jurisdiction over
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
the human being
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
by contrast
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill says look we do gain personal
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the human being so
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
therefore let's not engage in this
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
artifice of litigating against a car and
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%

state question
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
i have practical questions um
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering do we have other
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
witnesses who are intending to testify
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
on this that maybe would be best suited
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
to answer some questions yes
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you mr chair
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
the comedian now calls attorney attorney
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch i did want to take
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
you through um the bill or the amendment
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
briefly we haven't had a lot of time to
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
digest it so there's probably other
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
things that we could talk about but
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
sort of big picture is there are a
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill that will need to
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
be worked on it is it has sort of
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with either the current
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
system of
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
circuit court superior court
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
has fiscal impacts that i'll briefly
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
with regard to the overall policy of the
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
judicial branch does not take a position
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
some of these are just nits but they're
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
things that just need to be addressed at
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
some point so running through the bill
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 11
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
references municipal district or
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
superior court there are no municipal
 
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.350 align:start position:0%
superior court there are no municipal
courts

01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
the district court is a division now of
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
the circuit court so it's district
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
division of circuit court you can just
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
reference circuit court there instead of
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
either municipal or
 
01:44:58.239 --> 01:45:00.790 align:start position:0%
either municipal or
district

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
um starting at the top line three
 
01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:07.189 align:start position:0%
um starting at the top line three
um

01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
is the is the waiver provision you heard
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh discussed earlier
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
at least what i think that means and
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's intended to mean and this would
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
be a policy of the committee that you
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
would have to adopt
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
is that it says a document purporting to
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
waive interest or rights and seize
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
property shall be
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
void and inadmissible in court
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
that would mean in the event so for
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
example during the the uh
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
a sentencing or a plea bargain
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
this would be a separate type of process
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
that could not be waived by the
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
defendant in the course of engaging in
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
their plea bargain at least we think
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what is intended by the
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
way it's written so that you would have
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
to have still have a separate proceeding
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
even if the party wanted to uh to waive
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
the interest
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
continuing on down uh page three
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
16 to 18 which i think
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
is current language talks about the
 
01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:09.990 align:start position:0%
is current language talks about the
initiation

01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
initiation
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
of administrative or judicial
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
proceedings against the property
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly we couldn't quite
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
figure out how that ties to page 4 line
 
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.709 align:start position:0%
figure out how that ties to page 4 line
32

01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
32
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
which talks about the
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
in a case in which the state seeks
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
forfeiture a property the prosecuting
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
authority shall file with the court and
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
notice a proposed forfeiture
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
we just were unclear as to how those two
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings were being tied together in
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
continuing on page 3 lines 21-22
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the attorney
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
general's office determines that the
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
proceedings probably cannot be sustained
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and talks about making a written report
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
of findings uh to the seizing agency and
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
of appropriate uh authorized and direct
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
the release of the property there's no
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
connection there to if there's to the
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
courts and what the courts are told if
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
these if these occur there seems to be a
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
procedural gap in that particular
 
01:47:11.119 --> 01:47:13.270 align:start position:0%
procedural gap in that particular
section

01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
if we turn to page four
 
01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.590 align:start position:0%
if we turn to page four
um

01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a a
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
significant shift in terms of some cost
 
01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:23.669 align:start position:0%
significant shift in terms of some cost
issues

01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
so on line eight
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
talks about it being a part of the
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution and following a
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and following a conviction for felony
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
violation of the chapter
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on in the next line
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
line 10 of page four if a defendant in a
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
criminal matter is represented by a
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
um the public defender shall represent
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the defendant that has the potential to
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact on the public
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
defender's office i don't know if they
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
were reached out to
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
judicial council which deals with
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
indigent defense costs in terms of the
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
ultimate fiscal impact of that type of a
 
01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
ultimate fiscal impact of that type of a
provision

01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
again not weighing in on the policy but
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
that has a potential significant impact
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
not only on just fiscal but also
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
workload which i imagine you've heard
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
the just the extreme workload pressures
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
that the public defender is currently
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
operating under
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
continuing on
 
01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:22.870 align:start position:0%
continuing on
page

01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
4 line 14 and 15 talks about giving
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
post-seizure hearings a priority on the
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
court's docket there are a number of
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature asks the
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
courts to put as a priority and the more
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
things you put as a priority it just
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
means that other things are getting
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
pushed we have a limited number of
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
judges limited number of of of ways in
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
which cases can be managed so the more
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
that gets pushed towards a priority
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
other things civil cases uh get pushed
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the rear of the line just
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
almost by physics as you push more into
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
the into the expedited uh or priority
 
01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
the into the expedited uh or priority
dockets

01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
dockets
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
looking at again page four line 20-21
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is i think
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
an issue that may not be
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is is taken out of some
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
some national language i imagine where
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court and superior court and
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that is currently in in
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
that passed
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee that would
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
rewind felonies first
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
particular language in this bill
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
assuming the felonies first rewind
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
occurs has a just a a significant impact
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
on the circuit courts because under
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
under the rewind of felonies first
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
felonies would first be heard in the
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the probable cause hearings would be
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
heard in circuit court they're then
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
bound over their felonies they get bound
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
over the superior court so there's not
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
sort of the same judge same trial same
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
same court in those proceedings there's
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
a bounded bound over process where those
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
go to the superior court
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
but the probable cause hearing is done
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
in the in the circuit court if felonies
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
first is in fact rewound under house
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1597.
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's then also unclear in lines 22 of 23
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
of page 4 where the party may move for
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
an extension of no more than 10 days
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
so again is that an extension that would
 
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
so again is that an extension that would
be

01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know essentially when would that
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
extension request be made from a
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
management of caseloads is this
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
occurring at the probable cause hearing
 
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.589 align:start position:0%
occurring at the probable cause hearing
stage

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
stage
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
is that occurring essentially on the day
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the probable cause hearing some
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
number of days before
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know exactly when is that happening
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
because as a court management process
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know these cases are being scheduled
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
and as a result of what goes on the
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
schedule other things do not go on the
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
schedule so if we're learning about a a
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
request for an extension of 10 days on
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
the day something is scheduled that's a
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
gap that we could have filled with other
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
cases and other other activities and
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
then it requires 10 days
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about management of
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
an incredibly complicated docket process
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
so the circuit court as of the end of
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
december had
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
just under 200 000 cases pending so we
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
are managing a huge volume of cases on a
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis and the clerks are
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing just a remarkable job in doing
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
that any time you bump something 10 days
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
that ripple in the system sort of has a
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
an overall impact on the on the
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
management of cases within the circuit
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
court so it's not you know it reads very
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
simply it's just a 10-day extension it
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
has and those types of things have
 
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:53.830 align:start position:0%
has and those types of things have
significant

01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
just case management docket management
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
impacts within the circuit court
 
01:51:59.599 --> 01:52:08.149 align:start position:0%
impacts within the circuit court
um

01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's some there's just some some
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
language we're unclear of so if you turn
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
to page five line nine
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh the prosecuting attorney shall serve
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
amendment and notice as provided by the
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
rules of the court
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure if that means the
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
indictment or a complaint or or whatever
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and by the way throughout this there's
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
references to petitions
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
and if those are in civil cases at least
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and some of this does seem to imply
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
filings that are occurring outside of
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
the criminal docket those would be
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
complaints not petitions
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
for the most part anyway
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
so but there's there's a
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
certain amount of uncertainty as to
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know when some of these some of
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
these petitions that show up later in
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bill or in this amendment would
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
would come into play
 
01:52:59.679 --> 01:53:02.629 align:start position:0%
would come into play
um

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
and and also by the way you know the
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
reference to the court's rules these are
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
rules that we're going to need to create
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
and there's going to have to be some
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a a process in which these rules
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
exist both in the circuit court in the
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
superior court if we're talking about
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
felonies that are going to get bound
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
over if in fact felonies first rewind
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
does take place and ultimately the
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
looking at page
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
six of the amendment lines five and six
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
the defendant may petition the court to
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
determine before trial at trial or upon
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
conviction whether the force return is
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally excessive
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
unclear again if that's being filed in
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
the criminal docket if that's a new
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
petition that's being filed in superior
 
01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.709 align:start position:0%
petition that's being filed in superior
court

01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
not a lot of clarity in terms of what is
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of that petition when it's
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
being filed and into what case it's
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
being filed
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
similarly on line 30 of page six um
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
another opportunity
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
for the court to be
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
scheduling the hearings on petitions
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
within 30 days after it's filing
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
or at the court's discretion so
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that that's a request for
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
an expedited
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
process but but again somewhat unclear
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
in that point i made earlier about any
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
time you put deadlines on something for
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
the court you're you're pushing
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
something else out in a in a fairly
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the innocent property
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
owner defense on page 7
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
not a lot of definition is provided to
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
that it simply says what the innocent
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
owner would would have to submit
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then provides an opportunity for the
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
court to hear the petition again
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that petition is
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
where it's being filed and is it we're
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
assuming it's now a new civil case but
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
again in terms of of the outline uh of
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
what's contained in the in the amendment
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
if if i may respectfully um
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you have quite a
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
voluminous uh
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
oh are you okay what i'm going to ask is
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
submit that to us you can send an email
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
with that list i can i can sort of clean
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
it up a little and try to send something
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the sponsor to
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
coordinate um
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
also as well with the representative
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
from the court system if you tend on
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
getting another amendment to us
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask the
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
members to refrain from questions
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
so that we can move this along unless
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
anyone has a really important question
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
they'd like to ask
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
this the original bill came to us
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
without a fiscal note and based on your
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
testimony it looks like from a cost
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
perspective we may be doing more than
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
just shuffling the deck here can you
 
01:56:01.199 --> 01:56:03.270 align:start position:0%
just shuffling the deck here can you
quantify

01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
quantify
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the additional cost or personnel that
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
might be required
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
these additional process steps and
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
additional hearings
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i can't quantify
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
it um and and in part it will depend
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
upon where felonies first rewind um goes
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
even if
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
it and then separately there's a there's
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
a cost that would have to be associated
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the indigent defense costs
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
so public defenders office and the
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
judicial council would have to sort of
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
evaluate how many additional cases would
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
be would be generated
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of this
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
and and sort of what the additional
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
procedures would would trigger um so so
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
the short answer is i i don't have a a
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
an estimate today
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and we haven't had really enough
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
time with the amendment to sort of
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
start to evaluate that level of it
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
but but certainly there is a fiscal
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
impact generally
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls buzz share
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
i would ask the remaining four witnesses
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
if they could possibly keep their
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
testimony to two minutes as we're
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh my name is buzz
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
my name is both sher um
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
for the record uh i'm a police
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner in portsmouth a law
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
professor at unh law my opinions are
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
those are mine only and not of unh law
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
or the portsmouth police commission
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
i won't be uncharacteristically brief
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
um this uh i am
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
the concept behind this bill i'm very
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
supportive of
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh historically the civil forfeiture
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
that said
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
i can't testify in support of it because
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
the impact on the public defender
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
program would be very significant
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it's not simply a matter
 
01:58:06.159 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it's not simply a matter
of

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know having uh having giving them
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
more money so they can hire the lawyers
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
to staff the program
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are at a point now where they're
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
trying to hire new lawyers particularly
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
lateral hires from within and without
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
the state outside the state and they're
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
not able to keep they're not able to
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
keep up at all with the the uh the
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
number of lawyers that are leaving the
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
program given the already excessive case
 
01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
program given the already excessive case
lows

01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
lows
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a bigger problem than
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
such as the you know it is a problem
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
that it would cost
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to staff up the public
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
defender program to handle this but it's
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
a bigger problem than that because even
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
if they had all the money they couldn't
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
staff it up anytime soon so uh with that
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh my testimony is over i believe i came
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
in under two minutes
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
you did ask
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you very much
 
01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
kimberly now calls jeffrey ware and
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:59:20.719 --> 01:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
committee

01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
my name is jeffrey ward i am a senior
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general and the chief
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice bureau at the
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office uh with me is
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
danielle zakowski who is the chief of
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
the drug prosecution unit um at our
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
office as part of the criminal bureau
 
01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.790 align:start position:0%
office as part of the criminal bureau
there

01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
um we are here uh with
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh this bill and the in
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the sea change that it would create and
 
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:44.629 align:start position:0%
the sea change that it would create and
how

01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh drug forfeitures
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh currently occur as well as and i'll
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat uh both what attorney
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
had said and and what attorney shear
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
said but certainly those are concerns
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh about both costs associated and an
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
already overburdened indigent defense
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
system that's well publicized
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the media that's at a crisis point um
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then would add this all on top of it
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to a court system that has
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
been that has been backed up for some
 
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.189 align:start position:0%
been that has been backed up for some
time

02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
but based on what i heard from both the
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor and those that spoke in favor of
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
this we see this really as a solution to
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
and and while we haven't had much time
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
to go over the amendment as it came in
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
rather recently
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
i would urge the members of the
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee that are considering this to
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
look at our asset forfeiture guidelines
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
that are available on our website
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
um much of the things that this seeks to
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
address we've already addressed through
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
our asset forfeiture guidelines and our
 
02:00:42.639 --> 02:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
our asset forfeiture guidelines and our
policies

02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh when dealing with asset forfeiture i
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
would also suggest to you that the idea
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
attorney head and
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the court system gave just a
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
preview of this this is not a more
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
efficient and simpler system by any
 
02:00:58.719 --> 02:00:59.830 align:start position:0%
efficient and simpler system by any
stretch

02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
stretch
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
this actually would would would
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
significantly complicate
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh the current system that we deal with
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
but the what i was what i heard in
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
hearing the and hearing the testimony
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
earlier was that this is a bill with all
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
of its machinations it seeks to protect
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
innocent people from having their assets
 
02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:16.790 align:start position:0%
innocent people from having their assets
taken

02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
taken
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
um what you didn't hear is that that's
 
02:01:18.639 --> 02:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
um what you didn't hear is that that's
happening

02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not happening
 
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.189 align:start position:0%
because it's not happening
um

02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
typically speaking in this process
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
the asset for the the forfeiture unless
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
waived or defaulted doesn't occur until
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
after a conviction
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't had an instance where there's
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
been an acquittal and an asset
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
forfeiture um and at least in at least
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
in our recent collective memory uh
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
before you hear
 
02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
before you hear
um

02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
if that were the case we'd withdraw the
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
and that's that's generally part of our
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
policies and guidelines
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
so it seeks to to to solve an issue the
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
protection of of criminally innocent
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
people from having their assets taken
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist in addition as to the
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
quote um innocent owner as it's
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
described in this statute which is not
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
and defined or necessarily identified i
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the committee
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
to be aware
 
02:02:11.599 --> 02:02:12.550 align:start position:0%
to be aware
that

02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
that
with

02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
drug dealers that we're dealing with
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
here and i know there are a lot of
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
questions about property typically
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
speaking and this is outlined in our
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines and in our protocols we don't
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
i can't recall having done it i've been
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
at the attorney general's office for
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years danielle's been there
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
almost as long training sakowski
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me we haven't taken property
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so again it's dealing with issues
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
that aren't aren't actually issues in
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
reality we currently have guidelines
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
that say we don't seize cash under a
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
we currently have guidelines that say we
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't seize vehicles under three
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so again it's
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
addressing issues um that that aren't
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
really there in in practicality so those
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
are some of the highlights i'm happy i
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
know we have limited time to answer
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions and i and i hope there would
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
be some questions either here or a
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
future date about how the process
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually works and we have the
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity in depth to describe that to
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
you um but i understand you're pressed
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
for time as well so i've tried to keep
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
it short anyway which is not easy for us
 
02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:14.870 align:start position:0%
it short anyway which is not easy for us
lawyers

02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%

02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%

that we
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative irene you had a question
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%

02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay very good um further questions we

02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls ross connolly
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee i will be very brief since i
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
too am waiting for the next bill uh
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
my name is ross connolly i'm the deputy
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
state director for americans for
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
prosperity here in new hampshire uh here
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
to voice our support for for the
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
amendment uh we also supported the
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh really the top line issue for us is
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
is the current system
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
since it goes through that civil process
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
after the criminal process
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
in that civil process uh
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
a defendant is not given representation
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh so therefore if if property was
 
02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.910 align:start position:0%
uh so therefore if if property was
seized

02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
seized
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
of a certain amount that it may not be
 
02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
of a certain amount that it may not be
worth

02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
worth
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
somebody actually challenging that and
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get their property back
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
since the legal fees might exceed the
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
property that they're trying to to get
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
back so we we consider this this step
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
obviously there's some technical issues
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
that uh the committee has to work
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
through and we'd be happy to provide
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
advice on that as well uh but we view
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
this as a good protection of property
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
rights uh creating a more efficient
 
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.270 align:start position:0%
rights uh creating a more efficient
system

02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh protecting granite stater's
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
right to due process especially if they
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
are acquitted so uh with that i'd be
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
 
02:05:04.079 --> 02:05:07.510 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
any

02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you for your
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls frank nack aclu
 
02:05:14.719 --> 02:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls frank nack aclu
nh

02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
my colleague lee covered most of the
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
issues um about why we uh strongly
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
support hb 1296. um i appreciate just
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
hearing from the ag's office that they
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
have you know guidelines in place i
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be prudent on the
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
committee to think just back a couple of
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
years at the federal level under holder
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
they put under guidelines to restrict
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
abuses under the equitable sharing
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
program a couple years later then
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
attorney general sessions rescinded part
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
of those guidelines and so
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have good guidelines in
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
place now i don't think should
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
should um
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
detract from the fact that we need
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
strong laws in place to protect property
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
owners in new hampshire
 
02:06:08.159 --> 02:06:09.109 align:start position:0%
owners in new hampshire
um

02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
i think one issue that hasn't been
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
touched on that and i know we're short
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
on time is just you know this the notion
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
of what forfeiture is about you know
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
forfeiture was sold to the public as
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
this tool for getting the ill-gotten
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
gains of drug kingpins think pablo
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
escobar think you know the cartels
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
in reality the way it has been deployed
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and across the country
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
is to target
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
low-level low-income people some of whom
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
have not been involved in any criminal
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
action so fortunately new hampshire took
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
some positive steps back in 2016 to
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
require a criminal conviction
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
but then again in this process we have
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
now as as my colleague ross just noted
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
folks who are then
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
found guilty if their property has no
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
nexus and they are indigent they can't
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney to then prove that
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
their property has no nexus and so
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot i heard a lot of talk
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
about burdens on the system i think you
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
know we should all think about where
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
that burden should really lie if the
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
government is attempting to take the
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
property of someone
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
just because there's some problems with
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
the government's ability to hire enough
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
people that shouldn't fall on property
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
owners to have to handle and that we
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to as a government ensure
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
that we have the checks and balances in
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that innocent property
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
owners and people who have no nexus
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
between the crime and the property
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
all right represent me i didn't see you
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
back there go ahead
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
one quick question there seems to be a
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
disconnect between what you're saying
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
and what the attorney general's office
 
02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:46.709 align:start position:0%
and what the attorney general's office
said

02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
um just to recap quickly they said that
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a problem in new hampshire
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
this is not happening
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it is
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a serious enough problem that
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
we should be uh we should be passing
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um
 
02:08:02.639 --> 02:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um
where

02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
is your information coming from
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh and and can you quantify the level of
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
the problem in new hampshire
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely so unfortunately the ag the
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
as as uh mr mcgrath noted the reporting
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been conducted so we actually
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't have data in new hampshire we do
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
know from numerous articles and
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
stories that have been reported on that
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
led to you know the the forfeiture
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
reforms back in 2016 that new hampshire
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
has had a pattern of forfeiture abuses
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
and so you know we would appreciate that
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
the state would then come forward with
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
records of what's happening on the
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
ground now but you know i've worked on
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
this issue in a number of states the
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
patterns have been consistent that
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
forfeitures are abused and that we need
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
to have these laws in place and this is
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
just the latest iteration of
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process you know
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
we are ensuring that the process that
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have the judge
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
retrained on the facts that the council
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
or not have to be retrained on the facts
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
by having a streamlined process you know
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
i understood that there's somehow create
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
confusion but when you think about it
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
practically speaking you have a single
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
process where everyone is up to speed on
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
the facts of the case and that's the
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
most streamlined way we could think
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
about doing something
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
at this time i'm going to close the
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.079 --> 02:09:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.639 --> 02:09:25.629 align:start position:0%
 
hb

02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
hb
 
02:09:25.639 --> 02:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
hb

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to open the public hearing
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm liking this improvement in the
 
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.280 --> 02:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.149 align:start position:0%
i'm a state representative for hillsboro
44

02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
44
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
which is south manchester wards eight
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
and nine and the town of litchfield
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i come today to present hb 1476 fn
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it is a bill
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
addressing uh bail which you guys have
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
never talked about that here before
 
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.390 align:start position:0%
never talked about that here before
right

02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.830 align:start position:0%
right
so

02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
the issue with bail in general
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state legislator passed personal
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
recognizance bill also known as cashless
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
bail a couple of years ago
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
the intentions of the legislature at the
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
time were i think
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a noble cause that we could all get
 
02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.870 align:start position:0%
a noble cause that we could all get
behind

02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
no one wanted poor people to be held for
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
minor crimes that they may or may not
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
have convicted purely because they
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford bail i think that was
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
the intention when this legislator did
 
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
that and i think to this day that is
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
probably still the intention of this
 
02:11:08.639 --> 02:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
probably still the intention of this
body

02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
the problem is is it has grown
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
out of control in my opinion
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
i represent as i said the city of
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
manchester which has been particularly
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
affected by this issue
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is actually the reason that i ran out
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
of all of the reasons that i ran this
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
was it
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
when i went door to door as a candidate
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
i heard from the 4 500 doors that i
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
knocked i heard pr bail over and over
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
and over again
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
which surprised me that
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
the my my future constituents would be
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
that plugged into a certain problem it's
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
a level of understanding that i bluntly
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't expect from the average voter
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a more nuanced thing after all so
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
when i got to concord
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
i actually met with um
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
several stakeholders of this issue in my
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
city before i was even sworn in
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
that was still in
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say it's infancy but
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
they were there was many people that
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
were still in wait and see mode on the
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
effects of pr bail on the community and
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think um from people you'll hear with
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
today i think we've moved beyond the
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
wait and see mode and i think we're now
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the point of we need some change
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill will not fix all of the
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
problems with pr bail um
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
some of the problems include letting out
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
people who have been accused of violent
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
criminals violent crimes
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know and you guys know this from the
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on 92
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
i could sit here and i could list off
 
02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
i could sit here and i could list off
the

02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
egregious offenses that have been given
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
pr bail but i don't think that would
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
actually be productive towards the
 
02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
actually be productive towards the
conversation

02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
so the bill that i have presented is
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
tailored towards people who are already
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
out on bail so it does not affect does
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
not change
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
the current bail system for people who
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
are not currently out on bail if you are
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
not on out on bail this and you are
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
arrested this bill doesn't affect you at
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
all we are talking about people who are
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
arrested while out on bail
 
02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
arrested while out on bail
so

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
in my expiration or fact-finding mission
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholders one of the things
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
that i found is that you have a
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
group of people who are arrested again
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke with patrolmen from my
 
02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke with patrolmen from my
city

02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
they and i'd ask them about pr bail
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
they'd say some not so nice things about
 
02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
they'd say some not so nice things about
it

02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:13:30.149 --> 02:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that they refer to
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
it as is catch and release
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the problem is is there's multiple
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
instances of people being arrested
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
in my city of manchester who are
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
released for an arrest before the police
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
officer has actually finished the
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork for arresting them
 
02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.109 align:start position:0%
paperwork for arresting them
and

02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
i am one of the largest advocators for
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
civil liberties and individual rights
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
but at a certain point
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
policy and philosophy don't always match
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe that if you are out on
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
bail and you have been arrested we need
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
to take a closer look at you
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
and i understand the arguments they
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
haven't been convicted of the first
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
crime maybe this is the second arrest
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they're innocent of both it's a fair
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
point to make and you're not wrong to
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
raise that point i won't refute that
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
but what i will say is is we should
 
02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
but what i will say is is we should
exercise

02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
some some state interest and take a
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
closer look at you so what this bill
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
does is if you are arrested while out on
 
02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.270 align:start position:0%
does is if you are arrested while out on
bail

02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
bail
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
you cannot go in front of a bail
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner you will go in front of a
 
02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner you will go in front of a
judge

02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i did that for a couple of reasons
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
when i met with
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
people in the beginning a lot of finger
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
pointing was pointed at the bail
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
commissioners and i know that this body
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that helped fund them and
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
helped kind of
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
bolster them up so that they can better
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
do their job and better be funded for
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
their job
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
but one of the reasons i wanted to go
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
i wanted to have them go in front of the
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
judge was because let's say and i do not
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
believe this but let's just say for the
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
sake of the argument the other side is
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
right that this individual is being
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
targeted by the police once again i
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't hold this viewpoint but let's just
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
say you're right wouldn't we want that
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
person to go in front of a judge and say
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
hey i'm being targeted by the police
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
what can you do for me a bail
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner can do nothing for them
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
but a judge can do something so i put
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
them in front of the judge
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing is it does is it puts
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
the power back into the judge's hands
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
they cannot give pr bail
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
for a second arrest
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
they can set that bail at a penny it
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to me but they're not
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
going to get pr bail
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that is the that is the intent of
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
this bill i did send a amendment to the
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
chair yesterday morning um because
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's a 72 hour hold provision and i
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
was told that that's not um legally
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
allowed so i did have i did have a
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to shift that 72-hour hold
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
down to a 36-hour hold which i was told
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
is in line with the current
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements um and
 
02:15:58.239 --> 02:15:59.350 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements um and
obviously

02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
as with all bail it doesn't apply to
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
weekends and nights and that sort of
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
thing but that's that's standard
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
operating procedure at this point so
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to answer the
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
questions to the best of my ability um
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
but that that is what the my intent was
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and i did i will say one other
 
02:16:13.199 --> 02:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
and uh and i did i will say one other
thing

02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan bill
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
um i actually went out of my way um to
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
find uh almost equal balance to it um
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i i'm i believe some of them are
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
some of the my friends on the other side
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the aisle are here to testify but i i
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
am here today to advocate for my
 
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
am here today to advocate for my
community

02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.429 align:start position:0%
community
manchester

02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
needs this
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
we need this it doesn't undermine this
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee's original intention of
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
but i am asking you to take a holistic
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
holistic view of this for people that
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
are already out on bail and when we
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
arrest them again we need to figure out
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you mr
 
02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
02:17:02.479 --> 02:17:04.549 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
question

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
bill reminds me of something we've heard
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
before with uh with some interesting
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
differences but
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has come up
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the discussion around efforts to
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
reform this is
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that people who uh could
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
potentially be held
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
for crimes that would not
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
require them to be held
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
at all under the current system um
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
essentially very minor offenses and i'd
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
like you i'm wondering if you'd address
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
that point yeah so it's it's a it's a
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
fair point i mean if you arrest you can
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
that original argument is still is still
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
there right they can be arrested for
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
this crime to begin with right they can
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
go to jail um and they can be held so
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's in the hands of the
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
committee to address those minor crimes
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
if you will um i one of the complaints
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
about 92 was that it got into the
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
business of listing crimes
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
which i know that gave this committee
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
some consternation and i believe some
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
representatives on the floor so i i
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
tried to avoid that
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's admitted it's admittedly be by
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
avoiding that you cast a a wider net or
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
a broader stroke um but it is something
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the committee should look at um but
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
the underlying point is still there you
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
can still be arrested for that crime
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you can't be held for to begin with
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
and once again we're not talking about
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
holding them indefinitely we're talking
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
about 36 hours they have to go before a
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
judge and they just can't get pr bail
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but i think that then answer that
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
question to your satisfaction
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
follow it does um
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about the the underlying
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
thought behind this and you addressed a
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
very real problem in your city that is
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh happening in mind on a smaller scale
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
is this intended to
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
deterrence is that real the factor here
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
or is this or is deterrence only part of
 
02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.150 align:start position:0%
or is this or is deterrence only part of
it

02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
so it i deterrence is a is a factor at
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
it i speaking with the patrolmen
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
specifically in my city they've told me
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
stories about when they've arrested
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
people who are in the as they say once
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
again this is hearsay but they say
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
they're in the back of the squad car
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
laughing at them because they know
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be back out on the
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
streets before the paperwork's done
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
so i believe that if they know that they
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
won't be back out on the street before
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
the paperwork's done that they might be
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
a little more um
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do the things that they're
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
being accused of doing um but it's a
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
once again i think this is a balanced
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
approach to
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
once again the underlying purpose of pr
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
bail which is don't hold
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
indigent people who aren't capable of
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
paying for bail for crimes for minor
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
crimes they might not have committed
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
i think this still lives in that spirit
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
but at a certain point we as a society
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to step up and say what's going on
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
here and that's that's the purpose of
 
02:19:49.600 --> 02:20:05.910 align:start position:0%
here and that's that's the purpose of
this

02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have my name tag today
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.790 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
um

02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
i was wondering do you know of any law
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
or policy
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
which has historically tied the length
 
02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
which has historically tied the length
of

02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
time that someone's
 
02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
time that someone's
held

02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
held
 
02:20:26.399 --> 02:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
held
pre-trial

02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
pre-trial
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the length of time that
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't fully understand the
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
may i clarify yes i'm sorry um let me
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
try to find another way to word it
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
you've um you've made many uh comments
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
in your presentation
 
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
in your presentation
tying

02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
the length of time that a that an
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
administrative person needs to complete
 
02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
administrative person needs to complete
paperwork

02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
to the length of time that someone
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
should be in jail
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
pre-trial and i was wondering
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
tell us about any law or policy which
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
has historically connected those two
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
things i think you're misunderstanding
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
the point um so there's no
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
min there's no minimum that they have to
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
be held
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
it just says they have to go in front of
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
a judge and they can't get pr bail and
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
you cannot hold them longer than 36
 
02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
you cannot hold them longer than 36
hours

02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
if if you take someone in and they're in
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
front of a judge in 10 minutes and their
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
the judge says you know here's your one
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
dollar bail and you're back out before
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the paperwork's completed that's under
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
36 hours that's perfectly legal
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not constraining it's
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
not saying if you're arrested we're
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to hold you for 36 hours it says
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
we can hold you for up to 36 hours while
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
we do our job and that job is now
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
including going in front of the judge
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason why you have to do that
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
is obviously if you're shifting people
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
away from a bail commissioner bill
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners were established to
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically relieve the do leave the
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
pressures on judges right if you're
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
shifting them into this system that is
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
already more congested you need more
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
time but if the system is
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know running at a hundred percent
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
and they're in and out in five minutes
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
with the two dollar bail
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's a thing that can happen
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
sorry i think that maybe my original
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
question still isn't clear
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
you've indicated or at least i've
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
received the impression from your
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that you feel that someone who
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
um is
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
being held
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
they haven't been tried they're legally
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
innocent they've been arrested it's time
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
for them to be released so that they can
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
go about their lives until trial
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
you've i've gotten the impression that
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
you believe that they should be held
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
until at least the length of time that
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
the paperwork uh that would be necessary
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
to complete paperwork
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
is that that that was not is that what
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
you you know intended to communicate no
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
my my point is is that we need to we
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
need to put them in front of the
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate authority in my opinion
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's the judge
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have a sinking suspicion that that
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
will take longer than just filling out
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and going in front of a
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that um i don't work in
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
the court system but i think a logical
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative panalakas
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this bill is just
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
referring to the second offense right
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that's while they're out on bail and
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
arrested again so it's it's not first
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
offense it's underneath the current
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
system and as i said in my testimony
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
in my
 
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
fact-finding in concord i did not
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the votes existed to go at
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
the underlying problem i've spoken about
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
my issues with pr bail as a whole
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a policy that i would have
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
supported but i wasn't here and at the
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
end of the day we're all one of 400 and
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
our votes are all the same and i thought
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
that this was a measured approach that
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
both sides could kind of look at and say
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay if you are out on that second if
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're out on bail and we arrest you
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
again maybe we should get you in front
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the judge
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is if you haven't
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
learned your lesson the first time we're
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to take care of you the second
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
time well i i
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's we're going to hold we're going to
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
take a better look at you i mean
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
remember they're not adjudicated on the
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
first crime that's right and it's and i
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
i said in the beginning it's a fair
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
point to make you have not been
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
you have not been found guilty of the
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
first arrest um but i do think the state
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
has a compelling interest to take a
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
better look at you um
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
going back to it
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
for all i know this gets them through
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
the system faster
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the complaints that i heard
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders was that the bail
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners don't do their job
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bill when you speak with the bill
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
commissioners they say they're operating
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
under instructions from the judges
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the judges can be held
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
accountable they have internal review
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
internal review boards um i i don't
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
believe in you know they are a co-equal
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
branch of government to us and they do
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
have accountability measures within
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
their own body and i think that they
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
need to be held to that versus saying oh
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
well that's just what the bail
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:25:21.439 --> 02:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
02:25:24.399 --> 02:25:25.349 align:start position:0%
i understand
uh

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the problems people feel we have
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
with pr veil
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
a person losing their freedom
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh because we feel that they've got
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
problems with pr bail
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
about people being released again and
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
don't you feel if somebody's being
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
released again and again and again
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
that probably has nothing to do with pr
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
bail but that's a problem with the
 
02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
bail but that's a problem with the
courts

02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
courts
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's my personal that's my personal
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
opinion once again representative and mr
 
02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:09.510 align:start position:0%
opinion once again representative and mr
chairman

02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there's the will of
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
the body of concord unfortunately to
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
address what i think is the underlying
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
problem so i'm trying to find a middle
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
ground forward for these for these
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
repeat most likely repeat offenders now
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
once again they have not been
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated guilty i acknowledge that in
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
my opening testimony
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to sit up here for all
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
i know when they've been arrested six
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
times they're innocent six times that's
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
the standard that innocent until proven
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
guilty hol is we hold to but we do know
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
that there are compelling state
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
interests and i'm trying to
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
assert that interest and fight for the
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
community who is affected by the
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
repeated release of sometimes violent
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
criminals but um many times they're not
 
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
many times it's you know burglary or um
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know vandalism
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
but it's if you're if you're already out
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
on bail in my opinion you should
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
probably be on good behavior
 
02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:04.550 align:start position:0%
probably be on good behavior
um

02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.670 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes you're not and
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the representative's point from dover
 
02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:12.550 align:start position:0%
to the representative's point from dover
um

02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree that if the second crime
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve a jail sentence there
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
should be an exception for that
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
no because they're
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're still arresting them they're still
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to booking they're still going
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
through that they're just going through
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
a slightly different process so if you
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
can be arrested
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
let's say it's the first arrest right
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
for whatever this crime is that has no
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
no no no possibility of jail time right
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can still be arrested and still go
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
through it um they can still go through
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
get pr bail they're still they're still
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
being taken to jail
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
second arrest we're still taking them to
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
jail we're just putting them through a
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
slightly different process which i
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
believe is at a higher it's set to a
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
higher standard
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
i just like some clarification on the
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
number of hours that we've talked about
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
detainment i
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard 36 hours
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
and i look at line seven in the in the
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill as i got it off the table there
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
that says they shall be detained for a
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
period of not more than 72 hours
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
correct so i sent uh some kind of
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty with that i will give you the
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
amendment number that i sent chairman
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
abbas uh it is amendment uh
 
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
abbas uh it is amendment uh
uh

02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.469 align:start position:0%
uh
2022-05898

02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
if i had not had left my computer in
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
manchester today i would have had
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
printed copies for you um but it
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
replaces all references to 36 of two of
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
72 hours to 36 hours thank you
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the chairman has that amendment and
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would highly if you do
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
if the committee sees fit to pass this
 
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
if the committee sees fit to pass this
bill

02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
you must pass that amendment otherwise
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
it will not withstand constitutional
 
02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.389 align:start position:0%
it will not withstand constitutional
muster

02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
muster
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
and to be clear by chairman they mean
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
the one who's not here and that's me the
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
other one is the other chairman because
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
for testimony thank you so much the
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
for the record only since i i know
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard this already my name is
 
02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
buzz sher i'm a police commissioner in
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
portsmouth unh law professor
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the opinions i expressed today are my
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
own and not those of either unh law unh
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
first um i
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
i apologize for what i'm about to say in
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
in some ways but it is
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
bothered me deeply
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh over the last four years you know uh
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
i've been involved since the beginning
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
in bail reform
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
i authored the bail reform bill that was
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
presented by
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
senator feltus three or four years ago
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm very familiar with this area it
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
is offensive
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
for anyone to talk about the problem
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
here as catch and release
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the people that we're talking about are
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
human beings many of whom have mental
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
illness problems many of whom have
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
substance abuse problems many of whom
 
02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
substance abuse problems many of whom
are

02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
are homeless they are not fish
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the term
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
catch and release treats them like that
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
so i would ask everybody who testifies
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and on this committee to uh please do
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
not use the term catch and release it is
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
immensely disrespectful
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
so let me clear up
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh a number of myths that uh
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
related to bail reform the original bail
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
reform bill was not a pr bail not a
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bill
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that that dealt with two
 
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:11.750 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that that dealt with two
problems

02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
one the fact that judges were holding
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
people without effectively without bail
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
poor people effectively without bail by
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
setting bail at a hundred dollars or
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars or two hundred dollars
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
with no attention whatsoever to whether
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
they could meet that amount and
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the original bill got rid of that
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
practice and basically said
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you can prove somebody is dangerous
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
or if you can prove they are a risk of
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
fleeing you can hold them without bail
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
and it expanded the number of crimes for
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
which mis class a misdemeanors and
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
felonies for which you could hold people
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
without bail and we got rid of the
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
artifice the the false idea of using
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
setting bail as a way to hold people and
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
we got rid of people being held on minor
 
02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:08.150 align:start position:0%
we got rid of people being held on minor
crimes

02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
on a hundred dollars bail because they
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
were poor that's what the bill was it
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't a pr bail bill so i disagree with
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
the ongoing reference to the original
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
bail or form as pr bail bill it
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
resulted in as one superintendent said
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
at the first of the two bail commissions
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
that followed
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
it resulted not only in poor dangerous
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
people being held it also resulted in
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
rich dangerous people being held which
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
was a change from the pre-bail reform
 
02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.710 align:start position:0%
was a change from the pre-bail reform
act

02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
act
um

02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
um
number

02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
i've got my numbers now and i've lost my
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
numbers there we go
 
02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
numbers there we go
um

02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's this misunderstanding there's
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
this myth that we're doing nothing under
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
to hold people who to to pay attention
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
to people who have
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
been arrested on one charge and then
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
while on pr bail are arrested on another
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
charge the current bail reform statute
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
consistently from its first iteration
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago through the the
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
practices recommended by the first veil
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
commission adopted by this legislature
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
through the practices recommended by the
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
second bail commission
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and adopted by the legislature both
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
bail commissions which had
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
a majority of law enforcement on the
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
commissions including individuals from
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
the manchester police department
 
02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
the manchester police department
um

02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
there are provisions in the current bail
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
bill to deal differently with people who
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
are repeat
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:50.389 align:start position:0%
are repeat
arrestees

02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
arrestees
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's not like this is oh here's a great
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
new idea let's deal with people who are
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
repeat arrestees there are provisions in
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
there measured provisions dealt with
 
02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:02.389 align:start position:0%
there measured provisions dealt with
through

02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
consultation with all the stakeholders
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders includes not just
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
members of the manchester police
 
02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:12.230 align:start position:0%
members of the manchester police
department

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
not just members of prosecutorial
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
authorities but it includes defense
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh it include and includes civil
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
libertarians it includes bail
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners uh it includes legislators
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the bail commissions were
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
about this is yet another bill coming
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
before this body that is a one
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder bill this is a
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill from
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
that it serves the interest of the
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
manchester police department there are
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
different interests at other police
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
departments it's not the case that every
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
police department uh would be in support
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh regardless of what the
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
police chiefs would say
 
02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
police chiefs would say
number

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
four it's uh
 
02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
four it's uh
it's

02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
really important that
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
the people were
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
talking about here are the mentally ill
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
those with substance abuse issues and
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
homeless people
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
the huge majority of people who are
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
arrested for a violent felony the first
 
02:35:19.439 --> 02:35:20.389 align:start position:0%
arrested for a violent felony the first
time

02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
and if if in fact they are released
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
which isn't normally the case if in fact
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
they are not held without bail and
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
arrested for another violent felony
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be held
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
now i'm sure you'll hear a parade of
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotes that says differently but
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're just anecdotes and some of those
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
anecdotes are predate the changes that
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
the first and second bail commissions
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
made so what we're talking about is
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
people charged with minor offenses who
 
02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:52.469 align:start position:0%
people charged with minor offenses who
are

02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
to to to use a colloquial term a pain in
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
the neck
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know they're not committing serious
 
02:36:00.319 --> 02:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
you know they're not committing serious
crimes

02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're on the fringes of the criminal
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're likely uh homeless they're
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
either homeless or they have substance
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
abuse issues
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
or they have mental health issues
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
this is yet another effort to solve
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
the societal problems of substance abuse
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
mental illness and homelessness using
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system and it
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
putting somebody in jail because they're
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
a repeat misdemeanor low-level
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offender and they're
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
is a bad thing it's not they don't get
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of treatment they need in jail
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
jail is not a healthy thing for someone
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
who's mentally ill
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
or homeless
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
or has a substance abuse problem
 
02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:50.950 align:start position:0%
or has a substance abuse problem
so

02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is much more of deals
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
that changes this make
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
don't improve whether violent second
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
arrestees are held
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
it makes it much more likely that
 
02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
somebody charged with a class b
 
02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
somebody charged with a class b
misdemeanor

02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know a minor a shoplifting of some
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
a mother who keeps shoplifting to get
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
diapers for her kids or that kind of
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
crime that's what this is targeted at
 
02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:26.550 align:start position:0%
crime that's what this is targeted at
um

02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
deterrence in
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
arresting someone not having them go in
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
front of a bail commissioner
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
them having them go in front of a judge
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
and being released 36 to
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know 96 hours later
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
depending on whether they're arrested on
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
a saturday friday or saturday
 
02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:49.429 align:start position:0%
a saturday friday or saturday
um

02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know the people who are committing
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
these crimes
 
02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
these crimes
this

02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
get out of your minds if it's there this
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
idea that these are these people who are
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
horrible criminals
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know the huge majority of people
 
02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
you know the huge majority of people
committing

02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
committing
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
minor crisis misdemeanors and class b
 
02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
minor crisis misdemeanors and class b
misdemeanors

02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
are people who are really struggling in
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
their lives and this bill
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
wants to get them sweep them off the
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
street and put them in jail pre-trial
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
rather than use
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms for dealing with it and
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
some of the frustration but it's the
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
wrong way to deal with it
 
02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:33.349 align:start position:0%
wrong way to deal with it
uh

02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
i know at least one other person will
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
talk about
uh

02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
the data that's out there but briefly
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
when bail from the time bail reform was
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
not in effect
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
to a year or so year to two after it
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
went into effect
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
let's be careful
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
in buying into these stories that things
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
are out of control in manchester they
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
are not out of control in manchester
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
the manchester police department does an
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
excellent job
 
02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
excellent job
and

02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
we don't i i don't have a copy of the
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it may be coming but
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
i've heard testimony i think i heard
 
02:39:34.469 --> 02:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
testimony that said that they it would
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh keep people from being able to see a
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
and

02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
just for my benefit could you kind of uh
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
talk about what kind of impact that has
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
on the people that you have not having
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
ability to have access to a bail
 
02:39:49.359 --> 02:39:50.710 align:start position:0%
ability to have access to a bail
commissioner

02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
it keeps them in
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
just just to set the scene when somebody
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
is arrested
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
they usually they now they go in front
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
of a bail commission
 
02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:03.910 align:start position:0%
of a bail commission
commissioner

02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the bail commissioner listens to
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
what the police officer has to say
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's no defense lawyer there they go
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
in front of uh they
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
they listen to what the police officer
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
has to say and if the individual has
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
anything to say they'll listen to them
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
then they set bail
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
then if they're held
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
then an arraignment is scheduled if
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're held by the by the bail the
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
police commissioner sets then they see a
 
02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:30.389 align:start position:0%
police commissioner sets then they see a
judge

02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
usually within a day or so
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill takes that bail commissioner
 
02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:38.150 align:start position:0%
this bill takes that bail commissioner
step

02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
out of the mix so they they get no
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
initial screening of whether they
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
deserve bail or not they wait until they
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
get to see a judge and and that you know
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
that creates an a a large number of
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
extra hearings uh for the court system
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
and and uh of inc significantly
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
increased costs which i believe another
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
witness will talk about
 
02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:02.950 align:start position:0%
witness will talk about
you

02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
it just showed up the amendment have you
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
seen it i have not
 
02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
what's that i have not oh okay i just
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what your opinion was my
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that instead of 72
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
hours it's 36 hours
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
is that what the amendment says
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
i just got it follow up
 
02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
i just got it follow up
okay

02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
so uh you
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
know the problem is if you're arrested
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
on friday afternoon after the
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a judge available
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
you're held
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
24 hours to saturday 48 hours till
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
sunday and then there's 36 more hours
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
another day and a half so you might not
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
get a hearing until sometime on tuesday
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
even if you were arrested on friday
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think that's still an
 
02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.070 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think that's still an
issue

02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh it puts it
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then it also puts because of the
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of hearings that
 
02:42:03.429 --> 02:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
are going to be required
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
it puts the courts uh certainly the
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
monday and tuesday docket of circuit
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
courts and superior courts
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
under a lot of stress to handle
 
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
everybody held over the weekend within
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
the 36 hours period starting on monday
 
02:42:18.479 --> 02:42:19.590 align:start position:0%
the 36 hours period starting on monday
morning

02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
for a hearing
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is one of the problems that
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
sb 92 that made it to the house floor
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
had it you know it increased the cost to
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
courts by millions of dollars man and
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has that same problem
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative panalakas
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:45.429 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
professor

02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
professor
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
with all the problems we've had with the
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
bail bill
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh from the seacoast
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the north country
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
we just not clarify the law a little bit
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:42:59.190 --> 02:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
this one bill
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
this won't improve the problems that are
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:03.429 align:start position:0%
out there
um

02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:10.630 align:start position:0%
i think we
oversize

02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
oversize
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
the degree to which we hear that there
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
are problems
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
based on the bail reform act you know
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
crime rights around the straight state
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
not only in manchester are going down
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think what needs to happen is we need
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
to gather all the stakeholders together
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
and not have yet another bill from
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
the police chiefs or from one police
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
department and we need to gather all the
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together like we've done
 
02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:39.429 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together like we've done
before

02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem a complicated
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
problem it intersects with social
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
services uh it intersects with any
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
issues and to deal with this on a once
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
one stakeholder basis i think is the
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
wrong way to do it i freely acknowledge
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system has got
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
significant issues to deal with and
 
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
would love to participate in any any
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive effort multi-stakeholder
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
effort to deal with them but this
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that it's it's trying to
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
fix something that actually doesn't need
 
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
fix something that actually doesn't need
fixing

02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
fixing
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
this does not just pertain
 
02:44:27.990 --> 02:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
to me and chester i agree i have had
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
heard these complaints
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
from seabrook clear up in the north
 
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
from seabrook clear up in the north
country

02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we've had two
 
02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:37.830 align:start position:0%
and we've had two
commissions

02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and they have not resolved this
 
02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
meeting and they have not resolved this
problem

02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:42.550 align:start position:0%
problem
so

02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this law just classify it uh i
 
02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:47.349 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this law just classify it uh i
don't

02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully uh representative
 
02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully uh representative
penalakis

02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
penalakis
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
it it it's a it's using a sledgehammer
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
to try and kill
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
something that's closer in size to a
 
02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
something that's closer in size to a
mosquito

02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
mosquito
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh than you know
 
02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh something other than bigger than that
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh i agree there's a problem
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
but one stakeholder solutions are not
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
work are not the way to try and solve
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
the problem because the criminal justice
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
represent muse
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question one of
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
the things that we hear about
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotally and this is in portsmouth
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
and manchester and i think a lot of
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
other communities is
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
the the frustration that police have
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
with dealing with folks who are
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
shoplifters and a lot of times there are
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
gangs that come in from out of state and
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
cars and things like that
 
02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
cars and things like that
um

02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some real logistical
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
issues around
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
being able to hold people for crimes
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
like that so i i guess what i would ask
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
you is is there
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
is there a middle ground that's not in
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe we should be looking at yeah
 
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
there may be um i i
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
i recognize that problem practically
 
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
speaking uh if it's a
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote shoplifting uh gang um if
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're released once on pr bail
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
they're not coming back to the state
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
so i i think this bill doesn't deal with
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
or if it does it's already dealt with in
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the bill as it exists that has
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
repeat arrestees provisions in it so you
 
02:46:31.269 --> 02:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
know i think there uh
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
i think there may be
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
other ways of making a dent in that
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
problem i i don't think they're easy
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
answers but again i think we need a
 
02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:45.110 align:start position:0%
answers but again i think we need a
multi-stakeholder

02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholder
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh problem solving group to do that
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
one stakeholder
 
02:46:51.279 --> 02:46:55.030 align:start position:0%
one stakeholder
solving

02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
isn't there a
 
02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:06.469 align:start position:0%
isn't there a
purpose

02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the police department
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
to keep the citizens
 
02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:12.469 align:start position:0%
to keep the citizens
safe

02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:47:12.479 --> 02:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
safe
sane

02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
sane
 
02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:14.630 align:start position:0%
sane
and

02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and feeling comfortable i hate to say
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
just feeling comfortable
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the kinds of crimes that we're
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
or you talk about the shoplifting that
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
really aren't
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
if you get a lot of people shoplifting i
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
don't feel safe going into a shop
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of respect and a
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount of
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
of you know ability to to go about my
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
business yeah
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't doesn't this
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know this would stop some of the the
 
02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:50.630 align:start position:0%
you know this would stop some of the the
second

02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
or third time this person
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
did that i mean
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
i i i know you're you're you're enamored
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
with this commission you were part of
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
and they did a wonderful job but it
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
isn't working
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
i um
 
02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
i recognized your concern for safety and
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
go into stores without fear of getting
 
02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the way of shoplifters
 
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
but shoplifting hasn't because of bail
 
02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
but shoplifting hasn't because of bail
reform

02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
reform
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
shoplifting hasn't skyrocketed anywhere
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire because of bail reform
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
this has been an enduring problem that
 
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
we continue to struggle with
 
02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:34.550 align:start position:0%
we continue to struggle with
and

02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
i want solutions to this but i want good
 
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
solutions not just facial solutions that
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
seem to sound good i have to say you
 
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
look around the country
 
02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
you look at those jurisdictions where
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's been bail reform
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
and every single police department
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact and almost new
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
york city is a good example that bail
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
reform went into effect in new york city
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
the crime rate new york city has gone
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
down 98 percent of the people who were
 
02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
released under the bail reform act in
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that involved new york city and new york
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
state 98 of them did not commit another
 
02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:18.150 align:start position:0%
state 98 of them did not commit another
crime

02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
crime
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:49:20.319 --> 02:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
so um
there's

02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is issues where
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
we need to balance
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
civil liberties we need to
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
balance the desire of the police
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
to sol to to deal with
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh citizens concerns with public safety
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of complicated
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
issues um you know i
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
i didn't get
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
virtually anything
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
i was interested in getting out of the
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
second bell commission
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh i'm enamored of the process i'm not
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily i was not necessarily
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
enamored of the result but it's a better
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
we always screw up when we let one
 
02:50:05.590 --> 02:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholder decide the way we're going
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you
 
02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls the honorable
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is victoria sullivan
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i reside in manchester new hampshire
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i am afraid that my testimony is
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
going to further anger the gentleman who
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
preceded me
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
just six days after being released on pr
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
bail amari diol was arrested for
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
allegedly raping a woman for two hours
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
at the valley street cemetery deol has a
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
criminal record dating back to 2011. i
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
do not believe that being raped in the
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
cemetery for two hours is anecdotal
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
enrique castro hit a child in the back
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
of the head and threatened to hit
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
another with a hammer despite having
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
numerous interactions with the
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
manchester police department castro was
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
released on pr bail
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
most recently just this week tanisha
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
ozuno allegedly went to a residence on
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
somerville street to talk about the
 
02:51:08.230 --> 02:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
involvement of her significant other
 
02:51:09.750 --> 02:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
with another woman
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
evidence presented indicates that the
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
victim was attacked with some form of
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
weapon while she was holding a young
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
child although the child was not injured
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
the victim required emergency treatment
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
to close a significant wound a zuma was
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
released on personal recognizance bail
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
with several stipulations including
 
02:51:28.469 --> 02:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
having a
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
curfew and having her firearms removed
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
from her address i ask you if this
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
person was not viewed as a threat why
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
were there so many stipulations
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
surrounding her release
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
in 2018 then senate
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
then state senator dan feltes was the
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of senate bill 556 which
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
changed the bail laws to allow for any
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
person claiming they were indigent to be
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
released on their own personal
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
recognizance this created a system
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
whereby people were released with no
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
known address no financial reason to
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
appear in court no responsibility for
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
their alleged actions
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
this in turn did in fact create a catch
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
and release program which has resulted
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
in repeat offenders going on to commit
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
violent acts let me be clear
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
no person should be held simply because
 
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
they are too impoverished to pay their
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill all people are innocent until
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
proven guilty however there is a clear
 
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
pattern of systemic abuse of this bail
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
reform which is endangering our
 
02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:25.830 align:start position:0%
reform which is endangering our
citizenry

02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
this has been a frustration for police
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
departments around the state who work to
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
get gender dangerous people off the
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
streets only to see them released within
 
02:52:33.279 --> 02:52:34.309 align:start position:0%
streets only to see them released within
hours

02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of serving with many of
 
02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:37.110 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of serving with many of
you

02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
my voting record supports the fact that
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
i am a liberty minded person i believe
 
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
in bill reform but i also believe in
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
consequences for actions
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
come spend some time in manchester and
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
you can see the direct impact to our
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
community when people are let out on pr
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill they often do not appear back in
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
court because they have nothing on the
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
line they end up hiding in our growing
 
02:52:58.790 --> 02:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
encampments and go on to commit
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
additional crimes increasing the crime
 
02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
in our streets
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
my liberty liberty is being stripped as
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
a consequence of this bill my neighbor's
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
liberties are being stripped as a
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
consequence of this bill and is
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting our downtown
 
02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:14.790 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting our downtown
businesses

02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
businesses
our

02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement officers are using
 
02:53:19.830 --> 02:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
resources on repeat offenders that we
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
need elsewhere
 
02:53:22.950 --> 02:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
now there was a comment saying that this
 
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
impacts manchester and maybe some of the
 
02:53:26.309 --> 02:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
other cities well first of all
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
manchester is the largest city in the
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
state so it's going to be impacted more
 
02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
at a greater rate however
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
we have a court in our city when people
 
02:53:36.870 --> 02:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
show up for their court date they come
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
to manchester when they're released on
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
pr bail they end up in our streets so it
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
does have a significant impact on our
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
city that you won't see in towns that
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a courtroom so i ask you to
 
02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
please support
 
02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:52.070 align:start position:0%
please support
hb1476

02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
hb1476
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
amended to give our city some relief we
 
02:53:56.469 --> 02:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
cannot carry the burden of the entire
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
state we can't and our officers are
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
working out there every day fighting the
 
02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic fighting the crimes in
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
the street trying to help the homeless
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
and we are not doing it without a heart
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
as as has been sort of um
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
referred to here we don't say catch and
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
release because we are heartless people
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
we have resources for people and we try
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
to help them but there is a line between
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
helping people and hurting our citizenry
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we have crossed that line and we
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the witness thank you for your
 
02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:31.990 align:start position:0%
and the witness thank you for your
testimony

02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is ross
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
connolly i'm the deputy state director
 
02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
for americans for prosperity here in new
 
02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and uh this will be a bill
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
that the two rosses diverge on
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
we are in strong opposition to hb4 1476
 
02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
as it is currently written
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh the way we view this is uh really
 
02:55:05.830 --> 02:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's been multiple iterations now
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh that this committee and and others
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
have gone through uh with trying to to
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
address issues when it comes to bail
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
reform in new hampshire we view this
 
02:55:20.309 --> 02:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill to be the most
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
threatening to the
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
due process rights of granite staters it
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
puts every defendant in one size fits
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
all boxes
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
it has no discretion to to the uh the
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
type of crime uh the seriousness of the
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
crime and and we view that as as uh a
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
mistake i i will point out that we we
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
did provide the sponsors of this bill
 
02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
with suggested language uh that we would
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
be totally comfortable with it addressed
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
violent crime uh uh re-offenses and and
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
especially the the issue in manchester
 
02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
of continually uh some folks continually
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
being charged at the same location with
 
02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
trespassing we did provide language for
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
that but unfortunately it was not
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
adopted by the sponsors we would be
 
02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
happy to send that to the committee if
 
02:56:12.630 --> 02:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
if members are interested
 
02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:14.309 align:start position:0%
if members are interested
um

02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
really i we understand the the concerns
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
the proponents of of this legislation
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
and others like it
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of the 2018 law
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh was never
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh to result in violent criminals being
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
released uh in fact in the law it
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
plainly states that if an individual is
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
suspected to be a danger to themselves
 
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
or the community they shall be held
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
our language our proposed language was
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
was to really clarify that in statute
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
and and show that these you know xyz
 
02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
violent crimes
 
02:56:55.269 --> 02:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
should not be considered for uh for for
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:01.269 align:start position:0%
 
really

02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
what we worry about is is
 
02:57:04.479 --> 02:57:05.830 align:start position:0%
what we worry about is is
misdemeanors

02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know areas of of criminal code that
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
don't actually uh
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
aren't actually a direct threat to uh to
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
the public and and
 
02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh again putting every everybody in a
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all box uh we we just
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
believe is is not the correct way to
 
02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
address some of these very targeted
 
02:57:26.950 --> 02:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
targeted issues there are a lot of
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotes they should not be happening
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh to the previous speaker's uh point
 
02:57:34.389 --> 02:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
those those anecdotes should not be
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
happening under current statute we're
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
happy to work with with uh the committee
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
to try and address those those anecdotes
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
but they they are just that they they
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
are outliers in in what's happening in
 
02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
practice uh to attorney sher's point uh
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we we urge the committee to
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
as this bill stands uh to move this bill
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate but again
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
happy to to work with the committee on
 
02:58:03.110 --> 02:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh any improvements that that you may uh
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
be looking to do and i'd be happy to
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize myself for the
 
02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
first question
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
you said you found that this was the
 
02:58:14.630 --> 02:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
most dangerous of a slate of bills that
 
02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
were addressing bail reform
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm curious it's it's it's kind
 
02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
of ironic that this bail this bill
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
actually mandates someone be able to get
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge to plead their case
 
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
which is the the nature of habeas corpus
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of our law system to put
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
them in front of a judge who has the
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
power to make decisions versus a bail
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner who's got very limited
 
02:58:44.230 --> 02:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
authority so what makes someone being
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
able to get in front of a judge so
 
02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
able to get in front of a judge so
dangerous

02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question mr
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it's because they shall be
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
held uh so so they will be held uh in
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
detention uh
 
02:58:57.910 --> 02:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
until they they see that judge and uh we
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
view that as as a threat to do process
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
rights for granite staters
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
we we just
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
we understand again
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
the going to see a judge is a good thing
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
one we have a backlog already in our
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
judicial system
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these crimes are non-violent
 
02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
crimes addressing violent crime
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
is perfectly appropriate in our mind
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
we should not be releasing people that
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
are threat to the community
 
02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:26.309 align:start position:0%
are threat to the community
however

02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
prison jail are not solutions to drug
 
02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
crime to mental illness to the previous
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
speaker's points
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
these are not solutions if anything that
 
02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes they exacerbate uh criminal
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
activity uh there's a famous george jung
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
quote that he went to
 
02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:44.790 align:start position:0%
quote that he went to
uh

02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
before he went to prison he had a
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
bachelor's in marijuana and he graduated
 
02:59:51.190 --> 02:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
with a with a doctorate in cocaine uh
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's not really the solution for every
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
single crime in treating every single
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
second offense in this one-size-fits-all
 
02:59:58.560 --> 02:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
second offense in this one-size-fits-all
box

02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
box
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yes i wonder if i
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
could ask you in your view if somebody
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody commits a shoplifting and
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
they get arrested and they get released
 
03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
on bail and the next day they commit
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
another shoplifting maybe at the same
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
place maybe at another business and they
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
get arrested and they can get released
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
on bail and they do it a third time and
 
03:00:25.670 --> 03:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
a fourth time if at what point if any in
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
your view do they become a danger to the
 
03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
your view do they become a danger to the
public

03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative i i would agree that that
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
those those uh people repeat constant
 
03:00:37.030 --> 03:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders in this case
 
03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:38.550 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders in this case
shoplifting

03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
shoplifting
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
i know the sponsor had a concern about
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
trespassing that's what we
 
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
provided language for but uh i i don't
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
know of specific examples i've seen in
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
other states this happening the sort of
 
03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:49.590 align:start position:0%
other states this happening the sort of
crowd

03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
crowd
 
03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:50.790 align:start position:0%
crowd
funding

03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
of shoplifting that's happening that
 
03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
that would not be appropriate we we
 
03:00:56.950 --> 03:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
would not uh want to see those people
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
continually released uh
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
again we would be happy to provide
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
language that's that does uh
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
still protect due process but in
 
03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:09.190 align:start position:0%
still protect due process but in
specific

03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
cases of concern uh we're we're willing
 
03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee to sort of
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
address those especially when it comes
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
to shoplifting trespassing repeat
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
offenses should not uh
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
be constantly happening follow-up ask
 
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
your phone just you know you talk about
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
due process i mean i i
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
i assume you're talking about sort of
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
your view of what due process should be
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
because i haven't heard anybody
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
including professor scherer
 
03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
say that being brought before a judge
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours to have a hearing
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
somehow violates due process and i'm not
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
aware of anything that would say that
 
03:01:44.309 --> 03:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
that does violate due process
 
03:01:45.429 --> 03:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative our our big concern is
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is going backwards towards
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
criminalizing people for being poor
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
and if you just can't afford bail
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
we don't think that should be a reason
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
to hold somebody um
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the repeat offenses
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
again we're willing to to uh compromise
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
on those issues uh when it comes to due
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
process we we believe that you are
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty and and
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
that should be respected and uh
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
unless in in some of these anecdotal
 
03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:19.429 align:start position:0%
unless in in some of these anecdotal
circumstances

03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh of of of crimes
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
happening on a repeated basis uh that
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
that people shouldn't be held just
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony thank you very much
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls richard head
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair members of the
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
um as you may not be surprised i'm here
 
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about the potential impact this
 
03:02:59.429 --> 03:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
bill would have on the circuit courts
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
not so much to address the policy behind
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:03.830 align:start position:0%
this bill
the

03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
i've had multiple conversations with
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
this committee in in with regard to a
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
number of bills when senate bill 92 was
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
before you
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
the potential increase in cases in the
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court of around 3 000 cases
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
that bill by the way does exist again
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
this this session as senate bill 294
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
in in that issue is is still going to
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
probably be brought for you again what i
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't know and i can't tell you is how
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
many cases this covers because we we
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
sort of know how many of the
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that that would be
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
at issue under under the senate bill 92
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
scenario what we don't track is how many
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
times somebody is rearrested because we
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't really know that we don't have
 
03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
that data it doesn't come to us so i
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
can't tell you you know this will result
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
in x number of additional hearings
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
before a circuit court judge
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
but what i what i do know is the scope
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is all felonies all
 
03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
of the bill which is all felonies all
misdemeanors

03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
class a misdemeanors class b
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors all felonies all all
 
03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:08.469 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors all felonies all all
misdemeanors

03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
03:04:08.479 --> 03:04:09.269 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
and

03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
just judging from the testimony it could
 
03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be a number of cases you
 
03:04:16.230 --> 03:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
know maybe even a significant number of
 
03:04:19.030 --> 03:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
cases and when we're talking in circuit
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
court what i'm talking about is three
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
divisions because all judges virtually
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
all judges in circuit court hear from
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
all the divisions so they're hearing
 
03:04:31.269 --> 03:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
probate division cases they're hearing
 
03:04:31.279 --> 03:04:33.750 align:start position:0%
probate division cases they're hearing
circuit

03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
district division cases and family
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
division cases so in any particular day
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
their docket can be filled with these
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
these types of cases
 
03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that with really no
 
03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
notice are
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
bail hearings because they're coming in
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
probably being either transported from a
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
county jail or
 
03:04:55.990 --> 03:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a video arraignment that's
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
occurring depending on whether or not
 
03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's video time available
 
03:05:02.230 --> 03:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's an actual hearing that has to
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
occur in front of a judge because these
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
would otherwise have been handled in
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
front of a bail commissioner so we now
 
03:05:10.389 --> 03:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
have another hearing event that is
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
occurring in front of a circuit court
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
judge who already has a complete docket
 
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
all i'm all
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm talking all i'm suggesting is that
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
these bills have a significant impact
 
03:05:26.790 --> 03:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
on the circuit court on the circuit
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
court judges and
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
probably even more especially on the
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
staff in these circuit courts because
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
they're involved in the paperwork the
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling and getting keeping
 
03:05:39.510 --> 03:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
everything moving and the burden is
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
incredible these days you know as i said
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
relative to the last hearing they're
 
03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
approximately pending at the end of 2021
 
03:05:49.230 --> 03:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
just under a
 
03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
just under a
199

03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
199
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
691 cases pending
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are 46 full-time judges in in
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
circuit court there's two senior judges
 
03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
and one marital master it is a huge
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
volume of cases so every time there is a
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
change in the system that puts more
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
cases in front of those judges you're
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
pushing into a system that is full
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the more that happens the greater
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
the chance at some point we're just
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to hit that point of one too many
 
03:06:21.920 --> 03:06:22.710 align:start position:0%
going to hit that point of one too many
um

03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so all i all i suggest is one this
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
will have a fiscal impact it will
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
need some additional resources
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
especially in the four busiest
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
circuit courts manchester concord nashua
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
and keene
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that are probably
 
03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
going to see the greatest impact from
 
03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
this type of bill bill
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
it currently has a 60-day effective date
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest one is
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i've mentioned this statute before
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
rsa 14 colon 9-a
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
addresses effective dates
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
and talks about any uh any bill or any
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
law that affects judicial process and
 
03:07:01.279 --> 03:07:02.389 align:start position:0%
law that affects judicial process and
procedure

03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh establishes or eliminates criminal
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
prohibitions civil causes or remedies or
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
limitations of actions shall take place
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
shall take effect january 1 of the
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
following year at a minimum we would ask
 
03:07:15.830 --> 03:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the january 1 effective date be be
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
implemented but really what we would be
 
03:07:20.230 --> 03:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
asking is that
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
give give this bill an opportunity to be
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
heard as part of the budget process also
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
at least not the bill but the but the
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact because we're not in a
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
budget year
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
so we are going to see impacts occurring
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
if this becomes effective sooner
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
within the circuit courts which are
 
03:07:38.870 --> 03:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
already overwhelmed and you're just
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to see you know that those cases
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
that can get pushed get pushed civil
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
cases will get pushed other things get
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
pushed and there's delays in the system
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to try to keep things
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
moving to keep things expedited
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
and these types of bills require
 
03:07:58.230 --> 03:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
resources so one other ask is at a
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
minimum january one effective date but
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
really if we can push it to after the
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
budget is passed
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
as an effective date even to the bill
 
03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
passes uh that way we can address those
 
03:08:11.670 --> 03:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
resources needs as well as the sort of
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
cumulative resource issues that are seen
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
in in the bills um that that are in in
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
front of this session not only senator
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
bradley's sb 294
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
but the bill that was heard in judiciary
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
which would rewind felonies first
 
03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that will be heard on the floor of of
 
03:08:32.309 --> 03:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
the of the house that's about roughly
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
another 6 000 cases that would be coming
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
into the circuit courts that are not
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
currently in the circuit courts you know
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
this cumulative effect of these of these
 
03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
this cumulative effect of these of these
bills

03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
is having a a significant as the
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
likelihood of a significant
 
03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the circuit courts
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
that will require resources and i think
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do some of that in the
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
budget process is is really the most
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable way of trying to approach it
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i would be happy
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i have a question
 
03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
i i have a question
um

03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
prior to the bail reform bill of 2016
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
has there been a significant cut in
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
judicial staff
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that adding this
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
in other words this isn't really
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
unless there's been a significant cut in
 
03:09:23.590 --> 03:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
judicial staff this isn't adding
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
anything more than was already on the
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
plate in 2016 is that correct
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
truthfully i didn't practice criminal
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
law and didn't wasn't in the court
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
system back then so i actually don't
 
03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
know what the balance was uh in terms of
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
post pre sort of that that sort of
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the difference was uh
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
truthfully and so i couldn't answer that
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it though is other
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
burdens that have been added since then
 
03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:48.469 align:start position:0%
burdens that have been added since then
also

03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
because every legislative cycle there
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
tends to be some additional changes that
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
are that are implemented
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative bourne has a
 
03:09:57.520 --> 03:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative bourne has a
question

03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:02.070 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to have no more arrests in
 
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
no more new cases
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
put before us
 
03:10:09.439 --> 03:10:10.229 align:start position:0%
put before us
uh

03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
how long would you could you give me an
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
estimate how much time it would take for
 
03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
the court systems to clear
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
a little over a year
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh so we we roughly get 175 000 filings
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:10:27.750 --> 03:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the case too so
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
some just by their nature take longer
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
some are very quick
 
03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
some are very quick
um

03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
so if we get in 175 000 we're up to
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
around around 200 000 now
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
into 175 new ones we're pending around
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
200 there's about a 25 000 increase gap
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
between those some of that is covid
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
related but really the circuit court has
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
has worked down a lot of its covet
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
backlogs um
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
so you know more than a year how much
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
more than a year i i don't know
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and and actually let me take
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
one step back in that's just criminal
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
docket you know with
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that 175 the 200 that's all of the all
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the circuit all of the districts so
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
district division
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
um uh probate and and family division um
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we're just cutting out the criminal
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
highest number within within
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
circuit court you know those tend to get
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
cleared out and could get cleared out
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
probably within a year
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:11:35.590 --> 03:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
um on bills like this that are that are
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
framed as fixing flaws in the judicial
 
03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
system one of the things that we hear a
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
lot is
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot about the importance of
 
03:11:49.510 --> 03:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
fixing those flaws regardless of the
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
impact on the judicial system
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
what are some of the unintended
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
consequences that happen in your opinion
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
when we take that kind of an approach
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
and in particular if we were to take
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
that approach with this bill
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question the you
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
impact any time of of adding
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
especially in in the criminal context
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
which has
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
certain constitutional overlays and and
 
03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
statutory overlays in terms of timing
 
03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:18.630 align:start position:0%
statutory overlays in terms of timing
and

03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
processing is it simply means other
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
types of cases get pushed later so civil
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
cases small claim
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
cases that don't have the same
 
03:12:33.510 --> 03:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh type of of statutory or
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
get her
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
sort of get filtered in where they can
 
03:12:41.190 --> 03:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the same
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
deadline they're not driven by the same
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
deadline so they just get pushed later
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
so it just may be a significant period
 
03:12:49.269 --> 03:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
of time before
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
a small claims case gets reached
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
it also is you know increases
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know the the stress on
 
03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
staff is tremendous in terms of you know
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
they're managing
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know 200 000 cases scheduling
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
getting them in the docket putting them
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
in front of the judge getting notices
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
out mistakes happen too and and you just
 
03:13:15.269 --> 03:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
increase the the
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
rate of error
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the extent those happen they do it
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
just a remarkable job
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
but i think the primary one is is you
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
just move
 
03:13:27.030 --> 03:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
a certain class and certain types of of
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
cases to the back of the line
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
so that they just
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
it takes a very long time to get them
 
03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
it takes a very long time to get them
reached

03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls stephen andre's
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is stephen
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
hendricks i'm an attorney with the
 
03:13:58.950 --> 03:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack county attorney's office
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
i've been a prosecutor for a little over
 
03:14:03.349 --> 03:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
20 years now
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
i've appeared in circuit court
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
pretty much every day from
 
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
november 2003 to the start of the
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic in march of uh
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't that was 2019 or 2020 now
 
03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:18.469 align:start position:0%
i don't that was 2019 or 2020 now
but

03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:14:18.479 --> 03:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:14:20.550 --> 03:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
listening to representative barry's
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
comments about this bill
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the takeaway to me
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
is that he said when a person is
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
re-arrested who's out on bail
 
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be brought before a bail
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner they should be brought
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
before a judge
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
and i absolutely agree with that and i
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
think that's a fantastic idea
 
03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
think that's a fantastic idea
um

03:14:43.750 --> 03:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
we've talked a little bit about
 
03:14:45.279 --> 03:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
we've talked a little bit about
shoplifting

03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
shoplifting
 
03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
shoplifting
and

03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
when a person's arrested for shoplifting
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're brought back to the police
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
station they go through booking
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner is called
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
the bill commissioner would come meet
 
03:15:00.070 --> 03:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
with that person
 
03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
and make a determination of whether or
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
not that person is a risk of flight or
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
danger to the community
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
if they're not a risk of flight or a
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
danger to the community they'd be
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
released on personal recognizance bail
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion that's appropriate
 
03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
but personal recognizance fail comes
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
with some conditions
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
and one of those conditions is that you
 
03:15:21.670 --> 03:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
remain of good behavior
 
03:15:23.429 --> 03:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
meaning that while you're released on
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail you don't
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you're released on personal
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail and you do commit an
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
additional crime
 
03:15:38.469 --> 03:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
you've broken your promise to the court
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
to remain of good behavior
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
so it absolutely makes sense to me that
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
instead of having a bail commissioner
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
come and perhaps set pr bail a second
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
time that you should have to go in front
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
of a judge
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
and the judge may set pr bail the judge
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
may set cash bail the judge may set
 
03:15:57.990 --> 03:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
preventative detention depending on the
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
facts of the case
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
but it certainly makes sense to go back
 
03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.990 --> 03:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
with reference to
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
these hearings
 
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
we do bail hearings in circuit court
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
every day
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon to have
 
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
hearings within 24 hours or 36 hours
 
03:16:21.190 --> 03:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
under 594 20a
 
03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
so this isn't something that we're not
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
used to doing
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
if we don't do the hearing within 24 to
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
36 hours and the person's released on pr
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
bail by the bail commissioner we're
 
03:16:33.030 --> 03:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
still doing an arraignment but it may be
 
03:16:36.870 --> 03:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure if you spoke to any
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutor any law enforcement officer
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
all of us could tell you
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
stories for hours about people who have
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
been arrested released on pr bail
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
arrested again released on pr bail
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
arrested again released on pr bail and
 
03:16:57.190 --> 03:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
it continues to happen over and over and
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the number of filings
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
in court
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
i can't help think that maybe if a
 
03:17:06.790 --> 03:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
person is arrested and released on pr
 
03:17:06.800 --> 03:17:08.070 align:start position:0%
person is arrested and released on pr
bail

03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
bail
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
and arrested a second time
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
maybe there won't be a third time
 
03:17:19.510 --> 03:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're arrested when they're on pr bail
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
maybe there won't be a fourth time
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're arrested when they're on pr bail
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
maybe those filings would actually go
 
03:17:26.399 --> 03:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
maybe those filings would actually go
down

03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty that i have with
 
03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty that i have with
um

03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476
 
03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476
is

03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
i actually really like this section of
 
03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:41.910 align:start position:0%
i actually really like this section of
597.28

03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
597.28
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
the way it currently is written
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i can certainly answer questions
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
about why i like that or why i think
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
this section exists
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think if the issue is that
 
03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners shouldn't be
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
setting bail on people who are
 
03:17:57.279 --> 03:17:59.190 align:start position:0%
setting bail on people who are
released

03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
released
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners have statutory
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
authority under 597.18
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that perhaps amending
 
03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner's statutory
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
authority under 597.18
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
to indicate that bail commissioners are
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
unable to set bail
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
on a person who's already out on bail
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
and that's not an unprecedented thing in
 
03:18:26.309 --> 03:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law if you violate a
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
protective voter under 173 the bill
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner has no authority to set
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
bail you have to go in front of the
 
03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
bail you have to go in front of the
judge

03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that for years
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
we could certainly mirror that with
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
people that are currently released on
 
03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:42.550 align:start position:0%
people that are currently released on
bail

03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
bail
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
so that they do in fact go in front of
 
03:18:46.229 --> 03:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
the court which again
 
03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me that the judge would
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
be the person to decide what the
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
subsequent bail is
 
03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions yes
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative boardnet
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this bill is necessary i'm
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
looking at rsa
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
597 colon
 
03:19:12.870 --> 03:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
7-a which
 
03:19:15.429 --> 03:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
does talk about detention and sanctions
 
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
for the fault of breach of conditions so
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
if a
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
person is a
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
br does break their terms of condition
 
03:19:26.790 --> 03:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
they are brought before judges
 
03:19:28.790 --> 03:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
is that not true
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily true under 597
 
03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:34.710 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily true under 597
7a

03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
7a
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
the detention for sanctions for bail we
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
can file an additional charge of breach
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
of bail if you violate your bail
 
03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
of bail if you violate your bail
conditions

03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
so the way that potentially works is
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the shoplifting example a
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
person shoplifts they're released on pr
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
they shoplift a second time
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're again released on pr bail
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
the second time i can not only file a
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
shoplifting charge but i can file an
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional breach of bail charge
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
but they would still potentially be
 
03:20:06.870 --> 03:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
released on pr bail by a bail
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner that person could go out a
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
third time and i've certainly had this
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
experience where after being charged
 
03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
with breach of bail
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
they violate their bail conditions again
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
by committing a new crime and they again
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
are released by on by a bail
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner on personal recognizance
 
03:20:24.080 --> 03:20:25.429 align:start position:0%
commissioner on personal recognizance
bail

03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
bail
 
03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
under 597 7a i can file a motion asking
 
03:20:32.469 --> 03:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
that their bail be revoked
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
my experience with that though is that
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
those motions
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
get scheduled
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
in the regular course in court
 
03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
so i may file a motion to revoke
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone's bail but i may not get a
 
03:20:46.710 --> 03:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on that for 30 to 45 days after
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's filed
 
03:20:48.479 --> 03:20:49.510 align:start position:0%
it's filed
i've

03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
i've
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
had the experience that during that 30
 
03:20:54.309 --> 03:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
to 45 days while my motion revoked bail
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
is pending the person is again arrested
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i was shocked that they were
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
released on personal recognizance bail
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there was a motion
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i i'm looking at paragraph five in
 
03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
this uh rsa
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
our paragraph one
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh and a sentence says the accused will
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
be brought before a justice for a bell
 
03:21:23.349 --> 03:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
rick devotion hearing within 48 hours
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't that a judge or is that
 
03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
you certainly could bring the person
 
03:21:47.190 --> 03:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
before it justice um
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
however there is the provisions of the
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
statute and now
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
the rules of criminal procedure which
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
indicate that a person's entitled to a
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
03:21:56.720 --> 03:21:57.510 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
so

03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
i believe most of the police when
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
they're arresting people for
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
crimes that they've committed while out
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
on bail
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead additional follow-up
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
so maybe rather than writing a new
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
section of law we should
 
03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:19.110 align:start position:0%
section of law we should
make

03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
look at paragraph one
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
and make it uh required that it is a
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
judge in a court that it does here has
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
i certainly think there's other statutes
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
you could amend as i said earlier
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of amending the bail
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner statute you could certainly
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
amend 597 7a to strengthen those clauses
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
i do think there are certainly other
 
03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
statutes you could amend to accomplish
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
the goal that if a person is arrested
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
while out on bail they see a judge
 
03:22:53.590 --> 03:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
instead of a bail commissioner
 
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that these
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
individuals who tend to fall into the
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
category of offense that's
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
tend to be committing
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
victimless crimes
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
or that
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
or that they're extremely minor and i'm
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
wondering in your experience
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
do these crimes have victims and i'm
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
also curious if you could address what
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the victim
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
might share with you when they learn
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
with reference to whether these crimes
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
have victims i think that
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
you could have an academic debate on
 
03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:46.710 align:start position:0%
you could have an academic debate on
that

03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
if i'm the manager of mcdonald's
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i have a homeless person for example
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
who comes into my restaurant
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
and sits down at a booth doesn't
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
purchase anything
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
and falls asleep and i politely ask that
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
person to leave and they refuse to leave
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i call the police the police come
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
ask the person please leave they refuse
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
to leave they're arrested for trespass
 
03:24:15.190 --> 03:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
they're released on personal
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail and they come back to
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think i'm the victim as the owner of
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
that mcdonald's or as the franchisee
 
03:24:24.479 --> 03:24:25.349 align:start position:0%
that mcdonald's or as the franchisee
that

03:24:25.349 --> 03:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
i can't control who's coming in and out
 
03:24:29.190 --> 03:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
of my premises
 
03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i certainly think some of these
 
03:24:34.389 --> 03:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
repeat crimes like trespassing or
 
03:24:34.399 --> 03:24:35.830 align:start position:0%
repeat crimes like trespassing or
shoplifting

03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
shoplifting
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely have
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
tangible victims
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
we've certainly also had
 
03:24:45.429 --> 03:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
the experience where i can think of a
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman who is out on personal
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
attorney sure that this person probably
 
03:24:56.790 --> 03:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
was suffering from mental health issues
 
03:24:56.800 --> 03:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
was suffering from mental health issues
he

03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
he
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
felt that somebody had walked past him
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
and knocked over his coffee which
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that his coffee fell
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
over while this person was walking past
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
him and he proceeded to violently attack
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
that person and send them to the
 
03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:13.590 align:start position:0%
that person and send them to the
hospital

03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i personally care if the
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
person is who's beating me up has mental
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
health issues or if they're just a jerk
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
if i'm being beat up by someone who's
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we certainly have
 
03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:31.750 align:start position:0%
and we certainly have
experienced

03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
input from members of the public with
 
03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
input from members of the public with
frustration

03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
why is this person out to begin with
 
03:25:40.229 --> 03:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
when we have repeat offenses from people
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
on bail
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question and
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this whole
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussion has to do with this one word
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
shall or may one gives discretion and
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
one does eliminates discretion
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm it seems like the testimony that
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing is that bail commissioners
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
just always give out personal
 
03:26:11.190 --> 03:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
and that when they go before a judge
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
that won't happen i
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just confused why
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
if both of them are i guess they're both
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
judicial officers
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
why we're addressing this problem by
 
03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
taking away discretion i think for both
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
judges and bail commissioners if you get
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
arrested on a friday night you you could
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
be there for
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
up to 72 hours even with the exclusions
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the 36. that that's the concern i
 
03:26:36.960 --> 03:26:38.790 align:start position:0%
in the 36. that that's the concern i
have

03:26:38.790 --> 03:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
i agree that both judges and bail
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners have discretion
 
03:26:42.880 --> 03:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
commissioners have discretion
it

03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:26:47.190 --> 03:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
not to give antidotal evidence because i
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's necessarily
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate but it's been my experience
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
that people are more likely to get
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail from a bail
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner than a judge
 
03:26:55.920 --> 03:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
commissioner than a judge
um

03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
but again that that's just my personal
 
03:27:00.319 --> 03:27:01.910 align:start position:0%
but again that that's just my personal
opinion

03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this statute would
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
take discretion away from judges and i
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
we all want judges to have discretion to
 
03:27:13.030 --> 03:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
set the hell as appropriate
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
the shell in this amendment
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
means that the person shall be detained
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
to be brought before a judge
 
03:27:21.990 --> 03:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
so it would take the discretion away
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
from the bail commissioners not
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:35.190 --> 03:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.309 --> 03:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you for your
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls paul halvorson
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm paul halverson merrimack county
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
attorney attorney enduras covered many
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the items that i was going to address
 
03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll defer to his testimony
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
i do have some additional comments
 
03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
i do have some additional comments
though

03:27:58.710 --> 03:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
one of the issues one of the reasons
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
bail exists
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
in its current format is to address the
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
issue of public safety
 
03:28:09.190 --> 03:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at individuals that
 
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
are released on bail and reoffending
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
while out on bail
 
03:28:15.990 --> 03:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
albeit one two three four seven times
 
03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes one of public safety
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
and as attorney andres pointed out
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
the proper venue in in
 
03:28:27.990 --> 03:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion too is that when you violate
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
a promise to the court
 
03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the person to address that should be the
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
judge of that court
 
03:28:34.319 --> 03:28:35.269 align:start position:0%
judge of that court
the

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that attorney andrus mentioned
 
03:28:38.239 --> 03:28:39.269 align:start position:0%
amendment that attorney andrus mentioned
moving

03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:28:39.279 --> 03:28:40.309 align:start position:0%
moving
the

03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:41.630 --> 03:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
change under
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
597.18 to limit the powers of a bail
 
03:28:47.190 --> 03:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner frankly i believe is a much
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
easier methodology
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
to attain what i believe is the goal of
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
the proponent of the bill and that is to
 
03:28:57.670 --> 03:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
to have a serious look by a judicial
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
officer namely a judge on someone who's
 
03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
already been released on
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
on some sort of bail yet continues to
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
violate the
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
the terms of that bail and the promise
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i do think that's appropriate
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
the harsh reality is
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
that there are there are there is a
 
03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
small group of people which commit a
 
03:29:24.309 --> 03:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
larger number of crimes
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
certainly i think the default setting i
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree the majority of
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
people comply with the orders of the
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
court out on bail the vast majority do
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
but you have that small population that
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
becomes a risk to society
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i think you can argue through that
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
risk to society or risk to themselves
 
03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
when they repeatedly offend and by
 
03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
limiting the ability to be released on
 
03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
bail by a bail commissioner forcing that
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
individual to go to the court
 
03:29:54.070 --> 03:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
to account for
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
their actions in a bail and public
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
safety arena
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
is appropriate
 
03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:02.469 align:start position:0%
is appropriate
um

03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
and as i said the best person to do that
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
is indeed
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
a judge not a bail commissioner
 
03:30:12.070 --> 03:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
there have been several anecdotal
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
comments throughout today's test
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
testimony my preparation coming today
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of days i've had
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
some telephone conversations and some
 
03:30:21.269 --> 03:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
email conversations with other
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutors throughout the the the state
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh i don't speak for them individually
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so i'll not use their names and they
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
shared with me some individual cases
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
that are currently open so i'll not
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
share the specifics of the cases but i
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
will share their generalized con
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
concerns as they were as i understood
 
03:30:38.640 --> 03:30:40.229 align:start position:0%
concerns as they were as i understood
them

03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:30:40.239 --> 03:30:41.190 align:start position:0%
them
in

03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
one location a prosecutor mentioned to
 
03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:44.550 align:start position:0%
one location a prosecutor mentioned to
me

03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:30:47.429 --> 03:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
that an individual was finally held
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
after a fourth domestic violence charge
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
now i guess as a as a public policy
 
03:30:53.120 --> 03:30:54.229 align:start position:0%
now i guess as a as a public policy
measure

03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
measure
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
what are we telling a victim of domestic
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
violence or multiple victims of domestic
 
03:30:57.920 --> 03:30:59.349 align:start position:0%
violence or multiple victims of domestic
violence

03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
violence
 
03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
when that when a person who reoffends
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
while they're out on bail
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
is not being held or not being reviewed
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
by a judge and may be released by a bail
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner what kind of public policy
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
and that's a question that you as a
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee and you as the legislature
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
have to to address
 
03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:19.349 align:start position:0%
have to to address
um

03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
another prosecutor mentioned
 
03:31:21.600 --> 03:31:22.710 align:start position:0%
another prosecutor mentioned
that

03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
defendant in court who is appearing on
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
multiple failures to appear from several
 
03:31:29.520 --> 03:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
multiple failures to appear from several
jurisdictions

03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
again as a public policy matter
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
what are we saying when an individual is
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
released on bail
 
03:31:37.359 --> 03:31:38.229 align:start position:0%
released on bail
and

03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
not appearing and is really so many
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
times that he's now has several
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutors from several jurisdictions
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
in court on the same day
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
to address his behavior in society and
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
his threat to the individuals within
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
in society
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's the bigger concern
 
03:31:59.190 --> 03:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh and as i said i agree that limiting
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
the issue under 597.18 is probably a
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
more appropriate place
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
to place this uh attorney sure made a
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
good point um and i think there'd be
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
several of the prosecutors that would
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
agree with me that generally speaking
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bail statute as it's currently
 
03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:14.229 align:start position:0%
the bail statute as it's currently
written

03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
generally works it really does
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes with these several
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
individuals the small group of
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
individuals that commit the most the
 
03:32:24.389 --> 03:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
most offenses
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
and repeat offenses and it's that small
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
population we need to address
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe one of the ways to address
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is to limit the ability of a bail
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner to set bail and for that
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
person to appear in court as soon as
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
possible and under the current statute
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would be well within 36 hours
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
attorney andrus commented about
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
circuit court issues hearing cases i too
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
practiced in circuit court
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
since 2000 uh up until i was elected as
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
county attorney i appeared frequently in
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
several counties and probably uh four
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
counties and seven or eight circuit
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
courts uh and the job i had before i was
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
county attorney i was in an office where
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
upwards of give or take a couple
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
thousand twenty thousand scheduled
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
hearings a year
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
so the attorneys are already
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues
 
03:33:14.550 --> 03:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh and as was mentioned in prior
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
testimony in multiple hearings often uh
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully an amendment to 597-18
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
to affect the change that i believe the
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee's looking to affect or to pro
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
or to sponsor this bill is looking to
 
03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
affect uh would would be a better way to
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that i'll gladly take any
 
03:33:31.279 --> 03:33:33.670 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that i'll gladly take any
questions

03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sure thank you for answering
 
03:33:39.190 --> 03:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
my question yes sir
 
03:33:39.200 --> 03:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
my question yes sir
so

03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to be
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
the issue seems to be that there we have
 
03:33:47.349 --> 03:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of people with mental illnesses
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:33:48.399 --> 03:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
that are
uh

03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:53.910 --> 03:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
committing and recommitting crimes
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
is there a better solution than putting
 
03:33:59.110 --> 03:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
them in jail or re-arresting them over
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
and over again well if i if i knew the
 
03:34:03.030 --> 03:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that question i
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know i i'd certainly share it but i
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any one answer i
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:09.670 align:start position:0%
can tell you
that

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are throughout the state i believe
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
there are multiple
 
03:34:13.359 --> 03:34:14.630 align:start position:0%
there are multiple
initiatives

03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
to help people navigate the
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
the myriad of services that are
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
available i also understand there's been
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
multiple discussions throughout the
 
03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
multiple discussions throughout the
state

03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
that many of the services service
 
03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:27.190 align:start position:0%
that many of the services service
organizations

03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
are underfunded
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
but that's a question for the
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and and and the
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislature i would note that in
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
merrimack county uh the county uh just
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
began and just uh just funded in the
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
budget process uh a position within the
 
03:34:44.790 --> 03:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
county to help those with substance
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
abuse and mental health issues navigate
 
03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the myriad of services that are
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
available uh and i was part of that the
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and and happy to be part of
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
it in fact we shifted
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
of some of the
 
03:34:57.920 --> 03:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
of some of the
opioid

03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
settlement money
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
that was under my office over to assist
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
in hiring individuals just to accomplish
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
some of those goals
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
so you know i think there's a number of
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
people including myself that are working
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
towards that goal um what the right
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
answer is i don't know i wish i did
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:35:22.830 --> 03:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
newman thank you mr chair thank you for
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir
 
03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir
um

03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
would judges be available uh are they
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
available on the weekend to hear these
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of bail cases or would they not be
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
able to do that and i know the um courts
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
have on-call judges for uh uh for search
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
warrants and items such as that i don't
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
believe they're on call for arraignments
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
frankly i wish the the state did have a
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
24-hour arraignment judge
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
to handle arrests and arraignments on a
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
rolling basis many states many
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions do
 
03:35:57.600 --> 03:35:58.309 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions do
and

03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
if they had a 24-hour
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
pool of judges just for arraignments
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
on a 24-hour basis individuals can be in
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
front of judges within hours uh we live
 
03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
in an electronic world and we're able to
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
move paperwork seamlessly throughout
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh the state
 
03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
but then again that's a that's a matter
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
for the courts to address and uh and the
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
legislature to uh to fund frankly i
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
think would be a great idea uh there are
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
many prosecutors that really do think it
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
would be a great idea and frankly that
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
protects the individual's rights um uh
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
to a uh to a greater extent than i
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
believe that a current then current
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.319 --> 03:36:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh in the anecdotal testimony that we've
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
arrested released arrested released
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
arrested released
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
does that are those people released both
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'd have to give you only my observation
 
03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
i would say more so
 
03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
i would say more so
with

03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
with um with bail commissioners
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
but i deal on in just the superior
 
03:37:11.670 --> 03:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
courts for the most part now uh the
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
superior court in merrimack county for
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
the most part now so i i couldn't
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
comment on how the trend has changed in
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
the last year with the with the lower
 
03:37:20.229 --> 03:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
courts uh other than to say that i do
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
have several individuals that are
 
03:37:23.910 --> 03:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors within the county that are
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
telling me that that folks are still
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
released and re-arrested
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
several times
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:35.200 align:start position:0%

03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee i will be uh

gonna read that word for word i'm out of
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
respect for everybody's time people are
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
probably already dwindling out of the
 
03:38:04.150 --> 03:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
room um
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
prior to the attorney from merrimack
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
county speaking um
 
03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
i come to you let me first start as a
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
chief of police for the city of
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
manchester um
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of comments today
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
which some i agree with on both sides
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to clear the record that as
 
03:38:21.030 --> 03:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
a chief of police of manchester i did
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
not ask the sponsor as was
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
insinuated by the unh professor that i
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
asked for this bill
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
that is not a fair assessment it's not
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
accurate i'd like to clear the record on
 
03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:33.510 align:start position:0%
accurate i'd like to clear the record on
that

03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
we've heard about
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
impacts on the judicial branch impacts
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the offenders
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
prior to the gentleman from merrimack
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
county i haven't heard any discussion
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
about impact on victims
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
and why are we having that discussion as
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
a community
 
03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
a community
as

03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
a legislative body as law enforcement we
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
have it every day
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
so i think that needs to come more to
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%

03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
violence child abuse
 
03:39:01.189 --> 03:39:01.199 align:start position:0%

03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
losing money
 
03:39:04.870 --> 03:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims that are being
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
offended over and over
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's time for that discussion to come to
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the forefront um
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know along the lines of the bail
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner under the statue of
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
597.18 i believe i believe you said um
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
maybe that is the right place to do this
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
the bill commissioners
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
do not work for me they work for the
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
court but they lack training they lack
 
03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:29.030 align:start position:0%
court but they lack training they lack
expertise

03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
they lack that subject matter expert on
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
the laws that the judge has
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
so getting these people in front of a
 
03:39:37.269 --> 03:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
judge within 36 hours our repeat
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
offenders is probably more appropriate
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you is more appropriate
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
than having the bail commissioner take
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
on that responsibility
 
03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
put it where it belongs in the courtroom
 
03:39:47.439 --> 03:39:48.229 align:start position:0%
put it where it belongs in the courtroom
um

03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
there are times where this current bail
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
bar does work judges do hold people
 
03:39:54.550 --> 03:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
judges do hold people on preventative
 
03:39:54.560 --> 03:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
judges do hold people on preventative
detention

03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
detention
 
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
there are times when they don't but
 
03:39:57.520 --> 03:39:58.309 align:start position:0%
there are times when they don't but
that's

03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're the judge and they're acting
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the law i may not
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
always agree with somebody being
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
released on pr bill out of a court but
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that's the judge's
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
decision and we respect that
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and i'll end with
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know 36 hours doesn't seem like a
 
03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
to me it's not and if that's one less
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
victim or
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
one less opportunity to somebody to
 
03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:22.710 align:start position:0%
one less opportunity to somebody to
reoffend

03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
reoffend
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
i worry about
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
what's it going to take in this state
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
and this just isn't manchester um
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
we have a tendency in our society
 
03:40:32.479 --> 03:40:33.590 align:start position:0%
we have a tendency in our society
um

03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a country
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
to we wait for that horrible horrible
 
03:40:38.479 --> 03:40:39.349 align:start position:0%
to we wait for that horrible horrible
moment

03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
and then we say you know what now we got
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
to really do something and let's name
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
this bill after this victim
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
who was gunned down
 
03:40:46.479 --> 03:40:47.590 align:start position:0%
who was gunned down
or

03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
murdered as a result of a domestic
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
violence incident we see it all the time
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
do we not we we name bills after people
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we don't do that until something
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
serious happens and we all go
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
oh now i gotta now i gotta really take
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
this serious um do i have people
 
03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
reoffending in my city um 100 percent i
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
do i can give you an adult and it goes
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
upon anecdotes i'm not going to do that
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
because you're all smart people
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
you all watch the news and read the
 
03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers um
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
but quite frankly
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is very difficult on law
 
03:41:17.120 --> 03:41:18.389 align:start position:0%
this is very difficult on law
enforcement

03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:41:20.550 --> 03:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's a drain on resources
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
drain on the
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
mental health of my police officers when
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
they have to arrest the same person
 
03:41:30.070 --> 03:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
within 36 hours
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
for some violent offenses
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
and i i don't want to
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
stand in front of an officer of my
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
one of my officers families or one of
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
your families and say hey
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're sorry that your your loved one was
 
03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
we're sorry that your your loved one was
killed

03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
killed
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
by gunfire or whatever other means
 
03:41:47.279 --> 03:41:48.710 align:start position:0%
by gunfire or whatever other means
um

03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to because we
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to wait for the offender to
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
be held for 36 hours to go see a judge
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's time to start talking about victims
 
03:41:58.080 --> 03:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
it's time to start talking about victims
and

03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for my tone if i get a little
 
03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:02.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for my tone if i get a little
aggressive

03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
just getting a little frustrated with
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
and all the other impacts that people
 
03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
that are reoffending are having on our
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
society and it's just not fair to the
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
good people of this state quite frankly
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative lin
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes chief i wonder you seem i think
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
you'd be probably in a very good
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
position to comment on this do you
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
what would be your view and it's i know
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's really beyond the scope of this
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill but what would be your
 
03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:31.670 align:start position:0%
particular bill but what would be your
view

03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
view
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the idea of just doing away with bail
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners all together and saying
 
03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:37.110 align:start position:0%
commissioners all together and saying
everybody

03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
when you get arrested you go before a
 
03:42:40.150 --> 03:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
judge no i don't i don't think we have
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to go that far i mean bill commissions
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
serve a purpose in our in our system
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
because you have those people that
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
may be arrested for that minor
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
shoplifting no criminal record um first
 
03:42:50.319 --> 03:42:51.269 align:start position:0%
shoplifting no criminal record um first
arrest

03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know pr bill is probably appropriate
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
um they have cut they have connections
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
to the community they have a job um they
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
made that one mistake okay pr bill there
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
was appropriate so eliminating bill
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner is not something i would
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would be in support of okay i just
 
03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
think maybe what i think they need is
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
some more training and more education um
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
and some maybe some attention should be
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
paid to that because they they come in
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
well intended to do the good do the
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
right thing um
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
but sometimes things get cloudy for them
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i can't and my officers can't tell a
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner what bills should be
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
we cannot do that all right we can only
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
present them
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
the facts of the arrest and then they
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
have to make the decision from there
 
03:43:36.150 --> 03:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%

03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
question shall i say absolutely sir i'm
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%

rs 597
 
03:43:55.030 --> 03:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh 7a yes sir paragraph 1a
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it actually does prefer
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
a person that validates restraining
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%

issued and appear for justice within 12
 
03:44:12.309 --> 03:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
hours correct
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
do you ever use that yes we do and at
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
597.7 we also use that um
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to violation of bail or
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
breach of bailout the attorney prior to
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
me has spoken about um that's something
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that's a practice that the
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
manchester police adheres to so if
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
you're out on bail if you're out on bail
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and you reoffend
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
we will file a
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke your bail
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
but does that necessarily mean that
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're held it does not
 
03:44:43.510 --> 03:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative board name
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
with that so what is this bill needed
 
03:44:52.150 --> 03:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
since uh this particular section of law
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
really allows you to uh
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
have them for a judge that's on domestic
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
violence related offenses right did you
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
not say 173
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 173 those would be domestic violence
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
related offenses and this also refers to
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh 480
 
03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
458 coen 16.
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh it is talking about
 
03:45:16.710 --> 03:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
valuing the restraining order as well as
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
protective custody representative
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
boarding just before you continue just
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
understand that the witness does not
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
have that the rsa that you remember i
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to is 173 you're
 
03:45:32.070 --> 03:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
referring to domestic violence related
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
offenses violation of restraining orders
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
those type of um
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
particular violation restraining order
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
some will be held pending to see a judge
 
03:45:41.279 --> 03:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
some will be held pending to see a judge
uh

03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
we should be recognized for a follow-up
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:45.439 --> 03:45:46.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
i

03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
only brought up paragraph one a because
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:45:52.150 --> 03:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
the issue you were brought up
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:45:54.319 --> 03:45:55.349 align:start position:0%
but uh
paragraph

03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:45:55.359 --> 03:45:56.790 align:start position:0%
paragraph
one

03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
also talks about any particular crime
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is being uh committed by a
 
03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
that is being uh committed by a
uh

03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
someone who's violating their
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
terms of their release
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
correct and you can file a motion
 
03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
to revoke their bill
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
right which we do as a matter of
 
03:46:15.199 --> 03:46:16.630 align:start position:0%
right which we do as a matter of
practice

03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:17.429 align:start position:0%
practice
so

03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's not i understand where i think i
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from i
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
think um
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
i the importance of this is getting the
 
03:46:29.680 --> 03:46:30.630 align:start position:0%
i the importance of this is getting the
offender

03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
offender
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge as opposed to a bail
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i think
 
03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i think
there's

03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know we may have better outcomes if
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
is hearing
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
these cases when 36 hours as opposed to
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
a a bail commissioner um
 
03:46:49.830 --> 03:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
setting bill when it may not have been
 
03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
setting bill when it may not have been
appropriate

03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
but some jurisdictions don't there's
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
some jurisdictions that don't
 
03:46:55.520 --> 03:46:56.389 align:start position:0%
some jurisdictions that don't
um

03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:56.399 --> 03:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
um
exercise

03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
finally a motion to revoke bail some do
 
03:47:03.510 --> 03:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
and some don't so i think this would add
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing it this way would add more
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
also i'll read a sentence from the
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph one the cues should be brought
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
before a justice for a bail refresh and
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
hearing within 40 hours now are you
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
telling me that that judge
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
justice is
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
could be a bill commissioner as well as
 
03:47:29.359 --> 03:47:30.389 align:start position:0%
could be a bill commissioner as well as
a

03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:47:30.399 --> 03:47:31.349 align:start position:0%
a
judge

03:47:31.349 --> 03:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:47:32.550 --> 03:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's it i don't think
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
that states bill commissioner does it no
 
03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
it does not okay
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
it says justice
 
03:47:38.479 --> 03:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
it says justice
so

03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
well this is it's a healthy back and
 
03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
well this is it's a healthy back and
forth

03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
forth
 
03:47:46.229 --> 03:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
you only permit to ask members of the
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
public testifying questions
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
and just be specific and again the
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
witness does not have the irs in front
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chair uh thank you for
 
03:47:57.670 --> 03:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
answering my question i'm happy to have
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
that discussion offline if you'd like to
 
03:48:04.229 --> 03:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:48:11.110 --> 03:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely sir when somebody
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
is arrested on a friday afternoon in
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
manchester and this bill is in effect in
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
the future
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a process
 
03:48:22.229 --> 03:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have the availability of a
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner any longer
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
what happens to them where
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
do you detain them or
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
do they go to the county jail or what
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to that person well they
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
would you would still they would still
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
have access to the bill commissioner if
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
they were arrested on a
 
03:48:40.150 --> 03:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
thursday morning at four o'clock in the
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
morning or friday afternoon two o'clock
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
they would still have access to a bail
 
03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:47.830 align:start position:0%
they would still have access to a bail
commissioner

03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then bail would be
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm talking about if this
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
bill if bail commission this bill within
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the 30 36 hours it says within 36 hours
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
but it also does it also says
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding something else it means
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
that you they would not be able to go as
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
i understand reading the bill maybe i'm
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
wrong they'd be transported to the
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
county jail to the county jail we can be
 
03:49:09.439 --> 03:49:10.630 align:start position:0%
county jail to the county jail we can be
arraigned

03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
arraigned
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
within that 36 hours weekends and
 
03:49:14.790 --> 03:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
holidays excluded
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
right so they would not be
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
in manchester i can tell you that if
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're arrested on that friday
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon and we can't get them in front
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be in front of the judge on
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
monday afternoon
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
either district court or in superior
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
court that's how we that's how we handle
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
it follow-up representative newman you
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and i know that
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
i listened to your testimony and you
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
thought that bail commissioners should
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
not be eliminated
 
03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that there could be
 
03:49:48.150 --> 03:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
something better do
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
where they might be trained and and be
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
brought up to a standard that would be
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful i wouldn't i think
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
they would they would welcome that
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
because i've had those discussions with
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bill commissioners that
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
they wish they had got some type of
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
further training in education
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls frank knack aclu
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
today my name is frank knack i'm the
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are here
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
in opposition to 1476.
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
i guess you all have my testimony you
 
03:50:48.150 --> 03:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
should have my testimony soon um i think
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that we are
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
talking about taking the liberty or
 
03:50:52.150 --> 03:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
depriving delivery of potentially
 
03:50:54.150 --> 03:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite staters
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the entire discussion today has been
 
03:50:57.990 --> 03:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
based on anecdote and i think that that
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
should be worrisome to everyone on this
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee and so you know while
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
proponents have not brought data i
 
03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to bring some
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
data to the discussion
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
and so as um
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
police commissioner shearer noted uh
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
earlier uh today when bail reform went
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
to effect in 2018
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
so i went to the department of public
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
safety website looked at crimes crime
 
03:51:22.150 --> 03:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
data from 2018 2019 and 2020 there's no
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
2021 data available yet so those are the
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
most current years we have crime in new
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire is down 14
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
during that time period
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
again we heard a lot of talk about
 
03:51:32.239 --> 03:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
again we heard a lot of talk about
manchester

03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
so between 2018 and 2020 crime is down
 
03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:38.630 align:start position:0%
so between 2018 and 2020 crime is down
10.6

03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
10.6
 
03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
for group a crimes arrests are down 38.5
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
for group a crimes and for group b
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
crimes arrests are down
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
28.7 percent
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
we also heard a lot about shoplifting
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
and concerns about shoplifting
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
shoplifting between 2018 and 2020 is
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
down 21.2 percent
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so while i'm not going to sit here
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
and say
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
crimes are down because we did bail
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
reform the notion that crime that bail
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
reform is making our communities less
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
safe is not supported by the data and so
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think it would be prudent for this
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee as a first step if there is
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
some alleged concerns that we would
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually have a data collection as a
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
logical first step before potentially
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
depriving thousands of people of their
 
03:52:21.199 --> 03:52:22.389 align:start position:0%
depriving thousands of people of their
liberty

03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
liberty
 
03:52:22.399 --> 03:52:23.429 align:start position:0%
liberty
um

03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
again this base this this bill is based
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
in fear not evidence i think it's also
 
03:52:29.670 --> 03:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
important to note that this bill does
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
not make our community safer again as it
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
has been noted before existing law has
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
provides the authority to hold people
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
who pose a danger to their communities
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's an individualized assessment that
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
is a proper way to do it we should not
 
03:52:43.279 --> 03:52:43.990 align:start position:0%
is a proper way to do it we should not
be

03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
grouping everyone together and then
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
depriving groups of people of their
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
liberty just because it's more
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
convenient for the courts or more
 
03:52:54.150 --> 03:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
convenient for law enforcement
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and again i think we just had just
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
heard um um someone testified that 36
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
hours isn't a big deal i think you know
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
for folks who are working everyone knows
 
03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
that 36 hours is a big deal if you're a
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
parent if you have a job it's a shift
 
03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
job where you can't miss work
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
if you have other responsibilities you
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
can lose employment income your house
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
within 36 hours this is a big deal for a
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people and i think it's important
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't underscore that
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a bill that would
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
literally allow people to be
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated pre-trial
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
for an offense where the max punishment
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
if convicted
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
carries no jail time i mean that to me
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
is just something that should be deeply
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
concerning to everyone on this committee
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
discuss these items with you all today
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i know a lot's been already discussed
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
i will you know hope you all will read
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
um i think actually one one final point
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about solutions and
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
so we do know that there are solutions
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
to a lot of the problems playing in
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
society i think there was a question
 
03:54:00.630 --> 03:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
about mental health earlier you know we
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
decarcerated the uh the uh
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
institutionalized mental health facility
 
03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
60 70 years ago and didn't provide any
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
wrap around supports that is the problem
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
that is the thing that we need to
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
address we know from social science data
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
that if we want to reduce crime and make
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
our community safer access to housing
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
access to living wage those are things
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
that actually make our community safer
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
and actually address crime policing is
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
inherently reactive it doesn't reduce
 
03:54:27.750 --> 03:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
crime again social studies social
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
science studies have shown that time and
 
03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
science studies have shown that time and
again

03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about depriving
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
potentially thousands of people there
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
liberty i think it's important and again
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know we've tried this with zero
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
tolerance policies in schools we've
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
tried this with mandatory minimum
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
policies in the adult context again they
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't work individualized is the proper
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
way to go and so i urge the committee
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill and to engage in
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
some robust data collection because
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to be doing so thank
 
03:54:53.520 --> 03:54:56.070 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to be doing so thank
you

03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
and i guess you can look at the
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic here so from 2018 to 2019
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
overall crime went from 40 uh 8404 per
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
100 000 to 78.56 so in a reduction we
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
saw a steady reduction over all those
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
years and so if you're just looking at
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
the pre-covered years you also see a
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
steady reduction in crime
 
03:55:33.910 --> 03:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that follows the general trend that
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
was even before bail reform even 2017 it
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair are you discouraging questions
 
03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
is it okay
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we're trying to keep
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
time are you asking
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
making a parliamentary inquiry
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for you're recognize
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
03:55:56.880 --> 03:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
um

03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
are we in need of uh
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
i've not stated that there's any
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
restriction on the amount of questions
 
03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
any member can ask when we run behind
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
schedule the practice in this committee
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
has been i would normally
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
limit members to two questions per
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
witness okay nothing's in place right
 
03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:16.710 align:start position:0%
witness okay nothing's in place right
now

03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
i do have a question so you know you
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
wish to be recognized for a question of
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
the witness
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes please you're recognized it'll be
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
quick it'll be quicker than i wanted it
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:56:25.359 --> 03:56:26.150 align:start position:0%
to be
um

03:56:26.150 --> 03:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate the point that you
 
03:56:30.150 --> 03:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
made about what i would call the social
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
safety net that could fix this
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
in a less expensive way i'm curious to
 
03:56:35.279 --> 03:56:36.309 align:start position:0%
in a less expensive way i'm curious to
know

03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
because i've heard that from concord's
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
police chief and i represent
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
a lower income part of concord
 
03:56:43.279 --> 03:56:44.870 align:start position:0%
a lower income part of concord
um

03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
do you have data
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful to that continuing
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
debate that this bill and others
 
03:56:55.990 --> 03:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
fit within because i think that
 
03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:57.349 align:start position:0%
fit within because i think that
financial

03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and practical discussion that would be
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
very helpful data for all of us to have
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not on this committee i'm a sub but
 
03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would love to give you my email
 
03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
i would love to give you my email
address

03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:57:09.120 --> 03:57:09.910 align:start position:0%
address
and

03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably would benefit everybody yeah no
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be had there is substantial data and
 
03:57:16.229 --> 03:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to circulate that and in
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
addition there's also lots of new
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
emerging data around violence reduction
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
and solution effective solutions to
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
violent reduction and part of that
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
includes not policing low-level offenses
 
03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so like manchester again 84 of the
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
arrests in manchester in 2018 were
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
low-level non-violent that means only 16
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
percent of the arrests they made in that
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
entire year were for serious matters and
 
03:57:41.429 --> 03:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
so again the research shows that that is
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
if the chair could inquire with a
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
question and uh thank you in advance for
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
at least the original draft of this has
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
to do with someone who's arrested while
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
what it what what if this policy i think
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
you don't support
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
what policy would you would you support
 
03:58:08.150 --> 03:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
where you actually can hold people
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
accountable for violating the conditions
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
we think the existing statute has
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to ensure that
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
people who violate their conditions are
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
held responsible um and that there's an
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
individualized assessment in those cases
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
and if they pose a danger they should be
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
handled but again we're housing using
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
our jails as a solution to people
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental health crises
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
substance use etc is ineffective it's
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive if we actually maximize
 
03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive if we actually maximize
that

03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so we you know we would urge
 
03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
investments and actual you know reducing
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
investments in life-affirming services
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
that are actually going to address the
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
underlying causes that are creating
 
03:58:48.000 --> 03:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
underlying causes that are creating
um

03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pratt
 
03:58:55.359 --> 03:59:01.269 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pratt
hello

03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry about that i know the aclu
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
looks out for the rights of people
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have heard today of rape attacks
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
with pipes injuries by people out on
 
03:59:12.150 --> 03:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
bail what is your position on the rights
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the victims
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
from people that are repeat offenders
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
and people are out on bail yeah no i
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and i think the
 
03:59:22.150 --> 03:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
existing law has mechanism in place to
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that those people can and can be
 
03:59:23.920 --> 03:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
ensure that those people can and can be
held

03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
held
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's incumbent upon law enforcement
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
to make the case to the bail
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner that the person should be
 
03:59:32.229 --> 03:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
held but the existing law clearly states
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
that someone can be held if they pose a
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
danger to the community and so again
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's the individualized way that we
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
think is most appropriate to maximize
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
the reduce the likelihood that we are
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
holding people who don't need to be held
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
but again have a mechanism in place to
 
03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
hold people who do pose a danger to
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
their community
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
so at that point they have an assessment
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
they don't really have an assessment of
 
03:59:52.229 --> 03:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
a person
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that they were charged
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
with a crime and bail it out
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
well if they were arrested they would
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
have the facts surrounding that arrest
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
and to then bring to the bail
 
04:00:04.150 --> 04:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner to make the case
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i think you know one of the things
 
04:00:07.030 --> 04:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
that i think it's also important to
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
remember in this context is that we
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
heard you know a number of the
 
04:00:12.150 --> 04:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
proponents continually talk to about
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
these people as offenders and again
 
04:00:16.150 --> 04:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
these are people in our criminal justice
 
04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
system which i think is most appropriate
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
who have not been convicted of any crime
 
04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
who are then alleged to have been
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
done something else they have not been
 
04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
convicted in any context they are not
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
offenders in any context they are merely
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
people who have are out on bail who are
 
04:00:33.189 --> 04:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
alleged to have done something and so we
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism in place to ensure that
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
if they if they do pose a danger the the
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can make the case and
 
04:00:43.110 --> 04:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bell commissioner can hold them
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't this bill make that easy to do
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
this bill would mandate that they're
 
04:00:48.160 --> 04:00:49.269 align:start position:0%
this bill would mandate that they're
held

04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
held
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think that is um um uh
 
04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to put this this is um
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's a blanket approach to something
 
04:00:59.750 --> 04:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
that will catch in it you know
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
thousands potentially thousands of
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
people who pose no danger to their
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
communities and who have families that
 
04:01:06.550 --> 04:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
rely upon them who have jobs that will
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
be destroyed that will be taken away
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
with houses and income that will be lost
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
if we do this
 
04:01:12.640 --> 04:01:13.830 align:start position:0%
if we do this
okay

04:01:13.830 --> 04:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:17.670 --> 04:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis
 
04:01:19.510 --> 04:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
question you just said that
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
these people would be losing their jobs
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
and their homes and everything
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh if they've committed a crime
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
why does that matter
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
well they haven't committed they've
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
alleged to have committed a crime but
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
then our you know as you know in our
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
legal system you're innocent until
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
proven guilty um and we think you know
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
particularly for people who do not pose
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
a danger to their society we should not
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
we know that jail is an ineffective
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
solution to making our communities safer
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
and so you know we also know from social
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
science research that people having
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
employment that people have steady
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
housing is more effective at reducing
 
04:01:58.150 --> 04:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know the likelihood of people
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
committing crimes for people who do have
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
criminal records the likelihood that
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
they will recidivate
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
and so we think it's you know most
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
important to actually follow the social
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
science data and the the data in terms
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
of what's more effective in terms of
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
making our community safer and in that
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
case it would be trying to ensure that
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
folks have housing
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
have you know you know and if they have
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
kids that their kids are you know not
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
put out on the street
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for testimony the chair
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
has a question and thank you again in
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
04:02:30.800 --> 04:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
there was a
bill

04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
it was uh sb 92
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
passed in this committee as amended it
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
was ultimately tabled
 
04:02:36.880 --> 04:02:37.750 align:start position:0%
was ultimately tabled
uh

04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
comparing that to this and i'm not
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
asking the line for lines for each one
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
but from a policy perspective on really
 
04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
but from a policy perspective on really
addressing

04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
04:02:45.120 --> 04:02:46.229 align:start position:0%
addressing
uh

04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
filing conditions of release and whether
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
or not to bring someone in front of a
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
judge as opposed to a bail commissioner
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
i guess can you compare the two and any
 
04:02:58.150 --> 04:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts on which policy may have been
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
more tailored towards a specific issue
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
yeah no i appreciate the question i
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
think you know in sb 92 i think one of
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
our main concerns was it had the 13
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
offenses that mandated
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
detention again not individualized
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
assessment but just because a you know
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
you are alleged to have done something
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i think we all know
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that charges are
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
brought and then once the prosecutor
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
gets the case file they may rethink what
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
those charges are and whether they were
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and they could be reduced
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
and so again you're going to be you know
 
04:03:28.229 --> 04:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
incarcerating people pre-trial
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
for something that the prosecutor could
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
then reduce before they even get to
 
04:03:32.080 --> 04:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
then reduce before they even get to
trial

04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
trial
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not it's inconsistent with
 
04:03:37.830 --> 04:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think the best practices of a judicial
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
system should be i think you know from
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
our perspective the existing law works
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
the data shows that it's working we've
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
had substantial reductions in crime and
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
in arrests in new hampshire since bail
 
04:03:51.990 --> 04:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
reform went to effect
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know we would of course be willing
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be a part of any collaborative
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
project to discuss more effective
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
solutions and ways that we can make our
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
system stronger and i think as police
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner shir noted
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think that discussion should include
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders broad spectrum stakeholders
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
social service providers mental health
 
04:04:09.520 --> 04:04:11.429 align:start position:0%
social service providers mental health
practitioners

04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
substance use experts
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
folks who work in in low income housing
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
and people experiencing lack of housing
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think we need to have a cumulative
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
wraparound response to how we can make
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
and and thank you thank you for taking
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
my question and one last follow-up
 
04:04:31.680 --> 04:04:32.550 align:start position:0%
my question and one last follow-up
it

04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that there's no objection
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
to holding a person or detaining a
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
person to they appear in front of a bail
 
04:04:37.279 --> 04:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
person to they appear in front of a bail
commissioner

04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:04:39.990 --> 04:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
why is there an objection to holding
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
that person do they appear in front of a
 
04:04:41.439 --> 04:04:43.590 align:start position:0%
that person do they appear in front of a
judge

04:04:43.590 --> 04:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think our concern is the the timeline
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so if if the judge would get them
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
right away that's so but we need to
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's a mechanism in place
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we are not holding people
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and so the mechanism we
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
have in place now is the bill
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
commissioners that they're they they can
 
04:04:58.239 --> 04:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
commissioners that they're they they can
see

04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much right away and that's an
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
effective way it's the data shows that
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's working um and that the bail
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners have the authority to hold
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
see new hands raise the witnesses
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
excused thank you for your testimony
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%

forward and i've heard about the
 
04:05:49.120 --> 04:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
forward and i've heard about the
antidotes

antidotes
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%

04:06:12.160 --> 04:06:13.269 align:start position:0%
services
when

04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
bail reform first came up
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
i thought it was a good idea
 
04:06:19.279 --> 04:06:20.790 align:start position:0%
i thought it was a good idea
however

04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
i have learned
 
04:06:22.399 --> 04:06:23.349 align:start position:0%
i have learned
that

04:06:23.349 --> 04:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:23.359 --> 04:06:25.030 align:start position:0%
that
people

04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
who are committing crimes repeatedly
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
have learned how to circumvent the
 
04:06:31.439 --> 04:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
have learned how to circumvent the
system

04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
system
so

04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
what happens to someone who is homeless
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
and it's cold they commit a cri before
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
bail reform they committed a crime on
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
friday night so they would be warm till
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
sunday or monday before they could get
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now
 
04:06:50.000 --> 04:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now
is

04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
they are trying to
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
so what's happening and i know this
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
because i volunteer in manchester i
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
volunteer without homeless i volunteer
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
with our mental health folks and i
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
volunteer with our substance abuse folks
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling you that this bill is
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
very much needed um and the reason for
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
these folks are being brought toward the
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner oftentimes the bail
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner only knows that instance
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
they don't know that they have sometimes
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
they don't know that they have multiple
 
04:07:26.560 --> 04:07:27.510 align:start position:0%
they don't know that they have multiple
um

04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:27.520 --> 04:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
um
things

04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
in their background that they have not
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
been held accountable and responsible
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
for we teach our children
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
actions have consequences
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
by having these putting these bail
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
commissioners in a position where they
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't they may not have all the
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
information even the officers don't
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
always have the information it's not
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that we need to
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
start holding that percentage of the
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
population accountable for their
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
behavior and it's it's not a i looked up
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
what is a victimless
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
what is the legal
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
um definition of a victim victimless
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
crime it's a
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's no apparent victim or no apparent
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
pain or injury
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
any crime has pain or injury to some
 
04:08:18.399 --> 04:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
any crime has pain or injury to some
extent

04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
extent
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
even if it's even if it's violating your
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
so you have someone that's tagging the
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
the side of the highways with gang
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
um messages
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's a victim that that that
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
crime has a victim not just the fence
 
04:08:42.790 --> 04:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
not just the public property
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
the victim is the
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator is sending a message
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
every crime has a victim shoplifting you
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
know who the victims of shoplifting are
 
04:08:55.040 --> 04:08:56.149 align:start position:0%
know who the victims of shoplifting are
us

04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and people who are
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
spending more now because
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
they're not prosecuting shoplifting
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
anymore because it's just too difficult
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
i heard about the
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
crime has gone down well
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay crime's gone down absolutely
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
i would argue that's because people are
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
not being arrested
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
people are not being held accountable
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
and responsible and they can say well
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
i'm homeless or i have mental illness
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a catch-all people should be
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
held accountable and responsible
 
04:09:31.199 --> 04:09:33.910 align:start position:0%
held accountable and responsible
um

04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.550 --> 04:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
also provides some kind of protection
 
04:09:40.080 --> 04:09:41.189 align:start position:0%
also provides some kind of protection
for

04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
all of us as citizens but also it
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
provides protection for our law
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers because
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
you look at you look at
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the number of studies that have been
 
04:09:53.279 --> 04:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
the number of studies that have been
done

04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
when a person breaks the law
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have a consequence for it
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to break the
 
04:10:00.880 --> 04:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to break the
law

04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
and they're going to increase
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
the potential to have a victim so if
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're first victims are just tagging
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
the sides of the road with um gang stuff
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
what's their next crime if they weren't
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
held responsible for that one
 
04:10:20.239 --> 04:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
held responsible for that one
um

04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
i heard about
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
a bill like this
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
would provide transparency it would
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
develop a level of trust that has been
 
04:10:34.159 --> 04:10:35.429 align:start position:0%
develop a level of trust that has been
lost

04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
lost
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and a level and it would bring the
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
community more together because there is
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
a huge divide right now there are a lot
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
of people um
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
in even bedford new hampshire that are
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
fearful of the homeless are fearful of
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
the mentally ill why because that small
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
fraction that have
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
that they've heard about is scary
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's not okay
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
i heard about the statistics
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
thousand we're gonna violate thousands
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
of people's rights
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
so i took that
 
04:11:12.630 --> 04:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
and i because
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
one of the first things i learned in
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
psychology is how to lie with statistics
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
so based on the figures that the last
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
presenter gave me
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
we would be by holding someone in jail
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
until they could get in front of a judge
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
we would be affecting less than
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
one-fourth of the percent one-fourth of
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
a percent
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the total population of new hampshire
 
04:11:41.920 --> 04:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
of the total population of new hampshire
and

04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
he said thousands
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
but i also heard someone else say
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
of those thousands there's only about
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
two percent that are repeat offenders
 
04:11:59.429 --> 04:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
so it would only be affecting it would
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
be affecting a lot lower sub group
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
that would mean
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
that we would be
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
we could potentially be infringing the
 
04:12:11.110 --> 04:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
rights of
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
if they really truly were innocent of
 
04:12:14.080 --> 04:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
if they really truly were innocent of
all

04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
everything they did so the first crime
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the second crime um we would be
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
impacting less than
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
.03 percent
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the population in new hampshire
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
or all the citizens the children the
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we pay
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
for our government to protect us
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
now coming from a social worker
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint you would suspect me to say
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
oh but they have mental illness and they
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
have substance abuse unfortunately i
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
have seen it
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
i have seen it's a
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
joke criminals
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
that are going to commit crimes and
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
going to keep upping the ante no
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
it's more important to commit a crime on
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
friday night when i know this bail
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
commission is on because he lets
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
everyone off
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.600 --> 04:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
something has to be done
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
is it providing more education and
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
providing bail commissioners with more
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
with more consequences if they continue
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.680 --> 04:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
but this is a nice easy clear-cut thing
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
we get them in front of the judges
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
and we allow them
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
it would it would help in my opinion it
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
would help deter the weekend crimes
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
because that's also one of the things
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
that happens is everyone says don't ever
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't ever do this on a on a on a long
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
holiday weekend because you're not going
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
to get a bail commissioner do you know
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes up more than three
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
days to get a bail commissioner to sign
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
your pr bail
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's happened
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
so the fact that i've sat here and heard
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
we're worried about the we're worried
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
about the thousands of people with
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
mental illness and substance abuse and
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
but i care more about the people that
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
are complying with our laws the people
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
who are not violating our
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
the the the rights
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
that our constitution and our first our
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
um declaration of independence provided
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say and i'm more
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking this
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
question could you go back
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
could you go back to your st your
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
numbers and your statistics again
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's about 1.4 million people in new
 
04:15:00.880 --> 04:15:02.309 align:start position:0%
there's about 1.4 million people in new
hampshire

04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think you uh can you just go over your
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
numbers again so
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
1.4 million i put by the last cent by
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
the census of 2020
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
i had only 518 000. so um if i do 1.4
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
million that quarter percent
 
04:15:19.920 --> 04:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
million that quarter percent
is

04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
is significantly reduced so i only so i
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
was doing it back there while i was
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
okay listening so it would be a lot less
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
than it would be
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
it would probably be it would be like 1
 
04:15:37.110 --> 04:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
10 of the population or
 
04:15:37.120 --> 04:15:40.030 align:start position:0%
10 of the population or
0.0

04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:40.040 --> 04:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
0.001

04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
0.001
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
if we were to take the only two percent
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
so instead of 0.03 it would be 0.001
 
04:15:49.040 --> 04:15:50.149 align:start position:0%
so instead of 0.03 it would be 0.001
follow-up

04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
yes i'd i'd like to work with real
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
numbers here
 
04:15:53.920 --> 04:15:54.790 align:start position:0%
numbers here
so

04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
if i i just looked on
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
21 census showed 1.38 million so we
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.560 --> 04:16:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
1400

04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
1400
 
04:16:08.640 --> 04:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
1400
yeah

04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
1400 is
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
would be the number that would be
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay and 1400 is your one percent
 
04:16:18.880 --> 04:16:21.830 align:start position:0%
okay and 1400 is your one percent
0.001

04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
0.001
 
04:16:21.840 --> 04:16:23.349 align:start position:0%
0.001
okay

04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:23.359 --> 04:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
okay

house bill 1335 is a bipartisan bill
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
that revises portions of section 651-a
 
04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
colon 10-a

dealing with the parole of prisoners
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
this bill came about in response to a
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
review and audit of the medical parole
 
04:32:12.479 --> 04:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
review and audit of the medical parole
process

04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the performance audit of 29 2019
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the adult the new hampshire adult
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
these revisions promulgate rules for
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
medical parole encodes that medical
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
parolees have equivalent levels of
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
scrutiny for parole
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
track and review medical parolees and
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
establishes medical parole conditions
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are basically three changes to the
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
current medical parole statute first it
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
revises the membership of the adult
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
parole board and makes terms gender
 
04:32:46.319 --> 04:32:48.149 align:start position:0%
parole board and makes terms gender
neutral

04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
second it revises criteria necessary
 
04:32:53.110 --> 04:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
for determining if an inmate qualifies
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
for medical parole
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
third and lastly it renames the position
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
of executive assistant to the parole
 
04:32:59.120 --> 04:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
of executive assistant to the parole
board

04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
to adult parole board director of
 
04:33:01.920 --> 04:33:05.109 align:start position:0%

04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
section three of this bill was created
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
to clearly and unambiguously
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
determine eligibility and process
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
criteria for medical parole
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
if one were to look at the original bill
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
and specifically i will point out
 
04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
section three roman numeral one on page

two
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
the language as written is very broad
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
without essential details and is
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
it states as criteria quote terminal
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
debilitating and incurable medical

conditioner syndrome end of quote
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
the proposed revision is significantly
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
more detailed clearly stated
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with current medical
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
practice and issues and is clear about
 
04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
practice and issues and is clear about
process

04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%

04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
house bill 1335 now specifies three
 
04:33:48.639 --> 04:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
house bill 1335 now specifies three
categories

04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
categories
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
for medical parole within which
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
all the criteria for medical parole must
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
be met in order to qualify for parole
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
within each of these three separate
 
04:33:59.039 --> 04:34:01.269 align:start position:0%
within each of these three separate
categories

04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
categories
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill outlines
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
specific criteria for each category and
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
as such is more consistent in align with
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
the vast universe of potential
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
qualifying categories which may exist it
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
is no longer one size fits all
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
from a physician's perspective clear
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
rules criteria are critical
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and welcomed in the care of patients
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
these specific qualifying categories
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
recognize that medicine and complex care
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
of patients change over time
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
and has evolved regardless of one's
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
status either as an inmate or not
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
for example the treatment of many
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
complex medical conditions cannot be
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
managed in a correctional facility
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
beyond simply consideration of cost
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
we no longer institutionalize certain
 
04:34:48.551 --> 04:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
patients as a means to isolate them from
 
04:34:48.561 --> 04:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
patients as a means to isolate them from
society

04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
and who may not be appropriate for
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
housing in a correctional facility
 
04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
hospice and palliative care are now
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
recognized specialties with many
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
up-to-date treatment options available
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
for the terminally ill
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
and for whom specialized settings for
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
their care are needed
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
the scope of medicine has expanded and
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
times have changed and these statute
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
changes are better aligned with these
 
04:35:12.080 --> 04:35:14.789 align:start position:0%
changes are better aligned with these
changes

04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and committee members we
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
believe that house bill 1335
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
clearly updates and specifies the
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
processes of medical parole with more
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
specific criteria for consideration of
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
medical parole it clarifies rules of
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
medical parole it tracks and reviews
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
medical parole's parolees
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
it establishes up-to-date parole
 
04:35:33.680 --> 04:35:34.709 align:start position:0%
it establishes up-to-date parole
conditions

04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with and recognizing changes
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
in medical practices
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
and it makes clear
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
parole board responsibilities for
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
medical parolees risk assessment and
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring while on parole
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
we therefore encourage you to vote in
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
support of these important revisions to
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
medical parole
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
we also have here members of the new
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%

04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%

04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%

i'm happy to take any questions now if
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%

house bill 13335
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
specifically the medical parole
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
proportion portion
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is horace

04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire parole board starting my third

year of service
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired transplant and trauma

04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
years or 30 years now
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
as dr murphy mentioned this legislative
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
effort is in response to the performance
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
audit of 2019 of the new hampshire
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
parole board ordered by your committee
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
the overarching criticism of the parole
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
board or its lack of definitions and
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
inconsistent applications
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
the concept of cost as applied to the
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
parole board was unfavorably
 
04:37:45.359 --> 04:37:46.949 align:start position:0%
parole board was unfavorably
viewed

04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
viewed
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
what you have before you is our response
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
to the audit's 16 specific points of
 
04:37:50.879 --> 04:37:52.629 align:start position:0%
to the audit's 16 specific points of
concern

04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
as a starting point i would like to
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the new hampshire adult
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
parole board is an independent and
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
separate entity from the department of
 
04:37:58.639 --> 04:38:00.150 align:start position:0%
separate entity from the department of
corrections

04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
we are continuing from the courts
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
through the doc to to transition inmates
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
into society
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
but we are still functionally and
 
04:38:08.400 --> 04:38:09.990 align:start position:0%
but we are still functionally and
administratively

04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
separate from the department of
 
04:38:11.119 --> 04:38:13.189 align:start position:0%
separate from the department of
corrections

04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
as another perspective we currently have
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
about two to four cases we hear
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
a year and only currently have one act
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
of medical parole parolee
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
but we do have an aging
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
prison population and with increasing
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
medical concerns
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the past two years as i mentioned
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard four cases
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
and they have been they would be slotted
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
into uh each of the three buckets which
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
i'll explain in a moment of a hospice
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
type care
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
a permanently incapacitated type care
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
and what i call the serious and
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
complicated medical condition which is
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
what we wrote in our thing
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think the serious and complicated
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
medical conditions highlights the real
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
difference between what is medical
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
parole and parole
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
while on medical parole the poli was on
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
house arrest
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
which would not allow him to go to the
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
grocery shopping or into the community
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
to attend church as these activities
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
would not have allowed to be allowed in
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
the prison
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is uh we consider this
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
a prison sentence
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
gaining medical
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
care that is needed
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
i do realize the doc has raised concerns
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
about the proposed legislation
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
however what is not challenged is the
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
proposed concept of our definitions of
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
the three buckets if you will
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
for a medical parole to be considered
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
i would also really emphasize and i'll
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
emphasize again
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
the concept or the application of
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
medical parole is through the division
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
of medical and forensic services it is
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
not initiated by
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
an inmate
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
it is uh reserved for those who have not
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
yet met their minimum sentence so that
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
we can't even consider parole
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
and again i think this is an important
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
concept and i think this is a concept
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
that the department of corrections would
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
as to uh
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
the term of the ill
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
this would be the concept here would be
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
someone who is a cancer patient in
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
hospice care
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
the concept of terminal and hospice care
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
is easily definable through medicare and
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid rules
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
the permanently incapacitated
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
the situation here is the person who's
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
had a debilitating stroke
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
who's a paraplegic of some sort cannot
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
care for themselves needs care for their
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
routine hygiene
 
04:40:40.080 --> 04:40:42.830 align:start position:0%
routine hygiene
bathing

04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
toiletry eating feeding
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
it is just beyond the capacity it may be
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
it may not be beyond the capacity but it
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
is a bucket in which the department of
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
corrections has a choice
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the last one is the serious and
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
medical uh
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
complex medical care
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the best example we have which is
 
04:41:06.150 --> 04:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
our most recent one within the system
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
was a paraplegic who had bed sores
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
required uh sense of
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
plastic surgery special beds
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
rehab issues re-operations
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
and required a
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
litany of steps in their care
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
this was also a inmate who came back to
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
us to be considered for parole when that
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
the specific revisions within our system
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh which dr murphy has alluded to
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
is that these would enact uh have
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent levels of screening in other
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
words if they are a serious threat to
 
04:41:48.638 --> 04:41:50.868 align:start position:0%
words if they are a serious threat to
society

04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
would they get paroled no
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
i think two of these categories are
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
quite easily defensible because the
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
inmate is
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
so incapacitated as to
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
any concerns by the doc to the medical
 
04:42:07.920 --> 04:42:10.070 align:start position:0%
any concerns by the doc to the medical
proposal

04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
or will be addressing and i have a
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
meeting with the department of forensic
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
services tomorrow to to work on the
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
i believe our differences are minor
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
essentially perceptions of vocabulary
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
definitions and because we are separate
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
entities we have different sort of
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
concepts of definitions i guess this way
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would say it
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think added to the turmoil of covet
 
04:42:35.030 --> 04:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the quarantine rules we have been
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
distanced a little bit further
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i think we can solve this problem
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
quite quickly
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
but there are nuanced and important
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
practical differences between the
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
prison medical systems and the
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
university medical systems which i was
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
raised in
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just learning about these nuances
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
but tomorrow i have every belief this
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:04.470 --> 04:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
i believe our face-to-face discussions
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
the next few days will be comfortable uh
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'll and we will comfortably resolve
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
separate uh entities under so that
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
separate entities understand each other
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and practice
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
documents mr chairman and committee
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
members we believe that hb
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
1335 clearly updates and specifies the
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
present processes of medical parole
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
with more specific criteria for
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
consideration of medical parole
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
it clarifies rules of medical parole it
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
tracks and reviews medical parolees
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
it establishes up to date parole
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
conditions consistent with and recognize
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
changes as medical practices and is
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
based on best practice models
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it makes clear parole board
 
04:43:52.150 --> 04:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for medical parolees
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
risk assessment and monitoring while on
 
04:43:54.000 --> 04:43:55.270 align:start position:0%
risk assessment and monitoring while on
parole

04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
it also maintains
 
04:43:57.440 --> 04:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
it also maintains
the

04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
origin of the medical parole request
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
with the division of uh corrections
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
department of corrections within the
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
division of medical and forensic
 
04:44:06.480 --> 04:44:07.670 align:start position:0%
division of medical and forensic
services

04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
and again only applies to those parolees
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
who have not mentioned
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
sentences a representative of the new
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire adult parole board i ask your
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
forbearance we would like to have some
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
time to collaborate with the doc and
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
return to you with an amendment
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'll be meeting with the deputy director

forensics medical services this week and
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
hope to have an agreement ready for the
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration following that
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
for the amendment i would encourage you
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
in its reconciled and mutually supported
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
version i am happy to take any further
 
04:44:37.600 --> 04:44:44.150 align:start position:0%
version i am happy to take any further
questions

04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
you had made reference to uh
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
if a
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
medical parole was granted it would be a
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
house arrest
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
um so i mean house whether it's
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
in a hospice care building or a hospital
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
or your physical house is all
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's all considered house arrest yes
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
senior hands raise the witnesses excuse
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:45:24.310 --> 04:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

the committee now calls the honorable
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%

04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the medical parole
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
statute once
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
dr henriquez has had the opportunity to
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
go back and
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
work the
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
vocabulary issues the the meaning issues
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
of certain terms and certain principles
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
through with the department of
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%

the first part
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill is

nor the definition of the job
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:46:41.110 align:start position:0%
nor the definition of the job
the

04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%

term executive assistant
 
04:46:43.760 --> 04:46:44.750 align:start position:0%
term executive assistant
is

04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in its colloquial sense
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
and also i believe in its professional
 
04:46:50.718 --> 04:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
and also i believe in its professional
sense

04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the job that the person in
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
this role actually does and i do have um
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
of course a list of a variety of the
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
tasks that the person engages in in our
 
04:47:04.400 --> 04:47:05.830 align:start position:0%
tasks that the person engages in in our
office

04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you would like me to read those to
 
04:47:08.000 --> 04:47:10.470 align:start position:0%
if you would like me to read those to
you

04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the back page the last page of the
 
04:47:12.400 --> 04:47:14.310 align:start position:0%
on the back page the last page of the
bill

04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
it just follows that the name would be
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
amended to the director of operations
 
04:47:20.878 --> 04:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
amended to the director of operations
again

04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
we have a ceo coo type of model
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh in the parole office with me as the
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
chairman in the ceo ish role and the coo
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
role going to the director hopefully the
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
director of operations but now what is
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
named the executive assistant
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
that person really does direct all of
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
the internal operations how things are
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to precede how information comes
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
in all of the operations i do not direct
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
the operations i am the
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
policy and hearings procedure person but
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of all of the things that
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
happen in the parole office and there
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
are so many
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
that person our current executive
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
assistant jay mackey
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
does all of that so it is the most
 
04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate name for the person title
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
for the person in this position to be
 
04:48:27.750 --> 04:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
director of operations
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
and in that regard it is a
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
definitional technical change
 
04:48:37.110 --> 04:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
additionally we have in the center of um
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of under paragraph
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
the two paragraph simply cleans up
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
the membership and is more concise
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
two attorneys who are a member of the
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bar in good standing and
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
who are in in an active status
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have to maintain two attorneys on the
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
board because we have to always have an
 
04:49:07.590 --> 04:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
attorney at our parole revocation
 
04:49:07.600 --> 04:49:08.708 align:start position:0%
attorney at our parole revocation
hearings

04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
so since we have to have two in case
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
to switch off and in case one is not
 
04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
available to have the other there it
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
just makes sense to add two attorneys
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then say there are three additional
 
04:49:21.040 --> 04:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
and then say there are three additional
members

04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and take out
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
one at-large member
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
this change shortens things up and just
 
04:49:29.280 --> 04:49:30.230 align:start position:0%
this change shortens things up and just
cleans

04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
cleans
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
things up
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
and chairperson obviously the
 
04:49:33.680 --> 04:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
and chairperson obviously the
gender-neutral

04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
gender-neutral
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
because a chairperson is
 
04:49:43.760 --> 04:49:46.150 align:start position:0%
because a chairperson is
obviously

04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:49:50.310 --> 04:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.320 --> 04:49:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
non-binary

04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
non-binary
 
04:49:52.320 --> 04:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
non-binary
individual

04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so we think that it makes the most
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
sense to just have it explained in a
 
04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to offer on the
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
non-medical parts of the bill and i'm
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony seeing no
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls jeff stresslove
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
did i
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon my name is jeff
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
strozen i'm an associate attorney
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
general at the new hampshire attorney
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
we agree with the comments that you're
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to hear from the department of
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
corrections regarding this bill we think
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to consider the language
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill further and to study it
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
further before it's passed these are
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
very significant changes that are being
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
made to this bill
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that the bill
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
applies to any inmate regardless of the
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
number of victims that they've hurt or
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
killed the number of crimes they've
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
committed or how little of their
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
sentence they've actually served
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the way medical parole works if you have
 
04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who happens to be sick and they
 
04:51:05.270 --> 04:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
commit serious crimes or older when they
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
commit serious crimes they could
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
conceivably serve very little of their
 
04:51:10.868 --> 04:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
sentence and turn around and walk out
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
the door because they have medical
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
issues these are very difficult concepts
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
for victims to understand and it's very
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
hard on victims to find out that that
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
kind of consideration is being given to
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
people who victimized their family
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
members so we would just ask that you
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
consider the department of corrections
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
proposals and study this bill further
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
given that it has very far-reaching
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
consequences in cases
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i have and i'd be happy to
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:51:47.120 --> 04:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
my question
um

04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:48.160 --> 04:51:48.868 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're the right person
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.550 --> 04:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
criteria they use to grant medical
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions paroles now what's the
 
04:52:03.040 --> 04:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
exceptions paroles now what's the
difference

04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:52:06.550 --> 04:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
so this in our view is more expansive
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we think
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
if we're going to consider revamping
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
this bill we should consider other
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
aspects of it including the fact that
 
04:52:12.958 --> 04:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
aspects of it including the fact that
again

04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
it's without limitation so
 
04:52:18.788 --> 04:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
in most instances when an inmate tries
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
to leave prison for instance if someone
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
wants to suspend their sentence they
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
have to serve two-thirds of that
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
sentence this bill has no such
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
requirements or limitations
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you know not every
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
offender is of perfect health
 
04:52:34.550 --> 04:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
or necessarily young we have offenders
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
of different age groups different
 
04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
different health conditions
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
just because an offender is older or has
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
certain health conditions shouldn't mean
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
that they would escape the consequences
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
of their actions and there's no doubt
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that giving someone medical parole is
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
not the same as having that person be in
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
prison and i can tell you what
 
04:52:54.550 --> 04:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
family members have said to me is you
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
know my loved one didn't get to die
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
surrounded by friends or family
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
why does the person who killed my loved
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
one get to do that and obviously there
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
are other concepts here at work but that
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
is something that resonates with family
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
members and so we think it just makes
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
sense to consider the whole package
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
including that piece of it maybe it
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be that people would have to serve
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
a certain portion of their sentence
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
before they'd be eligible for medical
 
04:53:16.480 --> 04:53:17.590 align:start position:0%
before they'd be eligible for medical
parole

04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
because that's certainly how it is in
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
any other instance where an inmate would
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
get to leave prison early so we just
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
think this is an opportunity to consider
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
all that together
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh mr shelton i i think your your
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
points are very well taken on this uh
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
but let me add as as i read the language
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill as
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
currently proposed
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
a person would be eligible under this
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
language to be released on medical
 
04:53:45.840 --> 04:53:46.948 align:start position:0%
language to be released on medical
parole

04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:53:48.550 --> 04:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
even if
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
the condition the medical or
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
psychological condition that they suffer
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
from was one
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they had at the time of sentencing
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
and was known to the judge that was
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
pre-existing it was pre-existing
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
condition so they could
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
and and then the the other question may
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.400 --> 04:54:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
the um the language of the current law
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
as as i understand it
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
just talks about has a terminal
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
debilitating incapacity or incurable
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
medical condition or syndrome
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
and i note that in the permanently
 
04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
incapacitated section
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the new proposed language it talks
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
about not just a medical condition but a
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
mental condition and i'm wondering if
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
has the
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
current law been interpreted to allow
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
someone to be released because of a
 
04:54:36.878 --> 04:54:37.990 align:start position:0%
someone to be released because of a
mental

04:54:37.990 --> 04:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
mental
 
04:54:38.000 --> 04:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
mental
condition

04:54:39.430 --> 04:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i think
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections could
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
possibly have that answer i can tell you
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
that the most recent case i had
 
04:54:46.550 --> 04:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
concerning something like this had
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with a mental condition it
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
was purely a physical condition only so
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
i had
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge in our office we haven't
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
run into a request for medical parole
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
involving a mental condition
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
i mean it would strike me that that
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a much more dif much more
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
difficult issue
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of proof and things like that
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
it would and again you know not none of
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
us are perfect not every offender who
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
commits a crime is perfect
 
04:55:13.830 --> 04:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
this this is a significant avenue for
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
someone who may have committed some of
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
the most serious crimes that we have to
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
leave prison relatively early into their
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
sentence so again we just think this is
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to consider all those
 
04:55:25.750 --> 04:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
factors if we're going to significantly
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.550 --> 04:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
some of the conditions that are
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
explained here could they be handled in
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
the affirmary or the jail
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
i have spoken with uh people department
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
of corrections on on a case i had
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
recently and they did describe to me
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
their capabilities and again my guess is
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
that commissioner hanks could probably
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
answer those questions far better than i
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
can there's certainly some
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
again i'm not fully aware of their
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
complete capabilities though i apologize
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised the witness is
 
04:56:11.670 --> 04:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
excused thank you for your testimony
 
04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for letting me speak
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls commissioner
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon honorable chair members
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee helen hanks commissioner of
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections for the
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
record i thank you for the opportunity
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
to speak on the proposal before you
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
today and to triage some pre-existing
 
04:56:38.948 --> 04:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
questions and any follow-up questions
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
understandably our director of medical
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
and forensic services paul mattis did
 
04:56:44.550 --> 04:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
send her testimony in advance and i am
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
assured i know you will read and review
 
04:56:46.160 --> 04:56:47.350 align:start position:0%
assured i know you will read and review
that

04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns we had under the current
 
04:56:49.360 --> 04:56:50.470 align:start position:0%
the concerns we had under the current
proposal

04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
were the areas around a mental condition
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
and some other specificities that
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
ironically caused some vagaries and for
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
that matter with our experiencing
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
corrections we have individuals whom
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
have clear diagnosed medical conditions
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
that they're in the current formulation
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the law are high costs to the state
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire that are
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
high um
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
high utilization of our nursing
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
resources and become a challenge in the
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
environment and traditionally have been
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
terminal or debilitating in a way that
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
mitigates any risk to the community if
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
we find an appropriate health care
 
04:57:27.110 --> 04:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
setting that would take them and that
 
04:57:28.310 --> 04:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate health care setting
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
historically has been hospice care
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes nursing home setting and in
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
rare instances a home setting wrapping
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
hospice around that person because they
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
are eventually going to be terminal and
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
the age ranges have been from a young
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
person with terminal cancer to elderly
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
individuals with other comorbidities
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
associated with their care
 
04:57:49.830 --> 04:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
so we do appreciate the adult parole
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
board and we certainly were part of that
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
audit as referenced in 2019 and look
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
forward to moving
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
and resolving some of those things in an
 
04:58:00.390 --> 04:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
iteration of new reform of law under
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
your guidance obviously but we want to
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure we don't open the
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
door to
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who will actually intend to
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
abuse this law in an attempt to go home
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
be non-compliant with their mental
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
health care and i know this committee
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
knows the actual numbers of prevalence
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
of mental health and substance use
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
disorders and those incarcerated and i
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
know you wouldn't be surprised that some
 
04:58:22.948 --> 04:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
people would be non-compliant with their
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
treatment when in an attempt to
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
achieve medical parole and i as much as
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
having those requests come to my office
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
i want our time to be meaningful
 
04:58:33.280 --> 04:58:34.310 align:start position:0%
i want our time to be meaningful
together

04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:58:36.788 --> 04:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
so i certainly support working with any
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
members both of the adult parole board
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
this committee and the attorney
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
general's office on some mediated
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
language that reduces potential abuses
 
04:58:46.470 --> 04:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
but recognizes other
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
medical diagnoses such as dementia and
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's that could be
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
deferred to a community based setting
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
safely as long as the person's conduct
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
and course of behavior is not such that
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
it would be adverse to the other
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
patients in those settings so we
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate the progress that is
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
attempted in the iteration before you
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
but would ask
 
04:59:07.590 --> 04:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
the committee to create a subcommittee
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
so we could work on an amendment
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
together that would be more
 
04:59:11.360 --> 04:59:12.390 align:start position:0%
together that would be more
measured

04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
measured
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
balancing the concerns expressed in the
 
04:59:16.708 --> 04:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
testimony sent prior to today i'm sure
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
there were other key areas but again i
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to dwell into the testimony
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
too deeply i know you've read
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
it and again is it compassionate release
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
is it cost related release what what is
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
the state's intent in this update
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
because cost is completely excluded in
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
the proposal before you
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you the average cost of
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration is forty five thousand
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars right now um we generally and
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
historically have only put cases forward
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
that are significantly higher in cost
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
so with that i certainly am open to any
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have of
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
04:59:59.430 --> 04:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
my question is um regarding you know
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
there's a whole
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
a whole list of possible ailments and
 
05:00:02.878 --> 05:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
a whole list of possible ailments and
conditions

05:00:04.150 --> 05:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
how does the um the department deal with
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
chronic pain patients currently um that
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
require uh opioids or things of this
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
nature in the facility
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy thank you for that
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
question with regard to chronic care
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
associated with chronic pain
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
the treatment plan for those individuals
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be truly individualized
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
and balancing people's risk for opioid
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
addiction we will look for non-opioid
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
interventions to help that person plus
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
wrapping around mental health groups
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
managing your pain before it manages you
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
is a common group methodology we have a
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team that actually
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
vets and evaluates people with chronic
 
05:00:42.400 --> 05:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
vets and evaluates people with chronic
pain

05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
pain
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question because the
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
way the language is written that's a
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
debilitating condition that's not
 
05:00:51.910 --> 05:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
reversible in many cases
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
but if that came to my desk i wouldn't
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
be recommending them for medical parole
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
but i would have hundreds of individuals
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
who may attempt to seek medical parole
 
05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
how the department of corrections
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
handles inmates who need palliative care
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
or hospice care my guess is not all of
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
them are applying for for medical parole
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
representatives that's an excellent
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
question we actually created a hospice
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
program using residents who are trained
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
in um
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
call benign activities not health care
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
related activities and we actually
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
conduct hospice in our infirmary
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
settings for individuals who have not
 
05:01:38.948 --> 05:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
risen to the current statutory provision
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
for medical parole sometimes hospice is
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
rather sudden and sometimes we know in
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
advance and i do balance the voice of
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
victims involved in many of these cases
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
if i have an individual who's
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
incarcerated with and i have seen this
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
upwards of 10 counts of aggravated
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
felony sexual assault and we have a
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
terminal condition and that person needs
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
hospice i'm not likely to ask for
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
medical parole because the costs can be
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
actually contained within the current
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
budget of the agency under the current
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
algorithm and statute
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
i did some work for a lady that
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
it was a scarsdale diet murder
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
back in the late 80s or 90s
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
and she was the person that killed the
 
05:02:28.798 --> 05:02:29.910 align:start position:0%
and she was the person that killed the
guy

05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
guy
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
exemption like what we're talking here
 
05:02:36.240 --> 05:02:37.270 align:start position:0%
exemption like what we're talking here
today

05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
what would this bill do
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
with somebody like her
 
05:02:42.550 --> 05:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
that got better
 
05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
because she's out living in monroe new
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire and now she's uh i think she
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
has past sense but uh but
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know there was many years she got
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
better so what would this bill do if you
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
get better would they bring you back
 
05:02:57.750 --> 05:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative bert that was an
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
excellent question it's almost like you
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
read the 2019 audit because there was no
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
um there is a provision in the current
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
statute that says that the person is
 
05:03:05.600 --> 05:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
statute that says that the person is
better

05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
the adult parole board the first excuse
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
me field services our probation approval
 
05:03:12.550 --> 05:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
staff should tell the adult parole board
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
the person's better they don't meet the
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
criteria the statute and the adult
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
parole board would then have a hearing
 
05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
and then revoke the privilege of parole
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
and in that case scenario we have had
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
individuals whom did well under that
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
type of medical parole supervision and
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
the timing of their sentence actually
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
afforded the agency to put them out on
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's that was a specific
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
unique outlier associated with someone's
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
sentencing and serving that sentence
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
um on on page three of the bill it it
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
shows the the current language that's
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
lined out
 
05:04:00.310 --> 05:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it says all these conditions apply
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then starting on line 17 or 18 it
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
says it says the inmate falls into one
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
or more of the following categories and
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
then lists the filing categories that
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
have been testified to so far
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
could you just kind of give
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
your impression of
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
how the lined out version compares to
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
the lined inversion and what kind of
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
problems it might caught for you or and
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's maybe left in or not left in or
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be left in i know you're going
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
to have other discussions in some detail
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
but just kind of a 30 000 foot uh
 
05:04:32.080 --> 05:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
but just kind of a 30 000 foot uh
explanation

05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative newman
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
under the existing uh provisions cost is
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
a factor so again and i trust
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly the adult parole board's
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
research that many states have balanced
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
cost as a driver to medical parole with
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
compassionate release and and things of
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
that nature and i would defer those
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
decisions to the legislature and then i
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
would act on them so that is one obvious
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
um clear distinction in what's being
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
proposed today
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
the parts and the new proposals it's
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
really a new proposal that creates a
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
differentiation because it's clear right
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
now for the department that it's a
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
terminal debilitating
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
05:05:11.040 --> 05:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
medical condition
that

05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
that causes a reduction of risk so much
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
so that the person's not going to be a
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
threat in the community and that's in
 
05:05:19.600 --> 05:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
threat in the community and that's in
cost

05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
and then looking at the proposed
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
language using terms such as you see
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
before you mental condition mental
 
05:05:27.440 --> 05:05:28.868 align:start position:0%
before you mental condition mental
ability

05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
ability
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
things of that nature that creates a lot
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
of broadness for us with a large
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
prevalence of individuals with mental
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
illness and we just want to work on
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
refining those areas of the bill so that
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
we really are looking at individuals
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
whom and i will use dementia as an
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
example have dementia have needs that at
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
this point could be served better in a
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
health care setting outside of a
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
correctional environment rather than a
 
05:05:56.550 --> 05:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
person who has and as written
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would be challenged by people
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that they have a major
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
depressive disorder and they're not
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
compliant with their medications and
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's not reversible and
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think we can do this in a mitigated
 
05:06:09.910 --> 05:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
way to be successful in the intent thank
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witness is
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
05:06:48.958 --> 05:06:50.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
committee

05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
i can do zero to 60 eventually
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
i um
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
want to uh respond to some of the uh
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised attorney
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
stellson talked about
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
gee what if some really dangerous
 
05:07:06.718 --> 05:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
gee what if some really dangerous
criminal

05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
ask for medical parole
 
05:07:11.670 --> 05:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would remind you that under current
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
law there is no limit on who is eligible
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
is on page two you can see that it's
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
crossed out starting on line 10 the
 
05:07:23.360 --> 05:07:24.948 align:start position:0%
crossed out starting on line 10 the
criteria

05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
are on
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 15.
 
05:07:28.718 --> 05:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 15.
so

05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
even if you don't pass this that that
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that there is the
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
possibility that somebody who committed
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
a violent crime
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
who otherwise met the criteria
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
might be eligible for parole if they met
 
05:07:45.510 --> 05:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
all the other criteria
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:51.190 --> 05:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
as a former 10-year member of the parole
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
board i can tell you that medical
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't try to open the doors
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
it just tries to
 
05:08:04.080 --> 05:08:05.830 align:start position:0%
it just tries to
specify

05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
specify
 
05:08:05.840 --> 05:08:06.708 align:start position:0%
specify
uh

05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
with some detail
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
what the criteria are right now the
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
general terms terminal debilitating
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
incapacitating are incurable
 
05:08:16.638 --> 05:08:17.750 align:start position:0%
incapacitating are incurable
condition

05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that it's determined
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
that the cost of their care is
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
determined to be excessive
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
now for years the board has been trying
 
05:08:30.550 --> 05:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
to get a definition
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
of what's excessive cost
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
we would ask and they'd say well we know
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
that their drugs cost this much is that
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
excessive there was no definition
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
audit asked us
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
they dinged us on that
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
they said that you don't have any
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
definition of what what's excessive cost
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
and for years we have been trying to
 
05:08:53.910 --> 05:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
work with the department to develop
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
a definition of cost
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the reason that's in there
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
a person who is behind the walls and
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
needs medical care the state has to pay
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
for it if they're on medical parole
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
they go out on medicare medicaid
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
private insurance
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
so there's an incentive to get them out
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
the door because it's costing the state
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
too much
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
the way that that issue is addressed in
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is on page three line line
 
05:09:25.680 --> 05:09:26.788 align:start position:0%
the bill is on page three line line
three

05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
their care
 
05:09:33.430 --> 05:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
requires resources that exceed the
 
05:09:36.550 --> 05:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
department's medical capability
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
so and that's what's really driving this
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you can't provide it behind the walls
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
because it's too expensive
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
if you have somebody who's on dialysis
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:09:49.110 --> 05:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
is the cost of the dialysis is the cost
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
of a corrections officer who has to
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
accompany them two or three times a week
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
we were never able to get numbers on
 
05:09:59.430 --> 05:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
that so we we wanted to
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
address that issue in a general way by
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
that they require uh
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
treatment that
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and resources that exceed the
 
05:10:10.150 --> 05:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
department's medical capability
 
05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner uh and in the letter
 
05:10:12.400 --> 05:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner uh and in the letter
from

05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
paula mattis talked about the concern
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
about including mental conditions
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the board is very agreeable
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
to taking out any reference to the
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
mental conditions
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
that it was not our intent to expand
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility the intent of this bill is
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
to clearly define it and to set up a
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
process for tracking
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
them once they've been released
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
05:10:40.230 --> 05:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
noted that we
 
05:10:40.240 --> 05:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
noted that we
uh

05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
required some to report
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
back to us there that there any changes
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the medical edition every three
 
05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
months somewhere every six months
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether the reports came
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
back it wasn't clear who had to file
 
05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:58.480 --> 05:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
that's another reason that this bill is
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
better than the current law
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh and i remind you that any of these
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
medical paroles are initiated
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner's office
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
so if somebody is too
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
high profile too dangerous to
 
05:11:17.040 --> 05:11:19.030 align:start position:0%
high profile too dangerous to
whatever

05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:11:20.550 --> 05:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
we never even the parole board would
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
never even get to see it
 
05:11:22.958 --> 05:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
never even get to see it
um

05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
 
05:11:26.480 --> 05:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
somebody

05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:11:27.760 --> 05:11:28.628 align:start position:0%
somebody
who

05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
is released on medical parole and gets
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
the care they need and recovers
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
well the bill requires periodic reports
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
and if they no longer meet the criteria
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
for medical parole they come right back
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
to the prison
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
and as dr henrico said we recently had a
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
case like that
 
05:11:48.550 --> 05:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
where somebody was released to the
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
community was treated in the community
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
he got better
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
he came back to the prison
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
to complete
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
up to his minimum
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
and then he has a chance for a hearing
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
on a regular
 
05:12:01.120 --> 05:12:03.190 align:start position:0%
on a regular
parole

05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
parole
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i hope that uh
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
i uh would allow the stakeholders to sit
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
around the table and come up with an
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
agreeable amendment
 
05:12:15.510 --> 05:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
that satisfies
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
the specifics that the audit required
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
from the parole board and
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear about eligibility
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
and the process for tracking people
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
who are released on medical parole
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i would thank you for your attention
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
and take any questions you may have
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm curious
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
because you just mentioned that there
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
was a case
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
does the time while the person is out on
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
medical parole toll
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
against their
 
05:12:50.080 --> 05:12:50.868 align:start position:0%
against their
no

05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
the clock keeps running
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
and when they reach what would be their
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
minimum had they not been released on
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
medical parole
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
they are scheduled for a hearing for
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
regular parole
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
so somebody who was on medical parole
 
05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
who's still sick
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and didn't come back
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
meets the the date for his regular
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
parole he gets a hearing and we decide
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
whether he can continue where he is but
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
without those restrictions of medical
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
could you just elaborate a little bit
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
about um
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
a person who is released on medical
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
parole to an outside entity as opposed
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
to being cared for medically within the
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
institute the prison
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
who pays for that or how it's paid for
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
or who is required to pay for it
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
on the walls when they're behind the
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
walls the state is on the hook for the
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
complete cost of their care
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
if we release somebody
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
on medical parole who meets all the
 
05:13:55.030 --> 05:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
other criteria
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
and there are on medicare medicare we
 
05:13:57.760 --> 05:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
and there are on medicare medicare we
pay

05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
pay
 
05:14:01.270 --> 05:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
many of our
 
05:14:01.280 --> 05:14:02.628 align:start position:0%
many of our
inmates

05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
inmates
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
are eligible for medicaid
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
and we have released people who had
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
dr newman recognized for a follow-up
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:14:15.280 --> 05:14:16.628 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
and

05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
what would be the condition of what
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
would happen for somebody that just does
 
05:14:21.990 --> 05:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
not have access to medical
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
care onto any of the things that you
 
05:14:23.920 --> 05:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
care onto any of the things that you
mentioned

05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
well before they're released they have
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they have a place
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
that they can go to that will provide
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
the care
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have any funds and
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's no way to pay for it they're
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to have trouble finding a place
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
but if they if they
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
they can find a facility that will take
 
05:14:42.320 --> 05:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
they can find a facility that will take
them

05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
my question uh i'm just curious if um
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
do you have a view on whether there
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
should be some language in this that
 
05:14:58.638 --> 05:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
should be some language in this that
would

05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
require that the condition that provides
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
the basis for the potential parole
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
be one that that arose after the
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
sentencing because i guess my my concern
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have that then you could
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a situation where for example a
 
05:15:14.480 --> 05:15:15.510 align:start position:0%
have a situation where for example a
judge

05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
knowing all about the condition
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
nonetheless decided let's say that
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
someone should should receive a 10-year
 
05:15:21.520 --> 05:15:22.628 align:start position:0%
someone should should receive a 10-year
sentence

05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know almost immediately the the
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
person could apply for medical parole
 
05:15:28.948 --> 05:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
and the parole board
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
could essentially
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know undo what the judge did by
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying no we think the person should be
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
should be paroled
 
05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
well the parole but only considers it if
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of corrections
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
recommends it
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
and there there is no limit on
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
how long they've been in they i mean
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
attorney strauss and talked about other
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
areas where sentences are modified after
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
we never considered that
 
05:16:05.350 --> 05:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
05:16:07.830 --> 05:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
it is so rare
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
i've been on the board i've just
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
completed 10 years on the board and
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
there was never a situation like that i
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
think in the 10 years maybe i've seen
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 medical girls
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
so it's very rare and those kind of
 
05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
scenarios are nothing i've ever seen

representative pratt
 
05:16:33.520 --> 05:16:35.670 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
hello

05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
hello
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
earlier we've talked about mental health
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that's going to get worked on but is
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
it possible a serious mental health
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
person could end up in a nursing home
 
05:16:47.750 --> 05:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
for medical medicaid medicare to take
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
and they would be in a nursing home with
 
05:16:53.110 --> 05:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
regulations about mental health is that
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
the department has the capacity to deal
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
with mental health that we have a secure
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit
 
05:17:00.000 --> 05:17:01.910 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit
so

05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
i would say that the board is very
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
receptive to the idea of eliminating any
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the concerns
 
05:17:10.560 --> 05:17:11.910 align:start position:0%
of the concerns
about

05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
broadening the application of this by
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
applying it to mental health conditions
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
nice seeing no hands raised
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you for your testimony and
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.708 --> 05:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
president who wish to testify that have
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%

this just to be clear just to be
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarified with members of the committee
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
last year i know we've we've heard a lot
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i've received a lot of comments
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
already and a lot of communications both
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
in support and uh in opposition to
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh hb 1105.
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.440 --> 05:20:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
22-a

05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
22-a
 
05:20:56.230 --> 05:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
there are various programs that someone
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
an inmate can complete in order to
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
reduce time off their sentence
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
we've over the years have expanded that
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
list it includes getting a high school
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
diploma you can get a bachelor's degree
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
even a master's degree
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's vocational programs there's
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
participation in family connection
 
05:21:12.718 --> 05:21:14.628 align:start position:0%
participation in family connection
programs

05:21:14.628 --> 05:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
and a lot there's also on-the-job
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
training that they can receive and
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
in any any inmate is eligible to receive
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
up to 21 months off their sentence
 
05:21:26.000 --> 05:21:26.788 align:start position:0%
up to 21 months off their sentence
what

05:21:26.788 --> 05:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1105 focuses on is
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
simply subsection f which does exclude
 
05:21:34.708 --> 05:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
sections a through e
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
that which i just discussed
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
and what that section would apply to it
 
05:21:42.150 --> 05:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
really allows it's kind of a catch-all
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
section where really any program that's
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
approved by the commissioner could be
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
an inmate to be eligible for up 60 days
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
off their sentence
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
it can be used an unlimited amount of
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
times up until the point at least they
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
reach the 21 months
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
and although i don't have an any issue
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
with the underlying policy
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
under subsection f itself
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
there was no limitation or otherwise
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
criteria for what any program would be
 
05:22:11.430 --> 05:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
and how that would actually
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm not upset
 
05:22:25.040 --> 05:22:26.070 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm not upset
but

05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
i what i looked at is and please don't
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
mistake my testimony or the intent my
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
intentions i'm not in any way implying
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the current policy under subsection
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
f is being misused or misapplied
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
my concern is simply that it is
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
something that without any criteria what
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
would really qualify
 
05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
in you know in terms of the curriculum
 
05:22:47.830 --> 05:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
how many hours that the program would be
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that it there could be
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
people would raise questions about
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
whether that program was sufficient
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
so i thought it was worth
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
at least the time being to put a
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
limitation on the catch-all provision by
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
limited limiting it to a single
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility for a single time use
 
05:23:06.548 --> 05:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
similar how you if you got a your high
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
school diploma you couldn't get more
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
than one
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
and under subsection a so therefore you
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
are limited to one time use
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.990 --> 05:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
there being none
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
oh well there's one there you go all
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
right represent true
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
look looking at section
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
f which is what your bill
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
05:23:41.910 --> 05:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
for that program that section f is
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
you could only get a
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
one no matter how many you completed you
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
could only get one 60 day off
 
05:23:51.040 --> 05:23:52.948 align:start position:0%
could only get one 60 day off
program

05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question as written
 
05:23:57.030 --> 05:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the current law
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
a person can complete the program
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
by my math it was ten and a half times
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
each time they they complete it
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
they would get be eligible for six they
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
would get 60 days off their sentence
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
so what i'm trying what i'm explaining
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is no criteria
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
of how that program makes you eligible
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
other than it's approved by the
 
05:24:19.120 --> 05:24:20.708 align:start position:0%
other than it's approved by the
commissioner

05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:24:20.718 --> 05:24:21.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
guidance beyond that point but you can
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
keep repeating that program up until you
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:33.110 --> 05:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
and what the bill would do would mean
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
you only could complete the catch-all
 
05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
provision one time and receive just a
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
single 60 days off your sentence you can
 
05:24:39.600 --> 05:24:40.470 align:start position:0%
single 60 days off your sentence you can
keep

05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
re-entering a different taking a
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
different program one after another and
 
05:24:46.708 --> 05:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
continuing reducing your sentence
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
had said the
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
your reason for submitting the bill was
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of qualifying
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
criteria in the current statute
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
but what your bill appears to do is to
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
just limit the amount of credits as
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to actually changing the
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
criteria would changing the criteria be
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
another way to address this
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
without without having a spec a clear
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
criteria of what would qualify under the
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
catch-all provision
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh to me limiting the the amount of
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
times it's applied was i thought the
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
best course to go because
 
05:25:34.230 --> 05:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
what i believe is an appropriate
 
05:25:34.240 --> 05:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
what i believe is an appropriate
criteria

05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
i can imagine and i love working with
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee but i know we
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
may have all different opinions on that
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
but if you if the criteria was really
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
specific i don't think there would be as
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
much of a motivation to
 
05:25:51.190 --> 05:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
reduce at least to one time i mean maybe
 
05:25:52.708 --> 05:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
it would be two or three times that they
 
05:25:54.628 --> 05:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
can be eligible which might be a
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
reasonable but having a criteria for i
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
think would benefit
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
would benefit the the concern that i
 
05:26:00.400 --> 05:26:06.470 align:start position:0%
would benefit the the concern that i
have

05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:06.480 --> 05:26:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that i'm i'm
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
curious about too are the the types of
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
programming uh that are currently
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
offered as part of this this catch-all
 
05:26:15.280 --> 05:26:16.230 align:start position:0%
offered as part of this this catch-all
so

05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:16.240 --> 05:26:17.270 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh you know what's offered
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
what the advantages of of taking it are
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
and if there are advantages
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
to completing multiple programs instead
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
of just one
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh from the perspective i guess of both
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
the doc and the uh
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
and the resident
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question in in some
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances and assuming that the
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
programs that we're i'm speaking of
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't fall under subsections a through e
 
05:26:42.000 --> 05:26:42.948 align:start position:0%
don't fall under subsections a through e
which

05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
cut does cover a lot of ground
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
and and this is part of the problem with
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
creating a criteria without knowing
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of a catch-all without
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
knowing what the program is it's really
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
hard to articulate what the criteria
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
would be so think of like if you're
 
05:26:58.548 --> 05:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
getting your real estate license there's
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of hours in the course
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
you have to take in order to complete
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
the program i'm just saying without as
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
written now
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's not really clear i just don't know
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
without knowing what the program is it's
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
hard to actually put that all together
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the concerns i have as
 
05:27:14.240 --> 05:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the concerns i have as
well

05:27:15.110 --> 05:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.150 --> 05:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sheriff thank you for taking
 
05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:27:27.360 --> 05:27:28.150 align:start position:0%
my question
so

05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'll go back and and read because i love
 
05:27:33.510 --> 05:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
the read
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
oh good um
 
05:27:35.440 --> 05:27:36.310 align:start position:0%
oh good um
but

05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
it says here in an f
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
a prisoner who
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
meaningfully participates in any program
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is authorized and approved by the
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
department that the commissioner
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
deems to be valuable so someone is
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
making an evaluation that
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can trust and that is the
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner corrections and i'm sure
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of corrections is
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
not going to approve
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
a program
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly for the same person unless
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting something from it
 
05:28:11.600 --> 05:28:12.628 align:start position:0%
they're getting something from it
so

05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:16.548 --> 05:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh and first
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
of all i wouldn't file a bill unless i
 
05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
thought it was necessary
 
05:28:24.548 --> 05:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
but with that being said there is a the
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
criteria for what the commissioner would
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate is that they believe it will
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
meaningfully assist the person the
 
05:28:32.548 --> 05:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
inmate in rehabilitation
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is that there's no
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing actually articulating
 
05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
though what
 
05:28:40.548 --> 05:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
the in-depth of that program is
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's course hours
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
and for them for a person to be able to
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
get 21 months off their sentence i mean
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
in theory they could take a attend a
 
05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
lecture on a iphone or
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
an electronic device that's 20 minutes
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
long and that could satisfy now i'm not
 
05:28:58.948 --> 05:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that that's happening
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
frequently but it certainly is a concern
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
that could happen in the future and
 
05:29:03.830 --> 05:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
again i'm not suggesting that it's
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
currently being taken advantage of but
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like something worth
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:12.718 --> 05:29:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:18.070 --> 05:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
so what right now we are
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
relying on the judgment of the
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of corrections to evaluate
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
whether it is a valuable for the real
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
reputation of prisoners just like we uh
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
value the
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
judgment of judges on assigning
 
05:29:35.920 --> 05:29:38.230 align:start position:0%
judgment of judges on assigning
sentences

05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
05:29:43.110 --> 05:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
relying on the judgment of the
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner of corrections
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
well i
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i certainly
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't think you should take all the
 
05:29:51.270 --> 05:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
discretion away from the commissioner
 
05:29:51.280 --> 05:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
discretion away from the commissioner
especially

05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
especially
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't see any
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
any reason why the commission wouldn't
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
be involved in this process throughout
 
05:29:58.548 --> 05:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
the you know whether it's a through f
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
altogether i think the commissioner's
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
obviously going to play an active role
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in that but like judges we create
 
05:30:04.080 --> 05:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
in that but like judges we create
sentences

05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's sentencing criteria but we when
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation and create a penalty
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes limitations on what
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that sentence can be whether it's
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
shortening a term or making it a life
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
sentence or even
 
05:30:20.708 --> 05:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
beyond that when it comes to fines it's
 
05:30:22.150 --> 05:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
issue the judge sometimes has the
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
discretion to waive a fine reduce the
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
fine it could be a fine up to a certain
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
amount so there is a lot of discretion
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
that can be taken into place
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
but in with in this scenario i'm just
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
explaining that there really is
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
no set criteria to for someone who's
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
been convicted of a crime to be able to
 
05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
reduce their sentence by 21 months
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
i would just think that there would be
 
05:30:44.470 --> 05:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
some structure to especially with the
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
catch-all provision because that seems
 
05:30:47.190 --> 05:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
to be more
 
05:30:47.200 --> 05:30:48.708 align:start position:0%
to be more
um

05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's less directed at a specific topic
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
like some of the what you see in
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:31:00.150 --> 05:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and members of
 
05:31:22.628 --> 05:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is pamela keilig
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i am the public policy specialist at
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire coalition against
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence the
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
coalition is the umbrella organization
 
05:31:32.548 --> 05:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community-based crisis
 
05:31:32.558 --> 05:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community-based crisis
centers

05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
centers
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
who provide free and confidential
 
05:31:37.750 --> 05:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
services to nearly 15 000 victims of
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence each year
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm here in support of hb 1105 which
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
05:31:47.190 --> 05:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
guidance on the number of applications
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
submitted for earn time credits in new
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire correctional facilities as it
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
pertains to the other programs category
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for being nervous
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
this bill makes a simple yet important
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to the number of applications
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
that an inmate can submit to receive
 
05:32:06.788 --> 05:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
earn time credit within the other
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
programs category
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
as an organization that advocates on
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
behalf of victims of crime in this state
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
we see this change as necessary to
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the balance is maintained
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice system that
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
meaningful rehabilitation and community
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
justice can take place
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
the change will not restrict the
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities for incarcerated
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
individuals to participate in
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative programming
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
but instead we'll insert an important
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
guardrail to limit any insincere use of
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
this well-intentioned program
 
05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
just to give you some background of what
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the last couple of years
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
the pandemic opened up online
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
programming making programs more readily
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
available and being completed at a much
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
more rapid rate while this was a
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessary change given the circumstances
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
it has also had unintended consequences
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
including a flood of applications under
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
this other program's category that we
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
are addressing today as the earn time
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
credit program is implemented now these
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
applications are being submitted at a
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
frequency that has had negative impacts
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
on victims and their families
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
especially around their mental health
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
and their safety
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just really important
 
05:33:16.548 --> 05:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
that we all whenever we're making these
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
decisions that we're considering victim
 
05:33:18.638 --> 05:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
decisions that we're considering victim
input

05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
input
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors in new hampshire
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
have experienced some of the most
 
05:33:26.070 --> 05:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
unthinkable and traumatizing events
 
05:33:28.150 --> 05:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
the nature of domestic and sexual
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
violence is deeply personal where the
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
offender intentionally uses forms of
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
abuse to maintain power and control over
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
another individual
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this abuse continues
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
throughout a victim's engagement with
 
05:33:42.390 --> 05:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i want to just note that we are
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly grateful for the work of the
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
department of justice's victim witness
 
05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
assistance unit and victim services at
 
05:33:51.910 --> 05:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections who
 
05:33:53.750 --> 05:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
provide critical support to crime
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
victims and their families
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
these services help ensure that criminal
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
justice system minimizes further harm
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
through these supportive services
 
05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
this is important because i think it's
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
we really need to remember that behind
 
05:34:07.120 --> 05:34:08.708 align:start position:0%
we really need to remember that behind
every

05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
person going through these
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative programs is a victim or a
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
family of victims that are trying to
 
05:34:13.920 --> 05:34:15.270 align:start position:0%
family of victims that are trying to
heal

05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
heal
 
05:34:17.350 --> 05:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
and to kind of further illustrate this
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
according to the department of
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
corrections website victim services
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
staff documented over 9 000 contacts
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
with more than 3800 victim survivors and
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
their families in 2017
 
05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
that's the most recent data i could find
 
05:34:33.990 --> 05:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
and there were also 351 new requests for
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
victim notification during that fiscal
 
05:34:35.920 --> 05:34:36.948 align:start position:0%
victim notification during that fiscal
year

05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
so victims can remain heavily involved
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice process long
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
after the trial occurs
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
we hear from countless victims victims
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
families and
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
service victim service providers about
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
the ongoing trauma that victims
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
experience even after a person who has
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
harmed them has been incarcerated and
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
this can take on many forms one of that
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
is being notified that their abuser has
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
received earned time credit which
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
lessens their sentence and often makes
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
them eligible for parole long before
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone even anticipated that happening
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
when a victim chooses to engage in the
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system as a way to hold
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
their abuser accountable they are
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
seeking safety security and a sense of
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
closure this is immediately disrupted
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
when a victim or their family learns
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
that the abuser has had a reduction to
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
their sentence
 
05:35:25.270 --> 05:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
which can be extremely painful
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
stress-inducing and re-traumatizing
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
i say this all just with
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
in context of this bill
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
that an inmate's rehabilitation cannot
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
occur in isolation it should be in
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
response to and acknowledging the
 
05:35:39.990 --> 05:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
particular harm that was created through
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
an effort to learn from and move beyond
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
that incident but it requires mutual
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
understanding as well as recognition
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
that harm was committed in the first
 
05:35:48.400 --> 05:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
that harm was committed in the first
place

05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
this bill really helps maintain that by
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
establishing guidelines that balance the
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for inmates to apply for
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
in time while also ensuring that victims
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
are granted the space to heal and have
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
their safe and not have their safety
 
05:36:02.718 --> 05:36:04.070 align:start position:0%
their safe and not have their safety
jeopardized

05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
jeopardized

bill

05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
i want to just thank you ahead of time
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony my goal here
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
today is for you to hear
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
the victim side and to see this bill
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
from that lens
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
so at the victim services unit we do
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
strive to empower victims support them
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
and provide them with information
 
05:37:21.270 --> 05:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
pertaining to their case
 
05:37:23.430 --> 05:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
as they interface the criminal justice
 
05:37:23.440 --> 05:37:24.868 align:start position:0%
as they interface the criminal justice
system

05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
so every year we are providing thousands
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
of notifications to victims of crime on
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
case status
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
whether that be about a transfer to
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
another facility or as a resident
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
transfers out of the prison system a lot
 
05:37:38.788 --> 05:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
of our notifications do revolve around
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
earn time credit because it is impacting
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
the resident sentence
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
earned time credit is one of those
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
types of notifications that we provide
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
multiple on a weekly level
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i want to share how that has
 
05:37:54.868 --> 05:37:54.878 align:start position:0%
impacted victims today so just to give
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
you a background or just to give you a
 
05:37:58.150 --> 05:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of context with how those
 
05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
notifications go out so when a resident
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
applies for earn time credit within the
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of corrections
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that is approved by the commissioner
 
05:38:07.110 --> 05:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
of corrections or denied by the
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner my office receives that
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
notification and then we provide that
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
notification to the victim who is signed
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
up to receive notification from my
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
office so a notice will go out at that
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
time so we will be informing a victim
 
05:38:19.920 --> 05:38:20.708 align:start position:0%
time so we will be informing a victim
that

05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:21.910 --> 05:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
a the
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
application was approved and this is the
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
sentence reduction
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
or it's denied or it's approved and now
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
the offender now has to submit a motion
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
receiving those notifications or
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
multiple notifications on earntime
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
credit as you can imagine can be
 
05:38:38.480 --> 05:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
credit as you can imagine can be
disheartening

05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
disheartening
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
and re-traumatizing for victims and
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's what i really want to hone in on
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
today is that re-traumatization that
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
this can cause
 
05:38:48.150 --> 05:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
and today you'll hear firsthand and
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully you all receive some testimony
 
05:38:52.470 --> 05:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
from victims as well who will
 
05:38:54.230 --> 05:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
articulate very well how earn time
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
credit has impacted them and how it has
 
05:38:58.390 --> 05:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
been has been re-traumatizing
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
um and one thing to note is how it can
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
certainly have an impact on
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
their healing process so whether that
 
05:39:08.070 --> 05:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
halts their healing process or
 
05:39:10.470 --> 05:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
makes them take step back in their
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
healing process
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make a few points
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
like pamela already said it's really
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge that
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the victims have already been through a
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
very traumatizing experience just having
 
05:39:22.240 --> 05:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
very traumatizing experience just having
been

05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
a victim of crime having to go through
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
the rigorous criminal conviction process
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
and then start to understand
 
05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
post-conviction and then to be faced
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
with the realities of earn time credit
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
and sentences being reduced up to 21
 
05:39:39.910 --> 05:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
months for an offender's
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative efforts to get time off
 
05:39:42.160 --> 05:39:43.190 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative efforts to get time off
and

05:39:43.190 --> 05:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully correct some of their behavior
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when an offender is
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
sentenced that gives
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
the victim time to heal in time to
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
allow themselves space to feel safe and
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
to work towards full healing
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
so when earned time credit is granted
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
that can often compromise that
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
additionally with earned time credits um
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
this can result in a victim not just
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
being informed about the process but
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
having to talk to multiple advocates at
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
my office at prosecution the prosecutor
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes having to go back and
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
relive their trauma in a court room
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
so some other victim related concerns
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
that i want to point out quickly
 
05:40:32.628 --> 05:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times earn time credit was
 
05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
not part of the underlying sentencing or
 
05:40:36.788 --> 05:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
plea agreement if the resident was
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
sentenced prior to september 2014 that
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
would not have been part of the
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
sentencing so a victim would not
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily have agreed to those terms
 
05:40:46.470 --> 05:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from the victim today who
 
05:40:48.150 --> 05:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
that was the case
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
that was not an agreed term
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
so then an offender can do the treatment
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
get the earn time credit and then they
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to motion the court to then go
 
05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
before a judge to have it either granted
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
or denied
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
so the victim who never agreed to it now
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
has to go back to court to either give
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
input or talk to prosecution about what
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
their options are in giving input and
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
possibly living with the reality of earn
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
time credit being granted regardless of
 
05:41:16.470 --> 05:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
and then earn time credit can be
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
added in addition to
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
already time suspended for
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
other programs completed so
 
05:41:26.070 --> 05:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
if a sex offender for instance was
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
granted two and a half years off of
 
05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
their term for sex offender treatment
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
they can still apply for earn time
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
credit for behavioral health services as
 
05:41:32.878 --> 05:41:34.628 align:start position:0%
credit for behavioral health services as
well

05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
there is also the other program's
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
expansion from legislation in 2020
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
this definitely
 
05:41:43.830 --> 05:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
created an influx in the other category
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
other programs category where multiple
 
05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
residents were applying i think pamela
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to that as well and then the
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
other part i really want to hone in on
 
05:41:53.040 --> 05:41:54.070 align:start position:0%
other part i really want to hone in on
is

05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the level of safety and i've touched
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
based on this a couple times but just to
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
go a little bit deeper
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
so when earn time credit is granted say
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is granted to the full 21 months off
 
05:42:05.590 --> 05:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
of a minimum and maximum oftentimes as
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
part of sentencing whereas part of
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
parole conditions a victim can request
 
05:42:09.120 --> 05:42:10.310 align:start position:0%
parole conditions a victim can request
time

05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:42:12.788 --> 05:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
can request for no contact orders or
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
travel conditions so when earned time
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
credit is granted and those sentences
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
are reduced we're actually reducing
 
05:42:21.750 --> 05:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
certain levels of safety with no contact
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
orders or travel conditions that could
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
be in place for longer but are actually
 
05:42:33.510 --> 05:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's where i will
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
move on from and kind of come to a
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion at this point i don't want to
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
take too much of your time um but in
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion i don't think that victims
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
are necessarily against the
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative intent of earnt time
 
05:42:48.638 --> 05:42:49.590 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative intent of earnt time
credit

05:42:49.590 --> 05:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
in fact i have worked with plenty of
 
05:42:52.470 --> 05:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
victims who have been in support of
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
earned time credit and their offender
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
getting the rehabilitative services that
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
really are necessary for them to be
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
productive members of society
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
i think what it comes down to is
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
weighing and balancing the victims level
 
05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
of safety and their input with the
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation of the resident who is
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and that's really what i
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to present to you all today
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
and if you have any other questions or
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions for me i'm happy to answer and
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate the time that you've
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
given me to um speak and hear from the
 
05:43:24.628 --> 05:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
victim services lens of things regarding
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
secretary thank you for taking my
 
05:43:32.958 --> 05:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
secretary thank you for taking my
question

05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:34.080 --> 05:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that notifications from
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
to the victims
 
05:43:40.958 --> 05:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
to the victims
from

05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
the prison concerning uh things that
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
have changed in
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
the uh inmate
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh seemed to
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
traumatize the victim again and it i'm
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
these notifications of which i've just
 
05:43:58.000 --> 05:43:58.868 align:start position:0%
these notifications of which i've just
heard

05:43:58.868 --> 05:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
people have signed up for
 
05:44:02.470 --> 05:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
is really
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
such a great idea
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your question
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
it is their right to have notification
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
and to be kept aware of the resident's
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
status so it is it is part of their
 
05:44:17.670 --> 05:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
healing process oftentimes to be
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
informed and involved and to have input
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
there is another program
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:34.150 --> 05:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
earn time off for good conduct do
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
victims get
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
notification of those credits as well
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your question
 
05:44:44.070 --> 05:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
again are you referencing the 150 days
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
that they receive
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
as part of their sentencing structure
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm referencing credits for good conduct
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
51 8 22
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half days a month for good
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
contact conduct
 
05:45:04.470 --> 05:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
good conduct a month we do not provide
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
notification on that no all right thank
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
05:45:13.270 --> 05:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for taking the
 
05:45:13.280 --> 05:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for taking the
question

05:45:14.470 --> 05:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
forgive me if this was
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
clear to others in your testimony but is
 
05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
your concern
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of total time that could be
 
05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
earned or is it the fact that anyone
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
could earn any time credit at all
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
um it's not
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not opposed to the amount of
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
earned time credit that can be given the
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
21 months
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think it goes back to the amount that
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
is being applied for under the other
 
05:45:41.680 --> 05:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
is being applied for under the other
category

05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
category
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question and just to
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
show the impact that it has on victims
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
there be no oh there's one more
 
05:45:54.080 --> 05:45:58.708 align:start position:0%
there be no oh there's one more
representative

05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.718 --> 05:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
one thing i
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm kind of a little curious about
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
is how the notification comes to victims
 
05:46:06.638 --> 05:46:07.350 align:start position:0%
is how the notification comes to victims
so

05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:07.360 --> 05:46:08.788 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
i was a victim in a credit card case and
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
i get notifications from the department
 
05:46:15.110 --> 05:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
of justice and there
 
05:46:17.830 --> 05:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
about the status of the trials of the
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
people of whether or not they were
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
imprisoned when they'll be getting out
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're very short they're very clinical
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're a little scary
 
05:46:28.000 --> 05:46:28.708 align:start position:0%
they're a little scary
and

05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering is
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
is the problem the earned income credits
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
or is it the way that these
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
notifications happen is there
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
is there a better way of setting
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
expectations maybe with victims that
 
05:46:42.628 --> 05:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
this is part of the process and this is
 
05:46:42.638 --> 05:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
this is part of the process and this is
something

05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they should
 
05:46:45.600 --> 05:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
maybe they should
expect

05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
expect
 
05:46:48.948 --> 05:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
be alarmed about
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
05:46:57.510 --> 05:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
i guess to answer a couple of your
 
05:46:59.430 --> 05:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions that i don't think there's any
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
perfect system for notifying a victim of
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
any change of status i do think that our
 
05:47:05.030 --> 05:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
letters are very
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
as best as we can victim responsive and
 
05:47:07.680 --> 05:47:08.868 align:start position:0%
as best as we can victim responsive and
sensitive

05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
we try to provide them as much
 
05:47:14.310 --> 05:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
information and education as possible
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and we have tried to do a lot of
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
education to prosecution
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
around earn time credit just so that
 
05:47:22.948 --> 05:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
they are aware how many sentences are
 
05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
being impacted so that victims can be
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
properly educated on earn time credit
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
and again we are doing education as best
 
05:47:33.830 --> 05:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
as we can we've created
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
a sheet that we hand out to victims as
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
soon as we get an earn time credit
 
05:47:39.510 --> 05:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
application so that they can be aware
 
05:47:41.910 --> 05:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
and see firsthand what a resident can
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
get earn time credit for and how it
 
05:47:43.440 --> 05:47:45.270 align:start position:0%
get earn time credit for and how it
works

05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
works
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
but i do appreciate your feedback on
 
05:47:47.120 --> 05:47:48.788 align:start position:0%
but i do appreciate your feedback on
that

05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
if i could ask a question um just so the
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee has kind of an
 
05:47:53.280 --> 05:47:55.190 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee has kind of an
idea

05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
your office doesn't
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't handle um
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
credit card fraud for for lack of a
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
better term could you give us an example
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
of some of the crimes that the victims
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
are suffering from sure um thank you for
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the question we provide notification and
 
05:48:14.070 --> 05:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
services to any felony level survivor of
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
crime so whether that's identity theft
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
burglaries robberies homicides
 
05:48:23.110 --> 05:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
death resulting from drug overdose
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and domestic violence any
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
felony level crime where someone is
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the victim of that crime

can sign up for our services
so

05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:35.430 --> 05:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
under identity theft that could actually
 
05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
involve credit card correct if that
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
included uh

delaney is pretty much what happened
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'll sum it up real quick essentially um
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
back in april of 20 2013
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
all on patrol and encounter with an
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
individual during a car stop
 
05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
um it's an individual provide fake
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
identity ultimately fled on foot
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the stop while chasing this person
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
as i closed in to grab him and take him
 
05:50:08.470 --> 05:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
into custody he turned on me and fired
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
at me with a handgun
 
05:50:10.638 --> 05:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
at me with a handgun
um

05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know the encounter being so close
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
that my uniform was burned from the
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
gunpowder discharge
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
you could feel the heat on my face
 
05:50:23.910 --> 05:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
i lost my hearing i had eyesight
 
05:50:23.920 --> 05:50:24.788 align:start position:0%
i lost my hearing i had eyesight
problems

05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
after exchange of gunfire the foot chase
 
05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
continued i eventually caught up to this
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
person arrested him
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
it was only afterwards that we found out
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
the scope of the criminality this
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
individual had been involved in
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
that particular day he was in possession
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
of not one but three fully loaded
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
semiotic handguns that he was using to
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know insulate and protect his uh
 
05:50:46.558 --> 05:50:47.830 align:start position:0%
you know insulate and protect his uh
criminality

05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
criminality
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
he was in possession of hundreds of
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
oxycodone tablets which
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
eventually transformed into what we're
 
05:50:55.910 --> 05:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
seeing now with the heron and the
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
fentanyl epidemic
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
he was uh already inserted into the
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
department of corrections i was on
 
05:51:04.470 --> 05:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
probation however he was listed as a
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
fugitive uh because he just decided that
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
he was going to obey the terms of his
 
05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:09.110 align:start position:0%
he was going to obey the terms of his
probation

05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
probation
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
and they kind of lost track of him
 
05:51:13.510 --> 05:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know due to his efforts to be
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
not seen or heard from um at any rate
 
05:51:18.150 --> 05:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know he faced
 
05:51:19.750 --> 05:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know several felony charges that day
 
05:51:20.788 --> 05:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
obviously the most serious being
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
attempted murder of a police officer
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
this person would go to court and
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately plead guilty to all those
 
05:51:27.200 --> 05:51:28.230 align:start position:0%
ultimately plead guilty to all those
charges

05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
charges
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
it was sentenced to 20 to 80 years at
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state prison
 
05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
as a victim of the crime i was in
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with his plan sensing
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the condition that he
 
05:51:39.440 --> 05:51:40.390 align:start position:0%
on the condition that he
waved

05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
waved
 
05:51:44.150 --> 05:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
any ability to reduce his sentence so
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the simplest terms there was nothing
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that he could do
 
05:51:49.830 --> 05:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
the day of his plan sensing
 
05:51:51.510 --> 05:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
that he could do once in prison to
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
reduce spending every day of the 20
 
05:51:56.230 --> 05:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
years incarcerated nor could he do
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
anything to reduce the remainder
 
05:52:02.310 --> 05:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the 80 years once out on parole so he
 
05:52:04.390 --> 05:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
was to do all that time within the
 
05:52:06.948 --> 05:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
correctional system
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
fast forward um to 2014 you had the
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
and essentially it threw this young man
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
a lifeline in terms of a sentence
 
05:52:20.788 --> 05:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
reduction so all he had to do basically
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
for the rsa as you know is get
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
permission from
 
05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of corrections and then
 
05:52:28.470 --> 05:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
perform the courses and then once
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
completed he would have to petition the
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
court um to have that applied to a
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
sentence so currently uh this individual
 
05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
from every right has accrued 180 days
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
worth of earned time credits under that
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
statute he's petitioned the court of
 
05:52:44.390 --> 05:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
course i objected and now where um that
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
matters before the court hasn't been
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
decided yet so i anticipate there'll be
 
05:52:47.440 --> 05:52:48.788 align:start position:0%
decided yet so i anticipate there'll be
hearings

05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
05:52:50.628 --> 05:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth with respect to
 
05:52:50.638 --> 05:52:51.510 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth with respect to
that

05:52:51.510 --> 05:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the um house bill 1105
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're here for today
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm obviously in support of the changes
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
that would make uh regarding the um
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know the special courses or the the
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
other courses in terms of the unlimited
 
05:53:08.948 --> 05:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
amount of time currently that inmates
 
05:53:12.150 --> 05:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
can get um i see no reason why they
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
should be afforded the opportunity to
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
get unlimited credit for
 
05:53:19.990 --> 05:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
um you know right now unspecified
 
05:53:21.750 --> 05:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
courses um as someone mentioned they
 
05:53:23.990 --> 05:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
could essentially accrue the 21 months
 
05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
maximum time under that uh portion of
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:53:27.520 --> 05:53:28.470 align:start position:0%
the law
um

05:53:28.470 --> 05:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:30.150 --> 05:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know whereas obviously the bill
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
today would limit that to 60 days
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
which you know i think is appropriate
 
05:53:35.440 --> 05:53:37.190 align:start position:0%
which you know i think is appropriate
um

05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:38.788 --> 05:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
i understand you know the passage of
 
05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
that law a lot of times there's a lot of
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
nuance in other things
 
05:53:46.470 --> 05:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
regarding sentences and someone spoke to
 
05:53:48.470 --> 05:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
it earlier um
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know the truth and sentencing here
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's just little things
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
like that that you know as
 
05:53:57.830 --> 05:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
the victim of attempted murder if i knew
 
05:54:00.070 --> 05:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
today what i then what i knew today in
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
terms of of this law and his ability to
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
reduce his time i obviously wouldn't
 
05:54:05.670 --> 05:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
have agreed to the sentence that was
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
basically the sticking point for me
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
agreeing to the 20 to 80. and so um

that's key

that's in the mission

section uh

651 a 2 2 a f of the current law allows

in this sense
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
these experiences are akin to
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
individualized education plans which are
 
05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
used in new hampshire public schools
 
05:58:54.070 --> 05:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
these are plans focused on the

individual based upon their needs
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
determined by assessments
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
this section helps accomplish a
 
05:59:06.070 --> 05:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
doc core mission
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
namely to provide evidence-based
 
05:59:11.830 --> 05:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation to enhance public safety
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
to enhance public safety
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
and reduce recidivation
 
05:59:20.830 --> 05:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
and engage in
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
progressive rehabilitation i've noted
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
the mission and core values as an
 
05:59:28.708 --> 05:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
appendix to this document i think it's
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
extremely important that this committee
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
who knows all about that probably should
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
re-read it again when you take a look at
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
research has documented that a key to
 
05:59:41.040 --> 05:59:42.190 align:start position:0%
research has documented that a key to
reducing

05:59:42.190 --> 05:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
reincarnations is improving the physical
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
and mental health of inmates providing
 
05:59:50.788 --> 05:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
educational and vocational programs that
 
05:59:53.670 --> 05:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
will prepare them for a congenial life
 
05:59:56.470 --> 05:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
in the family gainful employment and
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
participation as informed citizens in
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
civil society that's what we need
 
06:00:05.910 --> 06:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
these evidence-based programs do not
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
coddle inmates
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
they are not like a free lunch
 
06:00:14.868 --> 06:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
they are not a form of recreation
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
they require work in the classroom
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
and they require homework
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
completed in an inmate's cell
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is not being soft on crime or
 
06:00:28.000 --> 06:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
this is not being soft on crime or
punishment

06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
they demand
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
the department demands tenacity for
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
learning while inculcating
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
a love of lifelong learning because if
 
06:00:43.270 --> 06:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
if this doesn't stimulate
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
growth in the future for these inmates
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
who are released
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
then they may return
 
06:00:51.190 --> 06:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
so they
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
the department's well aware of that
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's why it's evidence-based these
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
programs are focused on recovery and
 
06:00:57.520 --> 06:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
programs are focused on recovery and
rehabilitation

it's amazing
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i would ask you to take a look at
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
the link that i provided to gives the
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
research behind those statements now
 
06:02:20.948 --> 06:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
those are national statements take a
 
06:02:23.430 --> 06:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening and i'm sure
 
06:02:23.440 --> 06:02:24.548 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening and i'm sure
that

06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
helen hanks will provide you with this
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
information see what happens to the
 
06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%

few years
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
it's declined
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
declined but you'll see that
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
now i also want to point out to you the
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
bad college prison initiative
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
and the support program
 
06:02:49.990 --> 06:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
for after release from prison is
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
extremely successful
 
06:02:54.868 --> 06:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
the rate of return is less than five
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
percent it's below the national average
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
bard has partnered with many colleges
 
06:03:03.190 --> 06:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
and universities including the
 
06:03:05.430 --> 06:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
university of vermont
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
and yale
 
06:03:11.110 --> 06:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
as well as many many other universities
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
and colleges throughout the

country

06:03:14.708 --> 06:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
i've also provided you a link with the
 
06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
bad college prison initiatives annual
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
report this is very important because
 
06:03:24.548 --> 06:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's just chock full of information that
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
this committee needs to use
 
06:03:29.190 --> 06:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
and it's simple it's down-to-earth
 
06:03:29.200 --> 06:03:31.350 align:start position:0%
and it's simple it's down-to-earth
straightforward

06:03:31.350 --> 06:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
you need to use in terms of
 
06:03:33.120 --> 06:03:34.548 align:start position:0%
you need to use in terms of
understanding

06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
importance or the importance of
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring less crime after
 
06:03:45.750 --> 06:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
being discharged from prison
 
06:03:48.390 --> 06:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
this earned time opportunity is based on
 
06:03:48.400 --> 06:03:50.230 align:start position:0%
this earned time opportunity is based on
incentives

06:03:50.230 --> 06:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
research has shown that behavioral
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
modification does facilitate change in
 
06:03:55.840 --> 06:03:57.110 align:start position:0%
modification does facilitate change in
behavior

06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
these incentives are used to encourage
 
06:04:02.628 --> 06:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
inmates to improve their lot
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
many of them have a fatalistic view of
 
06:04:05.280 --> 06:04:06.548 align:start position:0%
many of them have a fatalistic view of
life

06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
life
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
they lack a positive outlook about
 
06:04:08.638 --> 06:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
they lack a positive outlook about
themselves

06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
many have a defeatist attitude they've
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
hit the gutter and can't climb out
 
06:04:20.150 --> 06:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sympathetic to criminals i'm
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
hard on punishment
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm hard on rehabilitation
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's important
 
06:04:30.390 --> 06:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
in order to preserve society
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
the obstacles to them seem too high i've
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
got fallen so low why try
 
06:04:37.750 --> 06:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to end up in the same gutter
 
06:04:40.470 --> 06:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
all over again
 
06:04:43.030 --> 06:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're discouraged by peer pressure in
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the prison by other prisoners it's
 
06:04:50.310 --> 06:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to take that home
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
homework into your cell and work
 
06:04:55.590 --> 06:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
because some prisoners
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't like it
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that can be tough on those who want
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
to change
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
earned time credit is an inducement for
 
06:05:06.548 --> 06:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
them to learn it is a form of behavioral
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh modification
 
06:05:12.470 --> 06:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
reduce reducing recidivism
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
prevents more crime and accompanying
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
costs of reincarnation
 
06:05:17.200 --> 06:05:19.110 align:start position:0%
costs of reincarnation
reincarnation

06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%

return to prison
i

06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm amazed at myself i've deteriorated
 
06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
in my old 80 years it is a self-interest
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
of our state to reduce the numbers of
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
re-offenders thus reducing prison costs
 
06:05:43.190 --> 06:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
it will provide
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
safer communities and that's what
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
miss hanks is going to be talking about
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:53.670 --> 06:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is why the mission of the doc
 
06:05:56.230 --> 06:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
resonates with our membership
 
06:05:59.110 --> 06:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
our membership urges this committee to
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
determine that this amendment is
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
and as i said before
 
06:06:09.030 --> 06:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
you'll find the department mission and
 
06:06:11.590 --> 06:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
goals at the bottom of this
 
06:06:15.430 --> 06:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
because it's important that we focus on
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
what its intents are
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%

which
 
06:06:40.070 --> 06:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
do prisoner inmates ever take more than
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
enough courses to make uh
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
over 300 days off
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know that fact you could ask
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
helen about the statistics i don't want
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
to put words in their mouth okay thank

know what the current status is we've
 
06:07:15.990 --> 06:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
debated that question over and over

06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
had started a working with some area
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
colleges which our organization wants to
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
participate in and we're very
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
encouraging by the baad program
 
06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so the costs were discussed but i
 
06:07:41.430 --> 06:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't know the current situation thank
 
06:07:41.440 --> 06:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
don't know the current situation thank
you

06:07:46.070 --> 06:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:47.910 --> 06:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize myself for a
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
question um
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
we we've talked about
 
06:07:54.788 --> 06:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
the rehabilitation and the necessity to
 
06:07:56.948 --> 06:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate and and i agree with all
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
those things but we also heard from
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
victims and there's a there's definitely
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
a balancing act
 
06:08:04.470 --> 06:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has to look at
 
06:08:04.480 --> 06:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has to look at
and

06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
so we heard from a police officer who
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
was basically shot in the face and he's
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
got ptsd for the rest of his life i'm
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
quite sure and someone who was sentenced
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
to 20 to 80 years in prison
 
06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
do you not see anywhere in there where
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
there are certain levels or certain
 
06:08:24.548 --> 06:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
crimes so heinous that the there should
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
be a limitation on what they can whittle
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
away at the time they have to serve
 
06:08:30.788 --> 06:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
is there no punitive aspect at all in
 
06:08:33.990 --> 06:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
your mind for for incarceration yes i
 
06:08:36.548 --> 06:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
just i think i said that i'm hard on
 
06:08:36.558 --> 06:08:37.590 align:start position:0%
just i think i said that i'm hard on
crime

06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
crime
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
i am hard on crime
 
06:08:43.990 --> 06:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'm not a about crime
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
trust me trust the students i taught
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
we will pardon you
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear you maybe i
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
06:08:53.760 --> 06:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
uh

06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
crime and punishment is a balancing act
 
06:09:02.948 --> 06:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
the the mission of the department is to
 
06:09:02.958 --> 06:09:05.510 align:start position:0%
the the mission of the department is to
punish

06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.510 --> 06:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state wants to prevent future crimes
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
the judicial system is the one that
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
makes the decision of how long
 
06:09:18.788 --> 06:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
and they can put conditions
 
06:09:20.788 --> 06:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
on that sentence
 
06:09:20.798 --> 06:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
on that sentence
okay

06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
no matter what the highness crime may be
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
that person
 
06:09:33.840 --> 06:09:36.230 align:start position:0%
that person
might

06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.240 --> 06:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
change

06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the goal
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
if the person is not changing
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
trust me the penal system will keep them
 
06:09:46.788 --> 06:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
in place
 
06:09:48.628 --> 06:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
and the parole
 
06:09:51.190 --> 06:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
board will
 
06:09:54.070 --> 06:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
this is based on evidence-based
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
information and research this is tough
 
06:09:59.910 --> 06:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you i would say to the
 
06:09:59.920 --> 06:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you i would say to the
victim

06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
victim
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
victims groups
 
06:10:05.110 --> 06:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
we all should be advocating for
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
education of those who are victimized
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
because there's a concurrent need
 
06:10:14.390 --> 06:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
for the people who have been
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
a victim
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
06:10:23.510 --> 06:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
their sentence with this memory
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
is devastating i don't care if it's
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
someone taking money on the bank as they
 
06:10:31.590 --> 06:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
did with me from russia
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
or it's a person of a sexual assault you
 
06:10:36.160 --> 06:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
or it's a person of a sexual assault you
still

06:10:37.350 --> 06:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
still
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
have grief
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh and that has to be dealt with
 
06:10:44.548 --> 06:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
i think the state has a responsibility
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
and i certainly would consider uh
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that deals with that
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:24.708 --> 06:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
um that's a tough act to follow but
 
06:11:26.150 --> 06:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
well i won't
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
helen hanks commissioner of the
 
06:11:30.788 --> 06:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for the record
 
06:11:30.798 --> 06:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for the record
and

06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:33.430 --> 06:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
not intended to confuse the committee
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
you did hear from our administrative
 
06:11:36.548 --> 06:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
victim services because the mission of
 
06:11:38.548 --> 06:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
corrections includes supporting victims
 
06:11:40.150 --> 06:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
rights as well
 
06:11:42.628 --> 06:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
but on behalf of the agency we are not
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of the amendment in hb
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
1105 and i've given you a twofold an
 
06:11:48.868 --> 06:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide you a
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive packet of information
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
both to demonstrate the effects of
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
earntime credit since its inception and
 
06:11:58.868 --> 06:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
obviously moving forward
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'll start off by just clarifying some
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
what i call misinformation not
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
misintended but misinformation no one is
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
awarded earn time credit for completing
 
06:12:09.270 --> 06:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
the same program over and over and over
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
again it is a one-time consideration for
 
06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
the completion of that one program
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's deemed eligible and we have an
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
internal policy that i also attached uh
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
to the testimony that is specific to
 
06:12:22.070 --> 06:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
what's allowable
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh so i wanted to be clear there
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
and to represent pandalaka's question on
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
pays for courses
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
as we went through the budget process i
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the legislature for restoring
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
most of our educational funding but i
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
was also provided a mission and a charge
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
which is to find a tele path to
 
06:12:41.190 --> 06:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
education as well and we've continued to
 
06:12:43.750 --> 06:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
do that so in many instances as we even
 
06:12:45.830 --> 06:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
testified in 2014
 
06:12:47.830 --> 06:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who are working to attain an
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
associate's degree or higher are paying
 
06:12:51.990 --> 06:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
for that out of their own pocket
 
06:12:54.470 --> 06:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
the department provides opportunity for
 
06:12:56.628 --> 06:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
a high school diploma and individuals
 
06:12:58.070 --> 06:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
who are working toward their high school
 
06:13:00.470 --> 06:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
equivalency certificate have to pay 60
 
06:13:03.670 --> 06:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
dollars for that certificate program
 
06:13:05.190 --> 06:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
i've taken that charge from the budget
 
06:13:06.868 --> 06:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
process seriously and we're moving
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
forward with some partners in the pell
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
grant area now that the federal
 
06:13:11.750 --> 06:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
government's provided that opportunity
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
as well as a recent approval of arp
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to create the i.t infrastructure
 
06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
for would make those things possible
 
06:13:20.470 --> 06:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to the numbers of people uh to represent
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
a boarding's question that have hit 21
 
06:13:24.390 --> 06:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
months you can only hit 21 months you
 
06:13:26.230 --> 06:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
may not achieve more than that that's a
 
06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
rare instance
 
06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
since our time credits inception and one
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing people haven't talked about is i
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually deny
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
people earn time credit
 
06:13:37.190 --> 06:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner because their time
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
credit they're applying for is not
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
indicative of their prisoners
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and i think one mindful
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
very mindful
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
element of the statute is it's not
 
06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
prisoners it's it's individualized there
 
06:13:52.070 --> 06:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
is an apostrophe s rehabilitation i have
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
individuals whose primary need is sexual
 
06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
offender treatment who have remitted
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
applications for other earn time credit
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
and i have declined them because they
 
06:14:00.868 --> 06:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
are not willing to engage in sexual
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
offender treatment and their primary
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
criminogenic behavior was sexually
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
deviant behavior
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make those points readily
 
06:14:09.120 --> 06:14:10.390 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make those points readily
clear

06:14:10.390 --> 06:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
clear
 
06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about what has happened
 
06:14:14.628 --> 06:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
since earntime credit and some of the
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
things as this agency has done as many
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
of you have done is surmounted a
 
06:14:20.948 --> 06:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic in a corrections environment in
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
a way that if you had asked me in 2017
 
06:14:24.868 --> 06:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
to become the commissioner and become
 
06:14:25.910 --> 06:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of corrections through
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
a pandemic i would have politely
 
06:14:27.360 --> 06:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
a pandemic i would have politely
declined

06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
but with that said balancing
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
coveted quarantine medical isolation
 
06:14:38.548 --> 06:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
having our 1900 plus individuals who are
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated today have to be
 
06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
quarantined in some cases up to 28 days
 
06:14:45.750 --> 06:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
we did leverage our tablet technology
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
and through that tablet technology is a
 
06:14:50.230 --> 06:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
learning management system so we both
 
06:14:51.910 --> 06:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
facilitated coursework through our
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
granite state high school as well as
 
06:14:54.718 --> 06:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
granite state high school as well as
one

06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:14:58.150 --> 06:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
two two programs under other a
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
combination what's called the peace
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
education program and 10 correctional
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation institute programs
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
as well as a breaking free from
 
06:15:10.310 --> 06:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder i've included
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
all of that information in this packet
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
and the origin of the foundation for
 
06:15:16.230 --> 06:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
those decisions
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
one nuance that has only come to my
 
06:15:20.310 --> 06:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
attention since uh donna scitec brought
 
06:15:21.670 --> 06:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
it to my attention so i appreciate it
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
for that is there's a report that comes
 
06:15:25.270 --> 06:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
out from those other programs that has a
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
time to completion
 
06:15:28.708 --> 06:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
and it was articulating that in some
 
06:15:30.470 --> 06:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
instances they were completing things in
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
eight minutes well that seems not
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
equitable nor accurate so i'm working
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the vendor
 
06:15:39.510 --> 06:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
to say is that numeric correct and they
 
06:15:41.510 --> 06:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
said actually it's not it's not counting
 
06:15:43.350 --> 06:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
everything that they're doing so i just
 
06:15:44.788 --> 06:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
want to share that as a piece of
 
06:15:44.798 --> 06:15:46.470 align:start position:0%
want to share that as a piece of
information

06:15:46.470 --> 06:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
so if i go backward the department of
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
corrections and quite frankly the state
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire should be quite proud
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
for the last several years u.s news has
 
06:15:54.718 --> 06:15:55.510 align:start position:0%
for the last several years u.s news has
has

06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:15:57.670 --> 06:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
seen us in a positive light twofold for
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
a reduction in crime in our state and
 
06:16:01.270 --> 06:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the positive way in which we manage
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
corrections and that's the balance
 
06:16:02.878 --> 06:16:04.548 align:start position:0%
corrections and that's the balance
between

06:16:04.548 --> 06:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
the penalty associated with the criminal
 
06:16:08.230 --> 06:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
act and the rehabilitation and
 
06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
sentencing efforts we've moved forward
 
06:16:09.760 --> 06:16:10.868 align:start position:0%
sentencing efforts we've moved forward
on

06:16:10.868 --> 06:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
we should be honored and proud of that
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
because that is the mission that my
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
national corrections commissioner
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
partners engage in every day and so
 
06:16:20.390 --> 06:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
taking the person who's incarcerated
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
because most of them are returning to a
 
06:16:24.390 --> 06:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
community near us and finding a
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative path is our mission our
 
06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
primary mission each and every day and
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
earn time credit has created an
 
06:16:29.920 --> 06:16:31.270 align:start position:0%
earn time credit has created an
opportunity

06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
for people to be incentivized to engage
 
06:16:35.910 --> 06:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
but it also has created several layers
 
06:16:37.350 --> 06:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for that earned time
 
06:16:39.990 --> 06:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
credit to be forfeited so i also forfeit
 
06:16:41.750 --> 06:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
earn time credit post award if they
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
engage in a major a disciplinary action
 
06:16:46.470 --> 06:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
during incarceration or if they join a
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
security threat group i forfeit their
 
06:16:50.470 --> 06:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
earn time credit because it is a
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
privilege on top of an incentive
 
06:16:55.750 --> 06:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
those instances do happen
 
06:16:58.470 --> 06:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
when i during the height of the pandemic
 
06:16:59.830 --> 06:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
needed to create appropriate
 
06:17:02.470 --> 06:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative opportunities we measured
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
deploying and using that tablet learning
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
management system and did a study 20
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me 12 months prior to that
 
06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
implementation and looked at our major a
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
offenses and then looked at them after
 
06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
12 months and there was approximately a
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
21 decline in adverse a offense behavior
 
06:17:21.670 --> 06:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
and balanced with we still had the same
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
number of quarantine and medical
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
isolations because one would say they
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
weren't going anywhere what could they
 
06:17:27.350 --> 06:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
do well
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
that was all balanced so that did make a
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
difference as far as change in
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
institutional conduct and rehabilitative
 
06:17:36.628 --> 06:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
value the other part in my testimony and
 
06:17:38.470 --> 06:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the size even i'm
 
06:17:40.230 --> 06:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
struggling to read it
 
06:17:42.310 --> 06:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
is what is happening in our department
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
of corrections is because of these
 
06:17:45.910 --> 06:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
development of other programs is things
 
06:17:47.510 --> 06:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
that don't fit into the other sections
 
06:17:50.150 --> 06:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the statute so we've deployed those
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative programs and the re
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate one year post release is
 
06:17:58.230 --> 06:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
going down it's going down significantly
 
06:18:00.788 --> 06:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
each year that's a great sign and then
 
06:18:03.990 --> 06:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
the following year so starting in 2018
 
06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2020 people are not in new
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire returning to incarceration and
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
we continue to measure that that's
 
06:18:10.798 --> 06:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
we continue to measure that that's
rehabilitation

06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.470 --> 06:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
i want to drill in other programs as
 
06:18:18.548 --> 06:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
deemed by the commissioner yes by deemed
 
06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner but vetted by
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
national science if you will moral
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
recognition therapy is a copy written
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
program we deploy that you can earn
 
06:18:29.670 --> 06:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
earned credit for that
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
with breaking free from substance use
 
06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
was actually designed in the uk
 
06:18:34.868 --> 06:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
specifically to work in corrections
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
environments we deploy that i actually
 
06:18:39.750 --> 06:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes deny people sometimes approve
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
it it depends on if
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
they're actually meeting the level of
 
06:18:43.990 --> 06:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
participation associated with their
 
06:18:45.830 --> 06:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
latex assessment
 
06:18:47.190 --> 06:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
thinking for a change i think this
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee has heard of that program it
 
06:18:51.590 --> 06:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a nationally recognized uh
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
intervention for rehabilitation to
 
06:18:56.868 --> 06:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
change your criminogenic thinking
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
the other part on earned time credit is
 
06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
the actual and i provided you a copy of
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
the state sentencing document and i 100
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
empathize with individuals who went
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
through the justice system before the
 
06:19:10.628 --> 06:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
deployment of this law
 
06:19:12.230 --> 06:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
because it i do struggle when i have
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
those applications and it's not on their
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
sentencing minimus how that affects
 
06:19:18.948 --> 06:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
the history of of the decisions made at
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
sentencing but i also trust the
 
06:19:22.708 --> 06:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
judiciary process and that vetting
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
process and that happens in other
 
06:19:26.468 --> 06:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
instances of state statutes such as
 
06:19:28.708 --> 06:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
someone seeking a two-thirds reduction
 
06:19:30.628 --> 06:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
and other elements of state law that
 
06:19:33.030 --> 06:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
allow someone to even their own
 
06:19:35.190 --> 06:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
independent motion to suspend portions
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
of their sentences all trigger those
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
communication events and touches with
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
the judiciary system
 
06:19:41.750 --> 06:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i've highlighted that in the
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that on the minimus the
 
06:19:46.150 --> 06:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
education at sentencing if that box is
 
06:19:47.670 --> 06:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
checked should be to the people who are
 
06:19:49.590 --> 06:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
participating that you can you can
 
06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
experience up to
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
21 months of earn time credit
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
notification that those might happen if
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
that box is checked and what would
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
happen if that box is not checked that
 
06:20:00.548 --> 06:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
they would then try to solicit that
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
through the judiciary process post
 
06:20:02.320 --> 06:20:04.310 align:start position:0%
through the judiciary process post
incarceration

06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
06:20:06.628 --> 06:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
so i included a copy of that
 
06:20:07.990 --> 06:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing i put in here is there
 
06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
are three basic principles associated
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
with determining if a program has
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated value in a corrections
 
06:20:14.948 --> 06:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
environment and that the treatment is
 
06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
provided to people who assess for the
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
risk for it so you need you need it to
 
06:20:21.350 --> 06:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
change we assess that in our
 
06:20:22.948 --> 06:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
organization both through our risk
 
06:20:24.788 --> 06:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
assessments with our case managers our
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
clinicians and so on and so forth
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
through the incarcerated process
 
06:20:29.990 --> 06:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that the treatment program actually
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
targets those criminogenic behaviors
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
that have resulted in the
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
incarceration so it's anti-social
 
06:20:38.150 --> 06:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
attitude substance use disorder
 
06:20:39.190 --> 06:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety self-esteem or feel goods but
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of all of those
 
06:20:45.590 --> 06:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
things and finally that it's delivered
 
06:20:47.190 --> 06:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
in a responsive way to the person's
 
06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
style of learning
 
06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
using cognitive behavioral approaches
 
06:20:53.590 --> 06:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
and changing attitudes and ultimately
 
06:20:55.350 --> 06:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
teaching concrete skills that that
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
change how they respond in the future
 
06:20:59.830 --> 06:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
i bring that up and i'm headed to a
 
06:21:01.350 --> 06:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
close to let you ask me questions
 
06:21:02.948 --> 06:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
because i think one thing we've not
 
06:21:05.190 --> 06:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
talked about is the average grade level
 
06:21:07.110 --> 06:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
of a person who's incarcerated is fifth
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
grade so if we wrote all of our programs
 
06:21:12.708 --> 06:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
at a associate's bachelor's degree level
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
we would not be rehabilitating people so
 
06:21:17.670 --> 06:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of the things you see in here seem
 
06:21:20.230 --> 06:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe middle schoolish it should because
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have to translate to the audience
 
06:21:23.750 --> 06:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
participating in them and i include
 
06:21:25.590 --> 06:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
those statistics for you
 
06:21:27.430 --> 06:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
so as we charge for to improve the
 
06:21:29.190 --> 06:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
literacy of those incarcerated in new
 
06:21:30.628 --> 06:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire we also have to provide a
 
06:21:32.788 --> 06:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
balance of how we deploy information so
 
06:21:34.628 --> 06:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's actually absorbed understood
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:39.990 --> 06:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
i assure you and i appreciate the
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments made about the prudency in
 
06:21:43.030 --> 06:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
which i
 
06:21:44.788 --> 06:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
move forward on this and i do
 
06:21:47.670 --> 06:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
that we look at rehabilitative programs
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
we do take feedback we obviously make
 
06:21:52.150 --> 06:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
adjustments i've also included our
 
06:21:52.160 --> 06:21:53.910 align:start position:0%
adjustments i've also included our
application

06:21:53.910 --> 06:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's just the cover sheet that
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
does never never arrives to my office
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
alone it comes with numerous documents
 
06:22:00.878 --> 06:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
alone it comes with numerous documents
attached

06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
attached
 
06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:11.670 --> 06:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
06:22:12.868 --> 06:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
06:22:14.958 --> 06:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
um

06:22:15.990 --> 06:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
as i keep warning people i was i was
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
looking at other programs i don't know
 
06:22:25.990 --> 06:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the rsa i'm sure
 
06:22:28.628 --> 06:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
you are yes i am okay looking at other
 
06:22:28.638 --> 06:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
you are yes i am okay looking at other
programs

06:22:32.070 --> 06:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many there are i'm
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to say there are 10 10 other
 
06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
programs that you have come up with
 
06:22:42.070 --> 06:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
the way the amen the way the bill reads
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
do you read that that
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
even though there are 10 programs
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
four might be appropriate
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
but only one of them is going to get me
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
60 days that's how i interpret the
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative um bordenay
 
06:23:07.590 --> 06:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
06:23:07.600 --> 06:23:09.190 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

06:23:09.190 --> 06:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
how much time do you spend a week
 
06:23:13.990 --> 06:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating uh
 
06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
earned time off
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative boarding a i i spend a
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
surprisingly a lot of time a week
 
06:23:22.548 --> 06:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
i in fact have i think 20 applications
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
on my desk for this week
 
06:23:25.440 --> 06:23:26.150 align:start position:0%
on my desk for this week
so

06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
over fifty percent i will spend at least
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
one days worth of yeah well i really i
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
don't really work eight hours you get a
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
lot of good time out of me so let's just
 
06:23:37.350 --> 06:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
say roughly eight hours at a minimum of
 
06:23:39.190 --> 06:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing those applications
 
06:23:41.670 --> 06:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:23:44.788 --> 06:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.468 --> 06:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm assuming you're
 
06:23:52.708 --> 06:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
in favor of us passing this bill i would
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
recommend you itl this bill and leave
 
06:23:56.948 --> 06:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
the law as currently stated
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification you're
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
very welcome
 
06:24:07.590 --> 06:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:08.868 --> 06:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
my question i'm over here
 
06:24:10.958 --> 06:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
my question i'm over here
um

06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:13.670 --> 06:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have testimony
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
that listed a whole bunch of programs
 
06:24:16.788 --> 06:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
that look like they were all started on
 
06:24:19.110 --> 06:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
the same day and ended up maybe
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
three days later and
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't is there anything like that
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the uh or if there is is there
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that if there is how does
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
it does it affect you do you know
 
06:24:30.868 --> 06:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
anything about that it looks like maybe
 
06:24:32.310 --> 06:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're online programs or something
 
06:24:35.590 --> 06:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
like that i've not seen that i can only
 
06:24:37.110 --> 06:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
assume that has to do with what we
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
deployed in december of 2020
 
06:24:41.830 --> 06:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
obviously mid pandemic trying to
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
continue to deploy rehabilitated
 
06:24:45.190 --> 06:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
programs we used our tablet learning
 
06:24:46.628 --> 06:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
management system
 
06:24:48.948 --> 06:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
and again donna brought something to my
 
06:24:48.958 --> 06:24:50.150 align:start position:0%
and again donna brought something to my
attention

06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
attention
 
06:24:53.110 --> 06:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know in the summer of
 
06:24:56.070 --> 06:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
2021 that caused me to look more deeply
 
06:24:58.070 --> 06:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
at those programs
 
06:24:59.910 --> 06:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you but i've not been provided
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:12.558 --> 06:25:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes

thank you
 
06:25:18.788 --> 06:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
you have you have a big job
 
06:25:20.868 --> 06:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
um i was
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
in tr
 
06:25:24.390 --> 06:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
i was fascinated in listening intently
 
06:25:26.788 --> 06:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
to your testimony and also the previous
 
06:25:26.798 --> 06:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
to your testimony and also the previous
testimony

06:25:28.310 --> 06:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:25:30.548 --> 06:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
by mr adams
 
06:25:30.558 --> 06:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
by mr adams
um

06:25:32.390 --> 06:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:34.468 --> 06:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to begin my question with
 
06:25:34.478 --> 06:25:35.670 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to begin my question with
a

06:25:35.670 --> 06:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
comment that i heard years ago from some
 
06:25:41.670 --> 06:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
of my elementary school teacher friends
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
that if you want to know
 
06:25:45.510 --> 06:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
who's going to wind up in prison ask an
 
06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher and you'll get an
 
06:25:50.788 --> 06:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
idea of what's coming
 
06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
in all of the programs that you have
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've heard you say that you can
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
determine a level of participation
 
06:26:01.750 --> 06:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i want to i don't want to assume
 
06:26:04.868 --> 06:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
anything but i'd like to ask is a
 
06:26:08.230 --> 06:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
is a level of attitude adjustment
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
on an incarcerated person's
 
06:26:15.030 --> 06:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
and is that evaluated by you also
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
so representative newman that's an
 
06:26:18.788 --> 06:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
interesting question to try to ascertain
 
06:26:21.270 --> 06:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
a level of attitude adjustment what i
 
06:26:23.270 --> 06:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
will tell you is we absolutely look at
 
06:26:25.590 --> 06:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
their conduct and you have to look at
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
the conduct
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
at least six months prior to their
 
06:26:30.708 --> 06:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
submission of runtime credit and if
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
their conduct is not
 
06:26:33.120 --> 06:26:35.270 align:start position:0%
their conduct is not
exemplary

06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
exemplary
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
then i don't even consider the
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
application it doesn't even make it to
 
06:26:41.670 --> 06:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:44.150 --> 06:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:26:44.160 --> 06:26:47.910 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
representative

06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:26:49.920 --> 06:26:50.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

06:26:50.948 --> 06:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:52.310 --> 06:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've heard about
 
06:26:54.628 --> 06:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
is the the problem
 
06:26:56.230 --> 06:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
for some folks may be less with the
 
06:26:57.750 --> 06:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
courses themselves
 
06:26:59.030 --> 06:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
and more with the amount of
 
06:27:01.270 --> 06:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
notifications and how that process takes
 
06:27:01.280 --> 06:27:02.548 align:start position:0%
notifications and how that process takes
place

06:27:02.548 --> 06:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:27:02.558 --> 06:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
place
so

06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:05.430 --> 06:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
is there something
 
06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
that could be done to to change that
 
06:27:10.230 --> 06:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
process so for example i noticed that
 
06:27:11.590 --> 06:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
you have
 
06:27:13.430 --> 06:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the list of courses
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
there are some that have individual
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
names but there are others that appear
 
06:27:17.350 --> 06:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:27:19.110 --> 06:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
more of a curriculum
 
06:27:20.788 --> 06:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
where you have to actually complete
 
06:27:23.750 --> 06:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
multiple courses to get a credit
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
um is there a way to structure things so
 
06:27:27.910 --> 06:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
06:27:30.868 --> 06:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
less of an individualized course that
 
06:27:32.310 --> 06:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
can be completed
 
06:27:36.310 --> 06:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know maybe in a few hours and more
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
more of a structured curriculum so
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
basically you're getting maybe more bang
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the buck and there are fewer
 
06:27:46.150 --> 06:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
notifications to victims
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative muse i think that's an
 
06:27:49.590 --> 06:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
interesting question and it balanced
 
06:27:49.600 --> 06:27:50.390 align:start position:0%
interesting question and it balanced
with

06:27:50.390 --> 06:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:27:51.750 --> 06:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
if we're
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's always a
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach to each
 
06:27:55.200 --> 06:27:56.468 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach to each
person

06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:27:58.390 --> 06:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
i do think that we could try to be more
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
mindful about
 
06:28:02.548 --> 06:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
the process in which the application is
 
06:28:05.190 --> 06:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
processed so instead of it being here's
 
06:28:07.750 --> 06:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
one here's one here's one
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they only remit one application
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
for multiple things
 
06:28:15.350 --> 06:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
every quarter or every six months or
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
06:28:18.788 --> 06:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
but we could actually
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
likely change that in policy and not in
 
06:28:20.638 --> 06:28:22.948 align:start position:0%
likely change that in policy and not in
statute

06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:28:25.350 --> 06:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.270 --> 06:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's gonna all right
 
06:28:29.990 --> 06:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative jasmine
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
with the coursework you have
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it has to be completed
 
06:28:37.110 --> 06:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
by the prisoners
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
i have said heard it said that
 
06:28:44.230 --> 06:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
you can tell how many prisoners you're
 
06:28:45.910 --> 06:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to have by how many people can
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
read by the fourth grade
 
06:28:49.590 --> 06:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
do you come
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
do a lot of your prisoners come to you
 
06:28:55.030 --> 06:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
unable to read at a
 
06:28:56.788 --> 06:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
at the level they can complete these
 
06:28:59.590 --> 06:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
courses or are we making do we making
 
06:28:59.600 --> 06:29:00.628 align:start position:0%
courses or are we making do we making
some

06:29:00.628 --> 06:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:29:02.230 --> 06:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments for them
 
06:29:03.670 --> 06:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative testament that's a
 
06:29:05.430 --> 06:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
mindful question people are coming in
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
with a very low literacy level and we
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
have to tailor our curriculum if it's
 
06:29:13.110 --> 06:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
not already tailored to a fifth grade
 
06:29:15.430 --> 06:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
lead reading level and we actually have
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
a grant um that we've recently deployed
 
06:29:20.310 --> 06:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's working to do that through a
 
06:29:20.320 --> 06:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
that's working to do that through a
universal

06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
universal
 
06:29:23.110 --> 06:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
learning design theory
 
06:29:24.548 --> 06:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
so it's it's something we have to be
 
06:29:33.430 --> 06:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
06:29:37.670 --> 06:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you uh
 
06:29:37.680 --> 06:29:38.868 align:start position:0%

commissioner

06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
06:29:38.878 --> 06:29:40.628 align:start position:0%
commissioner
um

06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'll keep hearing stories about
 
06:29:48.150 --> 06:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
how traumatized victims are
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
by notifications from the prison
 
06:29:51.040 --> 06:29:51.990 align:start position:0%
by notifications from the prison
uh

06:29:51.990 --> 06:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
petitions to have be paroled for inmates
 
06:29:57.590 --> 06:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be paroled
 
06:29:59.590 --> 06:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what kind of pr i
 
06:30:01.510 --> 06:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
heard nicole
 
06:30:01.520 --> 06:30:03.350 align:start position:0%
heard nicole
but

06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:30:08.310 --> 06:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
can we do anything better to prepare our
 
06:30:12.468 --> 06:30:12.478 align:start position:0%
help victims uh get over their trauma
 
06:30:14.788 --> 06:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative ordinate i wouldn't
 
06:30:16.788 --> 06:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't attempt to try to answer
 
06:30:18.548 --> 06:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
that question on the fly here but i'll
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
certainly work with our victim services
 
06:30:22.548 --> 06:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
administrator to see what we can do to
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
improve or help
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
to represent muse's comment the process
 
06:30:27.840 --> 06:30:28.788 align:start position:0%
to represent muse's comment the process
um

06:30:28.788 --> 06:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:30.708 --> 06:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's the
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's the number of times and
 
06:30:35.910 --> 06:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i think every person affected by a
 
06:30:38.390 --> 06:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
criminal act really has their own path
 
06:30:40.628 --> 06:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
forward for themselves
 
06:30:44.070 --> 06:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:45.910 --> 06:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
06:30:48.150 --> 06:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's a quick one
 
06:30:50.070 --> 06:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
just a little one um
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
so you notify them every time that
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
they've earned time and they may reduce
 
06:30:54.868 --> 06:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
their sentence to let people know
 
06:30:56.230 --> 06:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be getting out early
 
06:30:57.430 --> 06:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
you let them know when they've been
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
penalized and it's gone the other
 
06:30:59.200 --> 06:31:00.150 align:start position:0%
penalized and it's gone the other
direction

06:31:00.150 --> 06:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
direction
 
06:31:01.990 --> 06:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
i've i've started to include our victim
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
services department on all those
 
06:31:06.468 --> 06:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
notifications okay yeah absolutely okay
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's the last question i'm gonna allow
 
06:31:09.990 --> 06:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
for this witness
 
06:31:11.830 --> 06:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
um but keep in mind members of the
 
06:31:13.910 --> 06:31:13.920 align:start position:0%

representing the aclu of new hampshire
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill
 
06:31:52.310 --> 06:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i am asking that this committee will
 
06:31:54.948 --> 06:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
itl this immediately and i will answer
 
06:31:56.390 --> 06:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have based on
 
06:31:59.270 --> 06:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony at the end
 
06:32:00.628 --> 06:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
the first thing that i just wanted to go
 
06:32:02.708 --> 06:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
into about this bill of why i'm opposing
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is it's based on a personal concern
 
06:32:07.910 --> 06:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
over whether or not there is a full
 
06:32:09.670 --> 06:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of the earned time credit
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
system and how it works
 
06:32:13.990 --> 06:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
also coupled with the fact that this is
 
06:32:15.750 --> 06:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
a department of corrections it's not a
 
06:32:17.670 --> 06:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
department of punishment which means
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the goal the number one objective
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the department of correction is to
 
06:32:22.868 --> 06:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate the people who go through
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
those doors
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
because we
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
as we know we're in we live in a state
 
06:32:27.040 --> 06:32:27.910 align:start position:0%
as we know we're in we live in a state
where

06:32:27.910 --> 06:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:32:29.110 --> 06:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
over 90 percent of the people
 
06:32:31.110 --> 06:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated are going to be returning
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
back to the community at some point in
 
06:32:35.510 --> 06:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
time so the goal should be to make sure
 
06:32:37.830 --> 06:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they are rehabilitated that you
 
06:32:37.840 --> 06:32:38.788 align:start position:0%
that they are rehabilitated that you
know

06:32:38.788 --> 06:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:32:40.468 --> 06:32:40.478 align:start position:0%
they do have an attitude adjustment as
 
06:32:42.070 --> 06:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
it was stated and that they're ready to
 
06:32:44.390 --> 06:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
come back to the community
 
06:32:47.190 --> 06:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to point out was on line
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh starting on line three um
 
06:32:53.030 --> 06:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
lines three and four it says the value
 
06:32:54.628 --> 06:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
of the value to the prisoners
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation which are not covered
 
06:32:56.558 --> 06:32:57.350 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation which are not covered
under

06:32:57.350 --> 06:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph a through and the reason i'm
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
sorry line three starting with the um
 
06:33:04.230 --> 06:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner deems to be
 
06:33:06.468 --> 06:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
valuable to the prisoners rehabilitation
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
which are not covered
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
um the reason why that's there is
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is a person's personal journey as
 
06:33:15.030 --> 06:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
someone who's been sentenced to the
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and i went
 
06:33:18.628 --> 06:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
through that whole process and came back
 
06:33:20.468 --> 06:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
to the community rehabilitated i can i
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
can assure you that a person's journey
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
to rehabilitation is unique it's
 
06:33:28.070 --> 06:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
personal and sometimes people achieve
 
06:33:30.788 --> 06:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
that milestone of being rehabilitated
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
through non-traditional means
 
06:33:35.350 --> 06:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
and this this this goes to
 
06:33:36.788 --> 06:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative boarding's question
 
06:33:38.230 --> 06:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
earlier about the discretion of the
 
06:33:40.150 --> 06:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner um leaving that to the
 
06:33:42.230 --> 06:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for um
 
06:33:44.150 --> 06:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
to determine these programs and it is
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
actually necessary because um there is
 
06:33:48.628 --> 06:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
not just one
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
um cookie cutter
 
06:33:52.390 --> 06:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
mold for every individual who goes
 
06:33:54.230 --> 06:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
through the department of corrections to
 
06:33:56.788 --> 06:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
to achieve their rehabilitation and the
 
06:33:58.868 --> 06:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
individuals who know the best of whether
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
or not someone is rehabilitated is going
 
06:34:02.548 --> 06:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
to be those that work in the department
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
of corrections who are around
 
06:34:08.868 --> 06:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
the residents 24 7. so i i think that
 
06:34:11.830 --> 06:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
further restricting and limiting um the
 
06:34:14.310 --> 06:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
incentives for people to take control of
 
06:34:17.110 --> 06:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
their life and engage in programs or
 
06:34:18.708 --> 06:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
activities that are going to actually
 
06:34:20.708 --> 06:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
change them i think presents a a
 
06:34:20.718 --> 06:34:22.788 align:start position:0%
change them i think presents a a
dangerous

06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
06:34:24.230 --> 06:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
concern that i think that we need to
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
06:34:27.030 --> 06:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i do want to
 
06:34:27.040 --> 06:34:29.830 align:start position:0%
one of the things i do want to
acknowledge

06:34:29.830 --> 06:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:33.670 --> 06:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:35.750 --> 06:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
the victims advocate groups are correct
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
about the re-traumatization that can
 
06:34:41.270 --> 06:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
happen through notices i i do want to um
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
to to give them that uh that credence it
 
06:34:44.320 --> 06:34:45.190 align:start position:0%
to to give them that uh that credence it
is

06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:34:47.830 --> 06:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
something that i recognize and i respect
 
06:34:49.990 --> 06:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i wanted to to
 
06:34:52.230 --> 06:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
talk about on that vein is the fact that
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
when an individual is rehabilitated they
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
are no longer the individual who created
 
06:34:59.430 --> 06:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
or did the offense physically they may
 
06:35:01.510 --> 06:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
be but mentally they are not the same
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
person and that is the shift that we're
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking for we're looking for a mental
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
shift because that is what determines
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not a person is going to be
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated we heard that crime has
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
been decreasing in the state and crime
 
06:35:15.910 --> 06:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing in the state means that
 
06:35:17.430 --> 06:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
people who are going back to the
 
06:35:17.440 --> 06:35:18.390 align:start position:0%
people who are going back to the
community

06:35:18.390 --> 06:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:35:20.948 --> 06:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
are not re-victimizing people that you
 
06:35:22.230 --> 06:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
know earlier today we heard about
 
06:35:24.390 --> 06:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
re-victimization in the problem that
 
06:35:25.830 --> 06:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
presents to the state and so when we're
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
hearing that there are people that are
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the department of corrections
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
who are who are not re-victimizing
 
06:35:34.548 --> 06:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
people we need to embrace that approach
 
06:35:36.390 --> 06:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
and see what are they doing that we can
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
continue and replicate that process so
 
06:35:40.788 --> 06:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
that you know we keep those numbers
 
06:35:42.310 --> 06:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
going up
 
06:35:42.320 --> 06:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
going up
uh

06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:35:45.670 --> 06:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
the other issue that i think of why uh
 
06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is is dangerous to limit the
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the earned time credit opportunities
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
is the prison itself is actually limited
 
06:35:55.190 --> 06:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
to the environment that that it's that
 
06:35:59.350 --> 06:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's at to to offer earn time credit um
 
06:36:01.590 --> 06:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh opportunities so uh the prison
 
06:36:03.750 --> 06:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't have wi-fi in the
 
06:36:06.468 --> 06:36:06.478 align:start position:0%
prison right so if you if you had if
 
06:36:08.070 --> 06:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
there was a program you know every
 
06:36:09.430 --> 06:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
member of this committee could come up
 
06:36:11.670 --> 06:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
with a program that everyone agreed with
 
06:36:13.830 --> 06:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
let's just say all 24 members you know
 
06:36:16.628 --> 06:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
agreed on a program if that program can
 
06:36:18.548 --> 06:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
only be delivered on wi-fi and it's the
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
most rehabilitative program it it's not
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
currently going to be able to be
 
06:36:24.868 --> 06:36:24.878 align:start position:0%
rolled out in the prison they don't have
 
06:36:27.190 --> 06:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
that ability so they are limited to the
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
individuals that volunteer for the
 
06:36:31.350 --> 06:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are hired to do the
 
06:36:34.468 --> 06:36:34.478 align:start position:0%
programs um in what technological
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
advances or you know
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
capacities they have in order to roll
 
06:36:42.390 --> 06:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
out programs so the tablet system was
 
06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
was a step in that direction because
 
06:36:46.948 --> 06:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
every resident who is incarcerated has
 
06:36:49.510 --> 06:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
access to a tablet system and so what
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
that means is that every resident does
 
06:36:54.150 --> 06:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
have the ability to meaningfully engage
 
06:36:56.310 --> 06:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the programs that are offered on the
 
06:36:57.910 --> 06:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
tablet system
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i do agree that you know what
 
06:37:02.150 --> 06:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
whether if this is about having a
 
06:37:04.628 --> 06:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
structure in place for the programs that
 
06:37:06.310 --> 06:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
are that are there as opposed to
 
06:37:08.868 --> 06:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
limiting the time i think that then that
 
06:37:10.628 --> 06:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
should be explored but to actually just
 
06:37:13.110 --> 06:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
limit the time across the board that is
 
06:37:15.190 --> 06:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
very harmful and
 
06:37:17.430 --> 06:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i use myself as an example of this
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
language specifically when it talks
 
06:37:21.270 --> 06:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
about limiting a through e
 
06:37:21.280 --> 06:37:22.868 align:start position:0%
about limiting a through e
um

06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
i myself you know when i was sentenced
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the department of corrections i
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't have kids so i was not
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
able to do the family connection program
 
06:37:31.830 --> 06:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any mental health issues i
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to do any of the mental
 
06:37:35.750 --> 06:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
health programs for earn time credit i
 
06:37:37.910 --> 06:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
already had my high school diploma when
 
06:37:39.270 --> 06:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
i was sentenced to prison which means
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
that i wasn't able to engage in the ged
 
06:37:43.990 --> 06:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
or high set i had to buy my own time
 
06:37:45.910 --> 06:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
credit through
 
06:37:48.070 --> 06:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
through the college program and not
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
every residence has those economic means
 
06:37:52.628 --> 06:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
where they're able to purchase um the
 
06:37:54.150 --> 06:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
the college programs and they're you
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
know for someone that's incarcerated
 
06:37:57.990 --> 06:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that can be expensive so i i
 
06:37:59.110 --> 06:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:38:01.590 --> 06:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
so but this bill right here would have
 
06:38:03.030 --> 06:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
specifically applied to me where i
 
06:38:04.468 --> 06:38:04.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i would have been just barred
 
06:38:06.390 --> 06:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
across the board from the earned time
 
06:38:08.548 --> 06:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
that the prison um offered and i think
 
06:38:10.788 --> 06:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
that that uh that that is that's an
 
06:38:10.798 --> 06:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
that that uh that that is that's an
issue

06:38:11.910 --> 06:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:38:13.750 --> 06:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
one of the other things too is that at
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
the time of sentencing a judge
 
06:38:19.990 --> 06:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
and a county prosecutor are aware of the
 
06:38:22.628 --> 06:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
earned time credit provisions in this in
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
uh offered at the doc
 
06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is a determination that they make
 
06:38:28.150 --> 06:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
at the time of sentencing they the
 
06:38:30.468 --> 06:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
county attorney will usually meet with
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
the the defense lawyer and the judge and
 
06:38:36.230 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
they will say well this individual
 
06:38:38.070 --> 06:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
should be eligible for earn time credit
 
06:38:40.628 --> 06:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
or no this individual shouldn't and
 
06:38:43.430 --> 06:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
that right then and there is if they're
 
06:38:45.590 --> 06:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for earned time credit at the
 
06:38:48.548 --> 06:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
time of sentencing it would be safe to
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
assume hypothetically then that that
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
individual would be able to earn up to
 
06:38:54.628 --> 06:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
21 months off of their off of their time
 
06:38:56.468 --> 06:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
and and it's going to be through repeat
 
06:38:59.990 --> 06:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
or repeated process there is not one
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
avenue in the prison to earn 21 months
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
of earned time credit you have to do
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
multiple things
 
06:39:07.670 --> 06:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that when we take a look at
 
06:39:09.990 --> 06:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
society as a whole we do see many
 
06:39:13.590 --> 06:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
systems where this where you do have
 
06:39:15.190 --> 06:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
a reward system that's in conjunction
 
06:39:16.868 --> 06:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
with achievements where a person can
 
06:39:19.110 --> 06:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
keep doing achievements and continue to
 
06:39:22.468 --> 06:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
be rewarded for that i think that
 
06:39:23.990 --> 06:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying that an individual doing a
 
06:39:25.990 --> 06:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
program 10 times if they're doing 10
 
06:39:28.070 --> 06:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
separate programs you don't know what
 
06:39:29.910 --> 06:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
impact that will have on that individual
 
06:39:32.310 --> 06:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
it may be a program that shifts that
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
person's thinking that stops them from
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about things in a criminal
 
06:39:37.670 --> 06:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
manner and so i think that we should
 
06:39:39.510 --> 06:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
they should have that ability and that
 
06:39:41.350 --> 06:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
should be rewarded when they are taking
 
06:39:44.230 --> 06:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
that conscious step to change their
 
06:39:46.788 --> 06:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
actions and change their life and again
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
that is a determination
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
after the courts and the county attorney
 
06:39:51.910 --> 06:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
has agreed to that that's a
 
06:39:53.670 --> 06:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
determination that the department of
 
06:39:55.510 --> 06:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
corrections looks at and i know that
 
06:39:57.030 --> 06:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
they deny people because i'm the one
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that gets the calls is like hey can you
 
06:40:01.030 --> 06:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
sue the the doc they won't give me my
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
own time credit well why what happened
 
06:40:05.990 --> 06:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh i got a ticket well well i i can't do
 
06:40:07.750 --> 06:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
anything about that if you got a ticket
 
06:40:10.150 --> 06:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
and so it does happen it's not just this
 
06:40:10.160 --> 06:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
and so it does happen it's not just this
free

06:40:11.430 --> 06:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
free
 
06:40:13.590 --> 06:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
free reign for people um getting earned
 
06:40:15.030 --> 06:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
time credit there are people that get
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
that that do get it um
 
06:40:17.200 --> 06:40:18.708 align:start position:0%
that that do get it um
um

06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:18.718 --> 06:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
um
denied

06:40:19.750 --> 06:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
denied
 
06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
and um one of the last things that i i
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to um
 
06:40:27.510 --> 06:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to to talk on was about the hours
 
06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum
 
06:40:33.270 --> 06:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
it depends on what the specific program
 
06:40:35.910 --> 06:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
is there is an accounting program that
 
06:40:38.548 --> 06:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
has multiple things underneath it um
 
06:40:39.750 --> 06:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
that you know i think that
 
06:40:41.190 --> 06:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative news has talked about
 
06:40:43.030 --> 06:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
that you'll see those and you'll see
 
06:40:44.948 --> 06:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
multiple things and that's why you get
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
one certification but there are some
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
other programs that are very specific
 
06:40:51.750 --> 06:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
they are they are geared towards one
 
06:40:54.230 --> 06:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
aspect and that is why they're only
 
06:40:56.708 --> 06:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
under one one thing um
 
06:40:58.468 --> 06:40:58.478 align:start position:0%
so that is uh that you know that's what
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
i would have to say on that
 
06:41:01.440 --> 06:41:02.230 align:start position:0%
i would have to say on that
um

06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:03.750 --> 06:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
another thing that you know this is not
 
06:41:06.230 --> 06:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
related to uh it is related to the
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard today and as
 
06:41:11.270 --> 06:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
someone who was referred to by by the
 
06:41:12.708 --> 06:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
statements that were made i do feel that
 
06:41:15.430 --> 06:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
i have a duty to to say this because it
 
06:41:17.910 --> 06:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
was done in a public manner but we have
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:25.510 --> 06:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerning this bill that i that i
 
06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe uh we need to we need to be
 
06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
cautionary about considering where where
 
06:41:31.350 --> 06:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
it came from and given that the fact
 
06:41:34.948 --> 06:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
that there was a a public history of of
 
06:41:37.350 --> 06:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
bias and racism towards the individuals
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by this
 
06:41:40.948 --> 06:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
and with that i will
 
06:41:42.868 --> 06:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
end my testimony and i'm happy to answer
 
06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
06:41:44.320 --> 06:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
have

06:41:47.750 --> 06:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:51.030 --> 06:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
represented newman
 
06:41:54.948 --> 06:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
for these earn time uh credit programs
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
can people take like two of them at the
 
06:41:59.510 --> 06:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
same time can it be taken
 
06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
in that manner or did they do them one
 
06:42:02.830 --> 06:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
and then another one
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
sequentially so that's a that's a great
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
question you can take uh programs as
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
long as you are accepted into the
 
06:42:12.070 --> 06:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
program so if
 
06:42:13.510 --> 06:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you take the thinking for a
 
06:42:15.110 --> 06:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
change program for example if this
 
06:42:16.708 --> 06:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
program you know this program offers
 
06:42:17.990 --> 06:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
earn time credit if you're in thinking
 
06:42:19.990 --> 06:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
for a change while also currently
 
06:42:23.190 --> 06:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a mental health program it
 
06:42:25.350 --> 06:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
is possible yes that you could get earn
 
06:42:27.750 --> 06:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
time credit for um you would get earn
 
06:42:28.948 --> 06:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
time credit for both them and you could
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
be enrolled in both of them at the same
 
06:42:30.718 --> 06:42:31.510 align:start position:0%
be enrolled in both of them at the same
time

06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
you could be enrolled in educational
 
06:42:35.670 --> 06:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
classes while also enrolled in a mental
 
06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
health class too and be able to
 
06:42:40.788 --> 06:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
have earn time credit for both of them
 
06:42:42.708 --> 06:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
but one thing that individuals
 
06:42:44.948 --> 06:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
do and it's something that um you know i
 
06:42:47.830 --> 06:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
i uh advise people when they when they
 
06:42:50.708 --> 06:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
call and they ask um
 
06:42:53.030 --> 06:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know is is that usually individuals
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
will wait
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
to till they have amassed all of the
 
06:42:58.230 --> 06:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
earned time credit that they're either
 
06:43:00.230 --> 06:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
gonna go for or that they can get and
 
06:43:02.310 --> 06:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
then they put in for it at one time and
 
06:43:04.230 --> 06:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
the reason why is because the wording of
 
06:43:05.990 --> 06:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is that it has to occur on the
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
sentence that they are doing so there is
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
some some people don't un think that
 
06:43:12.708 --> 06:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
well if i have a consecutive sentence if
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
i parole the second sentence i'm not
 
06:43:15.830 --> 06:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to earn from my earn time so
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
they just want to do it on one time and
 
06:43:19.590 --> 06:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
and that may not be the case um
 
06:43:22.150 --> 06:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
statutorily but that is a philosophy
 
06:43:23.510 --> 06:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
that people have so
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
usually people will wait till they have
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
gotten all their earned time and then
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
they'll put in for all at once which
 
06:43:31.670 --> 06:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
will which will you know then go to the
 
06:43:34.948 --> 06:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner if um they have the box
 
06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
checked off on their minimus that allows
 
06:43:39.430 --> 06:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the doc to award them good time and
 
06:43:40.948 --> 06:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
earn time and if they don't then they
 
06:43:47.510 --> 06:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.350 --> 06:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
quick question sure did they have the
 
06:43:51.350 --> 06:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
tablet program while you were
 
06:43:51.360 --> 06:43:53.110 align:start position:0%
tablet program while you were
yes

06:43:53.110 --> 06:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
and there being no wi-fi how does it
 
06:43:57.510 --> 06:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
work did they upload the programs before
 
06:43:59.270 --> 06:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
they issued the tablets how does that
 
06:44:02.230 --> 06:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
work so it's an intranet system that um
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
that they came and installed the the
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
company came in they installed um
 
06:44:09.350 --> 06:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
routers directly onto the housing units
 
06:44:11.990 --> 06:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
itself and then these routers um they go
 
06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
to a uh they they go out to um
 
06:44:16.788 --> 06:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
the servers
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
the servers are hard lined to the
 
06:44:20.468 --> 06:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
internet and that is you know that's
 
06:44:22.868 --> 06:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
secure that's kept securely and so the
 
06:44:25.510 --> 06:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
tablets while the tablets themselves
 
06:44:28.070 --> 06:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
use a wi-fi system it's actually on the
 
06:44:29.990 --> 06:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
internet it's internet so anything
 
06:44:31.510 --> 06:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's on there's only you have access
 
06:44:31.520 --> 06:44:32.868 align:start position:0%
that's on there's only you have access
to

06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:44:34.548 --> 06:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:44:40.230 --> 06:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:59.110 --> 06:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:59.120 --> 06:45:06.468 align:start position:0%
 
hello

06:45:06.468 --> 06:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:06.478 --> 06:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
06:45:27.670 --> 06:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee i'm donna scitec i'm from
 
06:45:30.868 --> 06:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
salem and i just finished 10 years on
 
06:45:32.868 --> 06:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
the parole board
 
06:45:32.878 --> 06:45:34.468 align:start position:0%
the parole board
um

06:45:34.468 --> 06:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:35.830 --> 06:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
i asked
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
our representative abbas
 
06:45:40.708 --> 06:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
to introduce a bill to call attention
 
06:45:42.310 --> 06:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
to some concerns
 
06:45:44.390 --> 06:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
that i had about the earned time credit
 
06:45:44.400 --> 06:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
that i had about the earned time credit
program

06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature has approved the
 
06:45:52.468 --> 06:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
awarding of time for
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
earned time for against their minimum
 
06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
and maximum
 
06:45:57.990 --> 06:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
for certain programs and i've given you
 
06:46:00.468 --> 06:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
a copy of the statute and you can see
 
06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
the types of programs and how many days
 
06:46:05.350 --> 06:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
that they'd be eligible for if they
 
06:46:09.190 --> 06:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
completed them and i would remind you
 
06:46:10.948 --> 06:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
the earned time credit is applied not
 
06:46:15.350 --> 06:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
only to their minimum but also to their
 
06:46:15.360 --> 06:46:17.190 align:start position:0%
only to their minimum but also to their
maximum

06:46:17.190 --> 06:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
06:46:19.030 --> 06:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the sentence is getting smaller from
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
both ends
 
06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
and you heard the victim advocate talk
 
06:46:22.798 --> 06:46:25.510 align:start position:0%
and you heard the victim advocate talk
about

06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.070 --> 06:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
travel restrictions that would when we
 
06:46:29.910 --> 06:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
parole somebody sometimes will say you
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
can't go to nashua because the victim
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
lives there that only works during the
 
06:46:36.310 --> 06:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
period of their parole
 
06:46:38.788 --> 06:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
and if their parole is shortened
 
06:46:40.390 --> 06:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
through the application of runtime
 
06:46:45.270 --> 06:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
credits the victim is less protected but
 
06:46:48.070 --> 06:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
last year when i was still on the board
 
06:46:50.708 --> 06:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
i noticed that uh inmates that we
 
06:46:52.948 --> 06:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
typically would see two months before
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
their minimum
 
06:46:55.990 --> 06:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
were coming to a parole hearing with
 
06:46:58.468 --> 06:46:58.478 align:start position:0%
only weeks left to their minimum
 
06:46:59.830 --> 06:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
and this was because they've been
 
06:47:02.150 --> 06:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
awarded earn time credit under the new
 
06:47:02.160 --> 06:47:03.190 align:start position:0%
awarded earn time credit under the new
provision

06:47:03.190 --> 06:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:47:04.788 --> 06:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
06:47:06.788 --> 06:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
offered in paragraph f of the current
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
law and i've highlighted that
 
06:47:11.350 --> 06:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
this paragraph up the other programs
 
06:47:13.030 --> 06:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
was new
 
06:47:13.040 --> 06:47:13.910 align:start position:0%
was new
now

06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:47:16.708 --> 06:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not a stranger to the legislature
 
06:47:16.718 --> 06:47:17.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not a stranger to the legislature
uh

06:47:17.510 --> 06:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
i follow the legislation i said where
 
06:47:21.110 --> 06:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
did this come from
 
06:47:23.510 --> 06:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
and looking at my experience on the
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
parole board you know suddenly there's
 
06:47:28.070 --> 06:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
all this earned time credit indeed the
 
06:47:29.990 --> 06:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
number of inmates are receiving earn
 
06:47:33.910 --> 06:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
time credit in all of 2020 was 274.
 
06:47:37.190 --> 06:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
so 274 people got earned time credit in
 
06:47:38.830 --> 06:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
all 19 of
 
06:47:42.070 --> 06:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
2020. but in the first first nine months
 
06:47:43.830 --> 06:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
of 2021
 
06:47:48.468 --> 06:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:50.150 --> 06:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
a 460
 
06:47:50.160 --> 06:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
a 460
increase

06:47:51.510 --> 06:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:47:55.830 --> 06:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
so what the heck is going on
 
06:47:57.670 --> 06:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
because this was during the pandemic and
 
06:47:59.510 --> 06:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the traditional programs had
 
06:48:01.670 --> 06:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
been shut down so why where was all the
 
06:48:04.548 --> 06:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
certain time credit uh coming from
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
so i looked at it and it was being
 
06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
awarded for these other programs under
 
06:48:11.030 --> 06:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph f
 
06:48:13.990 --> 06:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
i said well where did that come from
 
06:48:15.750 --> 06:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i did a little digging
 
06:48:17.830 --> 06:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i found out that was added as an
 
06:48:22.390 --> 06:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to an omnibus senate edna bill
 
06:48:24.708 --> 06:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
that had 23 sections
 
06:48:27.910 --> 06:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
this committee never saw this provision
 
06:48:29.830 --> 06:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
it was thrown in and nobody paid
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
attention to it
 
06:48:31.760 --> 06:48:33.910 align:start position:0%
attention to it
so

06:48:33.910 --> 06:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:36.150 --> 06:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
before this
 
06:48:38.628 --> 06:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
before this other program's provision
 
06:48:41.510 --> 06:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
was added the legislature went through
 
06:48:44.310 --> 06:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
and evaluated each of the programs that
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for on-time credit and
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
over the years the list has grown
 
06:48:52.150 --> 06:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
and as has been said in the sentencing
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
document the judge specifies whether
 
06:48:57.590 --> 06:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
they'd be eligible for end time credit
 
06:48:57.600 --> 06:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
they'd be eligible for end time credit
so

06:49:03.670 --> 06:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:06.150 --> 06:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
this uh the the new provision he gave
 
06:49:07.910 --> 06:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
the commission of the authority to add
 
06:49:09.750 --> 06:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
programs that she deems valuable to an
 
06:49:11.590 --> 06:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
inmate's rehabilitation without coming
 
06:49:13.350 --> 06:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
back to you i mean that that's a
 
06:49:16.150 --> 06:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
inefficient way to do it
 
06:49:17.910 --> 06:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
but that's the reason i'm here for you
 
06:49:21.030 --> 06:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
today i'm worried about one particular
 
06:49:26.468 --> 06:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:28.070 --> 06:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about the programs that are
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
completed on the tablet
 
06:49:31.910 --> 06:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
and an inmate
 
06:49:34.468 --> 06:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
all the inmates have uh access to a
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
tablet and they can
 
06:49:39.110 --> 06:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
watch a video uh selected from a list of
 
06:49:41.590 --> 06:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
available programs and then they answer
 
06:49:43.350 --> 06:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions that are multiple choice true
 
06:49:45.030 --> 06:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
or false
 
06:49:46.468 --> 06:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
the prisoners have told us they can
 
06:49:48.150 --> 06:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
complete three or four programs in a
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
day's time
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
and all of this is done independently
 
06:49:53.510 --> 06:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's watching them we don't know
 
06:49:55.030 --> 06:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're cheating
 
06:49:56.788 --> 06:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
there's no monitoring there's no
 
06:49:59.350 --> 06:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
in-person group discussion like they
 
06:50:01.910 --> 06:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be for a mental health program
 
06:50:04.150 --> 06:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
or an educational program or a sex
 
06:50:06.230 --> 06:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
offender program where you have to go
 
06:50:11.030 --> 06:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:13.670 --> 06:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
work on your tablet so i was concerned
 
06:50:14.788 --> 06:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
about that
 
06:50:17.190 --> 06:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
and so this i've on the back of this
 
06:50:20.150 --> 06:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
sheet uh is a transcript of somebody who
 
06:50:22.390 --> 06:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
completed some programs
 
06:50:25.350 --> 06:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
and you can see from the dates
 
06:50:27.190 --> 06:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
that he would start it
 
06:50:30.070 --> 06:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
on you know march 11th and finish it on
 
06:50:32.548 --> 06:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
march 11th and get 100
 
06:50:34.390 --> 06:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
you go through all the programs that he
 
06:50:37.110 --> 06:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
did he can do it really quickly
 
06:50:39.910 --> 06:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i would question the value of
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
programs that can be
 
06:50:47.030 --> 06:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
awarded earn time credit without any
 
06:50:49.270 --> 06:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
anything other than watching a video and
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
answering true or false
 
06:50:53.430 --> 06:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
06:50:57.430 --> 06:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
i do a bible reading every day and
 
06:50:59.430 --> 06:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
i probably forgot what i read yesterday
 
06:51:00.390 --> 06:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:51:00.400 --> 06:51:02.150 align:start position:0%
you know
so

06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
something that you just read and don't
 
06:51:08.468 --> 06:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
have any conversation any
 
06:51:11.430 --> 06:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
any tests other than a multiple choice i
 
06:51:13.430 --> 06:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
i just wonder
 
06:51:13.440 --> 06:51:14.708 align:start position:0%
i just wonder
so

06:51:14.708 --> 06:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:16.788 --> 06:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
so all of this is to set up a policy
 
06:51:19.510 --> 06:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
question for you the policy makers do
 
06:51:21.270 --> 06:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
you think it's appropriate to award the
 
06:51:24.390 --> 06:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
same 60-day sentence reduction for
 
06:51:26.708 --> 06:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
spending a day or two watching videos
 
06:51:29.430 --> 06:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
the same amount as for like a six-month
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
mental health program
 
06:51:33.670 --> 06:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
our nine-month drug treatment program
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
our sex offender program
 
06:51:40.948 --> 06:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:40.958 --> 06:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:51:41.670 --> 06:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
programs on the tablet are eligible for
 
06:51:45.910 --> 06:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
06:51:47.430 --> 06:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:51:50.390 --> 06:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
equivalent to these in-person programs
 
06:51:53.830 --> 06:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
that require your participation and
 
06:51:53.840 --> 06:51:55.350 align:start position:0%
that require your participation and
engagement

06:51:55.350 --> 06:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
06:51:57.510 --> 06:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the policy question for you
 
06:51:59.110 --> 06:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
personally i don't think they ought to
 
06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
get 60 days for the tablet programs
 
06:52:05.190 --> 06:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of the programs under other
 
06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
are very valuable one of them is moral
 
06:52:07.440 --> 06:52:09.110 align:start position:0%
are very valuable one of them is moral
recognition

06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
not recognition moral recognation
 
06:52:11.360 --> 06:52:12.468 align:start position:0%
not recognition moral recognation
therapy

06:52:12.468 --> 06:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
06:52:16.150 --> 06:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that is a series of uh in-person
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
programs and the inmates rave about it
 
06:52:20.390 --> 06:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
how it has really changed them
 
06:52:22.628 --> 06:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
maybe the legislature wants to specify
 
06:52:24.468 --> 06:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
which of these other programs should be
 
06:52:26.548 --> 06:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
eligible for 60 days
 
06:52:28.708 --> 06:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you want to look at the tablet
 
06:52:30.628 --> 06:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
programs and say maybe they're not maybe
 
06:52:32.230 --> 06:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
they're worth something
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
that is 60 days maybe they're worth 30
 
06:52:36.708 --> 06:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
days maybe they're worth something other
 
06:52:38.070 --> 06:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
than that
 
06:52:40.310 --> 06:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm aware that the uh department of
 
06:52:41.990 --> 06:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
corrections is tightening up their
 
06:52:43.990 --> 06:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
process for documenting all the programs
 
06:52:46.310 --> 06:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for on-time credit and
 
06:52:49.030 --> 06:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing uh but i question
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
the question for you is whether an
 
06:52:52.150 --> 06:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon of watching videos should
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
merit the same 60-day sentence reduction
 
06:52:57.990 --> 06:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
as a months-long in-person counseling or
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
educational or vocational program
 
06:53:02.788 --> 06:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
06:53:02.798 --> 06:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
uh

06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:06.708 --> 06:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
from my experience uh the most i've ever
 
06:53:09.110 --> 06:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
seen an inmate awarded earn time credit
 
06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
we had
 
06:53:12.310 --> 06:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
a woman who was in who took advantage of
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
everything she got 620 days
 
06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's the most i've seen for any inmate
 
06:53:20.070 --> 06:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
now that's unusual
 
06:53:22.948 --> 06:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
the current members of the board told me
 
06:53:25.750 --> 06:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
about a
 
06:53:25.760 --> 06:53:26.708 align:start position:0%
about a
recent

06:53:26.708 --> 06:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
recent
 
06:53:28.070 --> 06:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
parole hearing
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
where the inmate had been
 
06:53:31.910 --> 06:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
he was going on social security
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
disability so they asked what's your
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
disability well i have a learning
 
06:53:34.558 --> 06:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
disability well i have a learning
disability

06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
disability
 
06:53:36.000 --> 06:53:37.590 align:start position:0%
disability
um

06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:40.230 --> 06:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
yet he was awarded earned time credit
 
06:53:41.830 --> 06:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
for multiple
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
tablet programs
 
06:53:44.160 --> 06:53:45.030 align:start position:0%
tablet programs
so

06:53:45.030 --> 06:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:46.548 --> 06:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
if you've got a learning disability how
 
06:53:48.070 --> 06:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to complete a program that
 
06:53:50.070 --> 06:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
you've got to watch a video and read the
 
06:53:52.548 --> 06:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
test so we wonder about that
 
06:53:54.150 --> 06:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
so i think this is something that is
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
ripe for legislative review
 
06:53:58.868 --> 06:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't want to pass the bill as
 
06:54:00.868 --> 06:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
introduced but i i would hope that you
 
06:54:02.390 --> 06:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
would consider
 
06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe listing the specific programs
 
06:54:06.948 --> 06:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
that you think are eligible for 30 days
 
06:54:09.190 --> 06:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
and decide whether you want to
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
give the same amount for tablet programs
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
if you think that everything's fine
 
06:54:15.750 --> 06:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't pass the bill but if you think it
 
06:54:18.070 --> 06:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
requires some attention
 
06:54:20.628 --> 06:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
work with the department and figure out
 
06:54:25.430 --> 06:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
what should be eligible for
 
06:54:28.868 --> 06:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
what amount over in time credit
 
06:54:32.628 --> 06:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:37.990 --> 06:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:39.430 --> 06:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:54:41.750 --> 06:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question i i owe an apology
 
06:54:41.760 --> 06:54:42.868 align:start position:0%
taking my question i i owe an apology
because

06:54:42.868 --> 06:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:54:44.468 --> 06:54:44.478 align:start position:0%
this paper had been on my desk and i
 
06:54:46.150 --> 06:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
didn't i i thought you had already
 
06:54:48.548 --> 06:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
testified and i asked the question i was
 
06:54:50.468 --> 06:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
referring to this paper
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
when i talked to commissioner hanks and
 
06:54:55.750 --> 06:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
asked about this particular question
 
06:54:58.868 --> 06:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:00.548 --> 06:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
i'm confused as to whether you're in
 
06:55:03.350 --> 06:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
favor of or against this bill and
 
06:55:04.868 --> 06:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
because on the one hand you said you
 
06:55:07.750 --> 06:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
think that the paragraph is helpful
 
06:55:09.510 --> 06:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand you said that this
 
06:55:11.430 --> 06:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
needs legislative review because this
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
this may not be appropriate to be
 
06:55:14.868 --> 06:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
counted as one of the things that's
 
06:55:16.390 --> 06:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
right i think
 
06:55:19.590 --> 06:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to amend the bill
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
to say to add the the programs that are
 
06:55:24.628 --> 06:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
currently offered under other and
 
06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
specify them
 
06:55:29.590 --> 06:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
moral recognition therapy choose love
 
06:55:31.110 --> 06:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
thinking for a change
 
06:55:32.868 --> 06:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
and say they'd be eligible for six
 
06:55:32.878 --> 06:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
and say they'd be eligible for six
months

06:55:33.910 --> 06:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
months
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
and decide whether you want to include
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
the programs that are on the tablet
 
06:55:40.868 --> 06:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
through the cri was the corrections
 
06:55:42.948 --> 06:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
research institute i think it was
 
06:55:42.958 --> 06:55:44.548 align:start position:0%
research institute i think it was
rehabilitation

06:55:44.548 --> 06:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
 
06:55:44.558 --> 06:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
yeah

06:55:45.510 --> 06:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:55:47.430 --> 06:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i mean i mean that's one way you
 
06:55:49.830 --> 06:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
could approach
 
06:55:49.840 --> 06:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
could approach
follow-up

06:55:51.590 --> 06:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:55:53.510 --> 06:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure i understand
 
06:55:55.270 --> 06:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
your answer that
 
06:55:56.468 --> 06:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
if we
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
fix these tablet programs and evaluate
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
them correctly and if they have merit
 
06:56:02.948 --> 06:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
that they should fall in with other
 
06:56:06.150 --> 06:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
programs but you would be opposed to the
 
06:56:08.310 --> 06:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill as currently written where it only
 
06:56:10.070 --> 06:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
says there is a one-time use and i think
 
06:56:13.030 --> 06:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
that means all of the programs so far
 
06:56:14.390 --> 06:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of programs that are
 
06:56:16.150 --> 06:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
currently offered under other that are
 
06:56:18.230 --> 06:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
worth it i think if they take moral
 
06:56:20.708 --> 06:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
recognition therapy and they do thinking
 
06:56:23.670 --> 06:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
for a change or choose love they ought
 
06:56:25.350 --> 06:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for the
 
06:56:27.670 --> 06:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
60 days for each of those programs it's
 
06:56:29.350 --> 06:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
only the tablet programs that i'm
 
06:56:30.868 --> 06:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
06:56:32.708 --> 06:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:56:35.590 --> 06:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:39.670 --> 06:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:41.910 --> 06:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
my question i'm a little
 
06:56:43.830 --> 06:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused in some ways
 
06:56:45.190 --> 06:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
06:56:47.030 --> 06:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
tablets and online learning have become
 
06:56:48.948 --> 06:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
extremely common
 
06:56:51.190 --> 06:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
outside of prison settings
 
06:56:53.030 --> 06:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
so virtually every college i know of
 
06:56:55.990 --> 06:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
offers online colleges now
 
06:56:57.590 --> 06:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
online courses
 
06:57:00.788 --> 06:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
some colleges only offer uh online
 
06:57:02.628 --> 06:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
courses is your
 
06:57:02.638 --> 06:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
courses is your
issue

06:57:03.670 --> 06:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
with the fact that these courses are are
 
06:57:08.708 --> 06:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
on a tablet and they're not in an actual
 
06:57:08.718 --> 06:57:10.150 align:start position:0%
on a tablet and they're not in an actual
classroom

06:57:10.150 --> 06:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
or is it more with the content
 
06:57:13.360 --> 06:57:14.468 align:start position:0%
or is it more with the content
my

06:57:14.468 --> 06:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:57:16.390 --> 06:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
concern is that there isn't any
 
06:57:19.910 --> 06:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
interaction with an instructor
 
06:57:23.990 --> 06:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:25.990 --> 06:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
some of them are for mental health i
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
mean where it would be good to have a
 
06:57:29.510 --> 06:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
group discussion
 
06:57:32.150 --> 06:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's not like learning accounting and
 
06:57:34.390 --> 06:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that the online courses you
 
06:57:36.868 --> 06:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
can talk to the instructor you might
 
06:57:38.150 --> 06:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
type in your question but there's
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
interaction between the instructor and
 
06:57:44.788 --> 06:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
the the student
 
06:57:47.030 --> 06:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the these uh
 
06:57:48.788 --> 06:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
tablet programs that there isn't that
 
06:57:48.798 --> 06:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
tablet programs that there isn't that
interaction

06:57:50.150 --> 06:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
06:57:51.670 --> 06:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have a question
 
06:57:55.030 --> 06:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:55.040 --> 06:57:56.948 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up follow-up

06:57:56.948 --> 06:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
06:57:56.958 --> 06:57:59.110 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
um

06:57:59.110 --> 06:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:02.628 --> 06:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
do you think that there is a um
 
06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
a trade-off
 
06:58:06.468 --> 06:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh you know for example you're the
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and you have a
 
06:58:10.390 --> 06:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
couple of thousand prisoners
 
06:58:11.670 --> 06:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
06:58:13.670 --> 06:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
basically trying to rehabilitate but you
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
only have so many teachers you only have
 
06:58:17.030 --> 06:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
so many people who can lead these
 
06:58:17.040 --> 06:58:18.548 align:start position:0%
so many people who can lead these
sessions

06:58:18.548 --> 06:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
06:58:18.558 --> 06:58:19.830 align:start position:0%
sessions
so

06:58:19.830 --> 06:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:58:22.230 --> 06:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
my guess is is that
 
06:58:24.788 --> 06:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
the tablet programs came about as a way
 
06:58:26.468 --> 06:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
to multiply
 
06:58:26.478 --> 06:58:27.270 align:start position:0%
to multiply
um

06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:27.280 --> 06:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
um
just

06:58:28.070 --> 06:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:58:30.070 --> 06:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
to make more course material available
 
06:58:31.430 --> 06:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
to more people
 
06:58:33.670 --> 06:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
without the need to hire more
 
06:58:36.788 --> 06:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
instructors and and teachers so
 
06:58:39.190 --> 06:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with doing that in
 
06:58:40.628 --> 06:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
general no i don't have a problem with
 
06:58:43.590 --> 06:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
that at all so i'm still i'm still not
 
06:58:43.600 --> 06:58:45.110 align:start position:0%
that at all so i'm still i'm still not
understanding

06:58:45.110 --> 06:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
06:58:47.430 --> 06:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
your objection to the program content
 
06:58:47.440 --> 06:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
your objection to the program content
itself

06:58:49.030 --> 06:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
itself
 
06:58:51.110 --> 06:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
not the content it's the interaction
 
06:58:52.390 --> 06:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
between the instructor
 
06:58:53.830 --> 06:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the student
 
06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
okay because i i question the value of
 
06:58:58.468 --> 06:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
just reading something and doing a
 
06:59:00.628 --> 06:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
multiple choice test
 
06:59:01.590 --> 06:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's not the way i learn
 
06:59:07.910 --> 06:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schultz
 
06:59:10.390 --> 06:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's great to see you
 
06:59:10.400 --> 06:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's great to see you
here

06:59:11.270 --> 06:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:59:14.230 --> 06:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm a sub from concord representative
 
06:59:16.628 --> 06:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
schultz so apologize i'm not usually on
 
06:59:18.230 --> 06:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee but
 
06:59:21.030 --> 06:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
um two quick things one i've never come
 
06:59:23.670 --> 06:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
out about this as a legislator or in
 
06:59:25.430 --> 06:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
public in general but i have a learning
 
06:59:25.440 --> 06:59:26.948 align:start position:0%
public in general but i have a learning
disability

06:59:26.948 --> 06:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
disability
 
06:59:26.958 --> 06:59:28.070 align:start position:0%
disability
um

06:59:28.070 --> 06:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:31.510 --> 06:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it is amazing what the technology
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
provides if you have a learning
 
06:59:35.590 --> 06:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
disability all these advances with
 
06:59:38.310 --> 06:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
online classes have been amazing
 
06:59:40.708 --> 06:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
and i think i must also be slightly
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
dyslexic because you can now choose a
 
06:59:44.948 --> 06:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
font specification
 
06:59:46.948 --> 06:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
did you know that these
 
06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
advancements existed because it's did
 
06:59:51.750 --> 06:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
you had you heard that and then a quick
 
06:59:51.760 --> 06:59:52.788 align:start position:0%
you had you heard that and then a quick
follow-up

06:59:52.788 --> 06:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:59:54.788 --> 06:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
i know that there's a lot that's
 
06:59:56.948 --> 06:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
available online and that are tailored
 
06:59:59.830 --> 06:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
to people's style of learning i don't
 
07:00:02.468 --> 07:00:02.478 align:start position:0%
know whether these programs
 
07:00:02.478 --> 07:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
know whether these programs
sure

07:00:03.750 --> 07:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
07:00:05.910 --> 07:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow are so tailored yeah they're
 
07:00:07.510 --> 07:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
great on the kindle for whatever it's
 
07:00:12.070 --> 07:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
worth um and also uh
 
07:00:16.310 --> 07:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
i had tried a class on edx
 
07:00:19.910 --> 07:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
ed i think hyphen the letter x
 
07:00:22.468 --> 07:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
where a number of these courses are
 
07:00:25.030 --> 07:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
online have you looked at any of the
 
07:00:27.270 --> 07:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
course materials or any of the course
 
07:00:29.350 --> 07:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
content on your own
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
because i was shocked at how cool
 
07:00:35.030 --> 07:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
it was we asked for access to some of
 
07:00:36.948 --> 07:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
these programs and and it was not
 
07:00:38.868 --> 07:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
available to us that's true i looked
 
07:00:41.750 --> 07:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
online to one of the original programs
 
07:00:44.390 --> 07:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the peace education program and i
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
looked online for that
 
07:00:46.558 --> 07:00:48.868 align:start position:0%
looked online for that
and

07:00:48.868 --> 07:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's you know been used all over the
 
07:00:53.750 --> 07:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
world this is a wonderful thing and the
 
07:00:56.070 --> 07:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
examples they give online about this
 
07:00:59.670 --> 07:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
program are for in-person
 
07:01:02.390 --> 07:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
delivery of the program
 
07:01:02.400 --> 07:01:04.628 align:start position:0%
delivery of the program
interesting

07:01:04.628 --> 07:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
07:01:04.638 --> 07:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
interesting
representative

07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:09.270 --> 07:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:01:11.110 --> 07:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you thank you for taking this
 
07:01:13.190 --> 07:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
question for the
 
07:01:14.628 --> 07:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
history three
 
07:01:16.948 --> 07:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
looks like economics and financial
 
07:01:16.958 --> 07:01:18.628 align:start position:0%
looks like economics and financial
literacy

07:01:18.628 --> 07:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
literacy
 
07:01:20.548 --> 07:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
do you have um
 
07:01:22.390 --> 07:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
what grade level
 
07:01:25.030 --> 07:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
do you think they would be i don't know
 
07:01:27.270 --> 07:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i believe that most of the programs
 
07:01:30.070 --> 07:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
are done at like this that was it fifth
 
07:01:31.750 --> 07:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
or sixth grade level
 
07:01:31.760 --> 07:01:43.190 align:start position:0%
or sixth grade level
um

07:01:43.190 --> 07:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:45.990 --> 07:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and and quick follow-up
 
07:01:48.150 --> 07:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
are these all if people are using
 
07:01:48.160 --> 07:01:49.430 align:start position:0%
are these all if people are using
tablets

07:01:49.430 --> 07:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
tablets
 
07:01:52.230 --> 07:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
are they do they have an option to use a
 
07:01:54.390 --> 07:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
language other than english
 
07:01:59.190 --> 07:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:07.350 --> 07:02:07.360 align:start position:0%

as you well are aware

of the city
 
07:04:40.150 --> 07:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and was served on the first public
 
07:04:43.350 --> 07:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
advisory committee ever since then i've
 
07:04:46.070 --> 07:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
been working with our veterans and the
 
07:04:47.750 --> 07:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
reason i'm here today
 
07:04:49.030 --> 07:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
is to address
 
07:04:50.390 --> 07:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:04:50.400 --> 07:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
the bill
in

07:04:51.510 --> 07:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:04:54.070 --> 07:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
in advocating for our veterans
 
07:04:55.270 --> 07:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
those of you
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
who have served are very familiar with
 
07:04:57.680 --> 07:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
who have served are very familiar with
post-traumatic

07:04:59.350 --> 07:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic
 
07:05:01.990 --> 07:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
stress disorder i for one am very
 
07:05:04.230 --> 07:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with it and the reason i bring
 
07:05:05.910 --> 07:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
that up is that
 
07:05:09.190 --> 07:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have had friends as a vietnam war vet
 
07:05:11.750 --> 07:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
have returned to the states
 
07:05:14.070 --> 07:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
have committed suicide
 
07:05:16.230 --> 07:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
have caused problems with their family
 
07:05:18.310 --> 07:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
members i've had children have asked
 
07:05:20.548 --> 07:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with my father i've had
 
07:05:23.430 --> 07:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
wives ask i can't recognize my husband
 
07:05:23.440 --> 07:05:24.468 align:start position:0%
wives ask i can't recognize my husband
anymore

07:05:24.468 --> 07:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
07:05:26.390 --> 07:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
and there are situations where something
 
07:05:26.400 --> 07:05:27.430 align:start position:0%
and there are situations where something
triggers

07:05:27.430 --> 07:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
triggers
 
07:05:30.628 --> 07:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
a returning veteran with ps pstd
 
07:05:34.628 --> 07:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
that causes you know a criminal offense
 
07:05:37.110 --> 07:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
that being said i'm advocating for the
 
07:05:39.670 --> 07:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
veterans because
 
07:05:42.868 --> 07:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
this bill i think if looking at what the
 
07:05:44.468 --> 07:05:44.478 align:start position:0%
variable should be
 
07:05:47.270 --> 07:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think ptsd should weigh very very
 
07:05:47.280 --> 07:05:48.548 align:start position:0%
i think ptsd should weigh very very
heavily

07:05:48.548 --> 07:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
07:05:51.110 --> 07:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
followed by if they're a model model
 
07:05:51.120 --> 07:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
followed by if they're a model model
inmate

07:05:52.390 --> 07:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
inmate
 
07:05:54.868 --> 07:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
as well as letters of support from the
 
07:05:58.390 --> 07:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
correctional officers and the warden of
 
07:06:02.708 --> 07:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:02.718 --> 07:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
it's

07:06:03.750 --> 07:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:06:05.430 --> 07:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
07:06:07.030 --> 07:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm it you know i'm
 
07:06:08.468 --> 07:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
support of the bill it's really
 
07:06:11.110 --> 07:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
advocating for the veterans but for all
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
people the situation back then 25 30 40
 
07:06:17.750 --> 07:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
years ago very little was known about
 
07:06:20.948 --> 07:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder i am not
 
07:06:23.190 --> 07:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
faulting the courts at all given what
 
07:06:25.430 --> 07:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
they had before them i think they did
 
07:06:27.030 --> 07:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
things correctly
 
07:06:29.030 --> 07:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
what has come to light is what has
 
07:06:30.788 --> 07:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
followed up in the information we know
 
07:06:32.468 --> 07:06:32.478 align:start position:0%
about ptsd
 
07:06:38.468 --> 07:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:41.910 --> 07:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
request for reevaluation of his parole
 
07:06:44.310 --> 07:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
and given those variables
 
07:06:46.310 --> 07:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
weighted correctly and particularly with
 
07:06:46.320 --> 07:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
weighted correctly and particularly with
ptsd

07:06:47.670 --> 07:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
ptsd
 
07:06:50.548 --> 07:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
may come out with a different outcome
 
07:06:53.110 --> 07:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
now there is a cost associated with this
 
07:06:55.190 --> 07:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
but then i asked the committee
 
07:06:57.670 --> 07:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know how do you weigh this i mean is
 
07:06:59.590 --> 07:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
it something that you know
 
07:07:01.430 --> 07:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know for somebody to be released
 
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
into freedom do we need way our
 
07:07:04.160 --> 07:07:05.590 align:start position:0%
into freedom do we need way our
compassion

07:07:05.590 --> 07:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
compassion
 
07:07:07.830 --> 07:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that it's injustice but i
 
07:07:09.430 --> 07:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
think the committee should realize that
 
07:07:11.750 --> 07:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain things given the
 
07:07:14.070 --> 07:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time that has elapsed
 
07:07:17.750 --> 07:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can we can look at uh the situation
 
07:07:20.548 --> 07:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
very objectively we have all been uh
 
07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
subjected to over the years
 
07:07:24.548 --> 07:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
those of us with white hair
 
07:07:26.548 --> 07:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh that um
 
07:07:29.910 --> 07:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
you may have been in favor of something
 
07:07:32.628 --> 07:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago but when new information
 
07:07:34.150 --> 07:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
comes to light
 
07:07:36.548 --> 07:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
your opinion has changed so that's what
 
07:07:39.430 --> 07:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm advocating for regarding this bill
 
07:07:41.590 --> 07:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
different facts and opinions may come to
 
07:07:41.600 --> 07:07:42.628 align:start position:0%
different facts and opinions may come to
light

07:07:42.628 --> 07:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
light
 
07:07:45.110 --> 07:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the in to benefit the intimate the
 
07:07:48.788 --> 07:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
inmate who is asking for parole
 
07:07:51.270 --> 07:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:53.990 --> 07:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
i will intimidate any questions but my
 
07:07:55.990 --> 07:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
responses will be only in french saying
 
07:07:58.548 --> 07:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
that i'm from a french city
 
07:08:01.990 --> 07:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:10.948 --> 07:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:13.750 --> 07:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
two questions uh number one
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
are we we're talking about 1512 which is
 
07:08:18.548 --> 07:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
07:08:22.310 --> 07:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
is looking for an earlier another parole
 
07:08:25.190 --> 07:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh look at it is that correct yes that
 
07:08:28.310 --> 07:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
is correct okay i was trying to get ptsd
 
07:08:31.430 --> 07:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
in this well no i'm i'm asking that when
 
07:08:33.190 --> 07:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this that
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
the parole you know uh
 
07:08:38.548 --> 07:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
i guess committee or people
 
07:08:41.350 --> 07:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration as a
 
07:08:41.360 --> 07:08:42.310 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration as a
very

07:08:42.310 --> 07:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
07:08:45.270 --> 07:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
important factor in looking at whether
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not the inmate should be paroled or
 
07:08:47.520 --> 07:08:48.628 align:start position:0%
or not the inmate should be paroled or
not

07:08:48.628 --> 07:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:08:48.638 --> 07:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
not
okay

07:08:49.910 --> 07:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:08:53.670 --> 07:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
one last question there's one
 
07:08:55.190 --> 07:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
where did you come from
 
07:08:55.200 --> 07:08:56.070 align:start position:0%
where did you come from
okay

07:08:56.070 --> 07:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:08:56.080 --> 07:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

07:08:57.190 --> 07:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:08:58.548 --> 07:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:09:00.868 --> 07:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
it says says in here
 
07:09:00.878 --> 07:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
it says says in here
that

07:09:01.990 --> 07:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:09:03.430 --> 07:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be good to have
 
07:09:06.548 --> 07:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
a pro a parole hearing on anybody who
 
07:09:09.110 --> 07:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
has over 25 years is that just sort of a
 
07:09:11.430 --> 07:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
blanket we're going to review everybody
 
07:09:14.070 --> 07:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
that has 25 years of
 
07:09:16.150 --> 07:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration well
 
07:09:17.990 --> 07:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i mentioned that there has to
 
07:09:20.708 --> 07:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
be certain factors or criteria that the
 
07:09:23.110 --> 07:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
inmate has to be
 
07:09:25.190 --> 07:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
a modeled inmate
 
07:09:27.190 --> 07:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
that they have letters of support by
 
07:09:29.750 --> 07:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
correctional officers as well as from
 
07:09:32.788 --> 07:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
the warden so not all inmates who have
 
07:09:35.510 --> 07:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
been there for 25 30 years or more would
 
07:09:39.270 --> 07:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
qualify under those variables
 
07:09:42.150 --> 07:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:43.590 --> 07:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
07:09:45.910 --> 07:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
just just a question but am i innocent
 
07:09:48.070 --> 07:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
the i mean i understand that might be
 
07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
your intent but the bill as it's drafted
 
07:09:52.628 --> 07:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it just says anybody
 
07:09:55.750 --> 07:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that has 25 years no no i i realize that
 
07:09:57.990 --> 07:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you know i
 
07:09:59.670 --> 07:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
07:10:02.390 --> 07:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
a committee amendment may be in order if
 
07:10:05.270 --> 07:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the committee chooses to do so
 
07:10:08.070 --> 07:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:09.830 --> 07:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
just a point of order the representative
 
07:10:11.830 --> 07:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
is introducing the bill he's not a prime
 
07:10:14.310 --> 07:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
or a co-sponsor so be gentle with him
 
07:10:14.320 --> 07:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
or a co-sponsor so be gentle with him
please

07:10:15.350 --> 07:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:10:17.670 --> 07:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's all right i've been here 22 years i
 
07:10:19.590 --> 07:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
can take it trust me
 
07:10:22.230 --> 07:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
that i can dish it back too
 
07:10:24.548 --> 07:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:10:25.670 --> 07:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative connolly you had a
 
07:10:25.680 --> 07:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
representative connolly you had a
question

07:10:27.830 --> 07:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:10:29.670 --> 07:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
it was more a question of the chair
 
07:10:31.270 --> 07:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you you're recognized for
 
07:10:33.430 --> 07:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
 
07:10:33.440 --> 07:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
chairman

07:10:35.990 --> 07:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:38.390 --> 07:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
could we get a very basic two-sentence
 
07:10:39.910 --> 07:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
explanation of what this bill would do
 
07:10:41.510 --> 07:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
because my read on this
 
07:10:43.190 --> 07:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
of what this bill would do has not yet
 
07:10:43.200 --> 07:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
of what this bill would do has not yet
been

07:10:43.910 --> 07:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
07:10:47.670 --> 07:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:49.270 --> 07:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
well first of all that's not a
 
07:10:51.510 --> 07:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
07:10:52.628 --> 07:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
but at the sa
 
07:10:53.990 --> 07:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
i guess you're asking me to explain the
 
07:10:55.430 --> 07:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill what i would want to do is let the
 
07:10:56.948 --> 07:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
07:10:58.310 --> 07:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
speak and
 
07:11:00.390 --> 07:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
the bill's been introduced the prime
 
07:11:02.310 --> 07:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors not here representatives
 
07:11:05.350 --> 07:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
obviously filing on
 
07:11:06.788 --> 07:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
introduced on his behalf i would just
 
07:11:09.110 --> 07:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
let the testimony uh come out and then
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'll offer an explanation after or
 
07:11:12.628 --> 07:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
during the executive session
 
07:11:14.868 --> 07:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
may i ask a follow-up
 
07:11:16.948 --> 07:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
of your parliamentary inquiry of the
 
07:11:16.958 --> 07:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
of your parliamentary inquiry of the
chair

07:11:17.750 --> 07:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
07:11:17.760 --> 07:11:18.788 align:start position:0%
chair
yes

07:11:18.788 --> 07:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:11:20.230 --> 07:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill is it
 
07:11:22.310 --> 07:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
would do away with the sentence of life
 
07:11:27.110 --> 07:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:30.150 --> 07:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding in a short cliff
 
07:11:31.670 --> 07:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
notes version of it
 
07:11:33.270 --> 07:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you it's just good for everyone to
 
07:11:34.948 --> 07:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
to know what we're talking about before
 
07:11:37.190 --> 07:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
we ask questions and so on so i thank
 
07:11:41.510 --> 07:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:41.520 --> 07:11:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:11:43.270 --> 07:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:11:47.430 --> 07:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:49.190 --> 07:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay here's a dumb question maybe this
 
07:11:51.350 --> 07:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
is for help hi
 
07:11:51.360 --> 07:11:53.110 align:start position:0%
is for help hi
um

07:11:53.110 --> 07:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:57.110 --> 07:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of what i hear of and am i
 
07:11:59.670 --> 07:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
right in this if this bill reminds me of
 
07:12:01.430 --> 07:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
what i hear in other countries that
 
07:12:03.510 --> 07:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes a famous prisoner will be
 
07:12:03.520 --> 07:12:04.788 align:start position:0%
sometimes a famous prisoner will be
released

07:12:04.788 --> 07:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
released
 
07:12:07.590 --> 07:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
because they're really old or
 
07:12:09.830 --> 07:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
sick i remember that especially of the
 
07:12:11.990 --> 07:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
lockerbie bombing
 
07:12:14.948 --> 07:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who was convicted of
 
07:12:16.468 --> 07:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
the bombing
 
07:12:18.628 --> 07:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh was released
 
07:12:20.628 --> 07:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
because he had a serious cancer or
 
07:12:22.070 --> 07:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
something like that i mean is that
 
07:12:24.548 --> 07:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
really does that seem to be the intent
 
07:12:25.990 --> 07:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
of this is
 
07:12:28.548 --> 07:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
sort of compassionate
 
07:12:28.558 --> 07:12:30.150 align:start position:0%
sort of compassionate
release

07:12:30.150 --> 07:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
release
 
07:12:31.750 --> 07:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know thank you i'm sorry thank you
 
07:12:33.430 --> 07:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
for the question no i don't believe that
 
07:12:36.468 --> 07:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses that issue
 
07:12:38.150 --> 07:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a medical condition that's
 
07:12:40.628 --> 07:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
very severe and it can correct me if i'm
 
07:12:42.230 --> 07:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
wrong commissioner
 
07:12:43.350 --> 07:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
07:12:45.830 --> 07:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure for for allowing
 
07:12:56.310 --> 07:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:57.510 --> 07:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
this happens when it gets late in the
 
07:12:57.520 --> 07:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
this happens when it gets late in the
day

07:12:59.990 --> 07:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:01.830 --> 07:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
when the witness is done with his
 
07:13:03.590 --> 07:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
testimony answering questions if
 
07:13:06.548 --> 07:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
a question is asked and it's no
 
07:13:08.150 --> 07:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
no no it doesn't mean the person doesn't
 
07:13:09.190 --> 07:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
they don't get the answer they don't
 
07:13:10.708 --> 07:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
need it
 
07:13:11.830 --> 07:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:13:13.670 --> 07:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
that member of the public is signing to
 
07:13:17.750 --> 07:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:18.868 --> 07:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative do you have a
 
07:13:20.868 --> 07:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up or
 
07:13:23.110 --> 07:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
that was what you said was helpful okay
 
07:13:25.430 --> 07:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think you had an irrelevant tangent
 
07:13:27.270 --> 07:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
sorry okay
 
07:13:29.350 --> 07:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know well uh
 
07:13:31.910 --> 07:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
for a segway with that i mean i i work
 
07:13:34.628 --> 07:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
17 years in africa and i'm very familiar
 
07:13:37.670 --> 07:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
with prisons overseas believe me the way
 
07:13:40.230 --> 07:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
we treat our inmates here
 
07:13:42.788 --> 07:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
is unbelievably well they're well fed
 
07:13:45.830 --> 07:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
taken care of and whatnot i had friends
 
07:13:48.150 --> 07:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
that i had to go take out of kitty kitty
 
07:13:51.110 --> 07:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
prison in lagos and that was not a nice
 
07:13:53.430 --> 07:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
scene if you're in prison there
 
07:13:55.670 --> 07:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're dependent on your
 
07:13:57.750 --> 07:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
someone to bring you food clothing
 
07:13:59.430 --> 07:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
shelter everything because they do not
 
07:14:02.230 --> 07:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
take care of you so i really admire our
 
07:14:03.830 --> 07:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
prison system here in the way that we
 
07:14:08.628 --> 07:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:09.830 --> 07:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
saying new hands raised i want to thank
 
07:14:11.110 --> 07:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony the witness is
 
07:14:11.120 --> 07:14:16.230 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony the witness is
excused

07:14:16.230 --> 07:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:18.150 --> 07:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
the committee calls jeff stresslin
 
07:14:21.190 --> 07:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
07:14:21.200 --> 07:14:22.468 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office

it
 
07:14:24.230 --> 07:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
it just before the
 
07:14:25.830 --> 07:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
witness begins for members of the public
 
07:14:26.948 --> 07:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
testifying we're going to limit
 
07:14:35.270 --> 07:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:36.788 --> 07:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon again my name
 
07:14:38.628 --> 07:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
is jeff strozen i'm attorney general's
 
07:14:38.638 --> 07:14:39.910 align:start position:0%
is jeff strozen i'm attorney general's
office

07:14:39.910 --> 07:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
07:14:41.910 --> 07:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
our office opposes this bill for several
 
07:14:44.390 --> 07:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
reasons and i'll explain why
 
07:14:46.390 --> 07:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
first the beginning of the bill contains
 
07:14:47.990 --> 07:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
several claims that are offered to
 
07:14:50.390 --> 07:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
justify the passage of the bill
 
07:14:52.230 --> 07:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't look in detail at every single
 
07:14:54.390 --> 07:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
one of these but i did look at one to
 
07:14:55.670 --> 07:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
see how applicable it is to new
 
07:14:56.788 --> 07:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire because when you look at the
 
07:14:58.868 --> 07:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
preamble to the bill it looks like most
 
07:14:59.910 --> 07:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
of these claims are really not
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
applicable to new hampshire
 
07:15:03.990 --> 07:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
one of the claims was that we have that
 
07:15:05.990 --> 07:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
many inmates are serving extended prison
 
07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
sentences due to mass incarceration
 
07:15:10.390 --> 07:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
i checked and confirmed that new
 
07:15:11.830 --> 07:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire's prison population has
 
07:15:15.430 --> 07:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually dropped each year since 2017.
 
07:15:17.270 --> 07:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
in addition i found a news article from
 
07:15:17.280 --> 07:15:18.628 align:start position:0%
in addition i found a news article from
2018

07:15:18.628 --> 07:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
2018
 
07:15:20.628 --> 07:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
that cited inmate statistics that showed
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire had one of the lowest
 
07:15:24.468 --> 07:15:24.478 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates in the country and
 
07:15:27.030 --> 07:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was actually going lower at that time
 
07:15:28.310 --> 07:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
and i confirmed the department of
 
07:15:29.910 --> 07:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
corrections has actually dropped every
 
07:15:31.510 --> 07:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
year since then
 
07:15:33.270 --> 07:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
the article also revealed that new
 
07:15:35.110 --> 07:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire's incarceration rate was half
 
07:15:36.788 --> 07:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
the national average
 
07:15:38.868 --> 07:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
so based on the actual inmate numbers
 
07:15:40.948 --> 07:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire we do not have a
 
07:15:42.788 --> 07:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
problem with mass incarceration which
 
07:15:44.868 --> 07:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
would justify what this bill proposes
 
07:15:46.390 --> 07:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
which is releasing
 
07:15:49.670 --> 07:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
violent offenders from prison early
 
07:15:51.270 --> 07:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
the second issue with the bill is that
 
07:15:53.270 --> 07:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
it cannot achieve its stated purpose
 
07:15:55.430 --> 07:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
which is having the parole board review
 
07:15:57.030 --> 07:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
the validity of convictions and
 
07:15:57.040 --> 07:15:58.070 align:start position:0%
the validity of convictions and
sentences

07:15:58.070 --> 07:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
07:15:59.990 --> 07:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that's because the you'll hear from
 
07:16:01.830 --> 07:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
other witnesses but the parole board
 
07:16:03.430 --> 07:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
does not have the authority or
 
07:16:05.430 --> 07:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
capability to investigate those types of
 
07:16:08.230 --> 07:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
claims it's not within their purview
 
07:16:10.070 --> 07:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
instead inmates already have a variety
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
of avenues to contest their claims to
 
07:16:15.350 --> 07:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
contest their innocence to contest their
 
07:16:17.270 --> 07:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
sentences and that ranges from having
 
07:16:19.510 --> 07:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel the ability to file
 
07:16:21.910 --> 07:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
motions to dismiss motions for new trial
 
07:16:24.788 --> 07:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
the appeals process sentence review and
 
07:16:26.230 --> 07:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
state and federal habeas corpus
 
07:16:28.230 --> 07:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
petitions so there exists a system
 
07:16:30.390 --> 07:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the department of corrections
 
07:16:32.070 --> 07:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
to address the issues that are raised in
 
07:16:34.070 --> 07:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:16:35.430 --> 07:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
another issue that the bill doesn't
 
07:16:36.788 --> 07:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
account for is the fact that the
 
07:16:39.350 --> 07:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
majority of defendants plead guilty to
 
07:16:42.628 --> 07:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
their crimes and agree to incarceration
 
07:16:44.868 --> 07:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
so this bill would undo all that for
 
07:16:46.788 --> 07:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
violent offenders including murderers
 
07:16:49.110 --> 07:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
and people who committed sexual assaults
 
07:16:50.948 --> 07:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
even though they pled guilty
 
07:16:52.948 --> 07:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
admitted their crimes and agreed to be
 
07:16:54.948 --> 07:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the state prison
 
07:16:57.590 --> 07:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo that and allow them
 
07:17:00.468 --> 07:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
to essentially leave prison early so
 
07:17:01.910 --> 07:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
again these are not people for whom
 
07:17:03.350 --> 07:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
innocence or their sentences were an
 
07:17:05.030 --> 07:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue they agreed to those
 
07:17:07.030 --> 07:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
and again that would be obviously unfair
 
07:17:09.270 --> 07:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
to those victims family members
 
07:17:10.708 --> 07:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
the victims themselves and the
 
07:17:13.190 --> 07:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
communities involved
 
07:17:15.750 --> 07:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
the reality is that this bill targets a
 
07:17:17.190 --> 07:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
certain class of inmates and those are
 
07:17:19.670 --> 07:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
inmates serving senses of at least 25
 
07:17:20.948 --> 07:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
years or more
 
07:17:23.030 --> 07:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
those make up some of the worst of the
 
07:17:25.270 --> 07:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
worst in this state as far as offenders
 
07:17:27.030 --> 07:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
they include criminals who've murdered
 
07:17:28.628 --> 07:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
and raped their victims including
 
07:17:28.638 --> 07:17:29.830 align:start position:0%
and raped their victims including
children

07:17:29.830 --> 07:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:17:31.270 --> 07:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
some of those people who are serving
 
07:17:33.190 --> 07:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
those sentences have killed multiple
 
07:17:35.670 --> 07:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
people raped multiple people and are
 
07:17:37.510 --> 07:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
serving consecutive sentences for each
 
07:17:39.830 --> 07:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
victim so we have double and triple
 
07:17:41.430 --> 07:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
murderers in this state double and
 
07:17:41.440 --> 07:17:42.628 align:start position:0%
murderers in this state double and
triple

07:17:42.628 --> 07:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
triple
 
07:17:44.388 --> 07:17:44.398 align:start position:0%
rapists in this state they get a
 
07:17:46.788 --> 07:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
sentence for each victim so they may
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
have three consecutive 25-year sentences
 
07:17:51.750 --> 07:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo that and say after
 
07:17:53.110 --> 07:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
they've only served one of those
 
07:17:55.910 --> 07:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
sentences for 25 years they'll be
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole and could walk out
 
07:17:58.628 --> 07:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
of prison
 
07:18:00.468 --> 07:18:00.478 align:start position:0%
that's obviously not fair to any of
 
07:18:02.310 --> 07:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
those victims involved each victim
 
07:18:02.320 --> 07:18:04.788 align:start position:0%
those victims involved each victim
counts

07:18:04.788 --> 07:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:06.548 --> 07:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
this bill would also allow
 
07:18:08.230 --> 07:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
criminals who are serving sentences to
 
07:18:11.110 --> 07:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
get out early no matter how many victims
 
07:18:13.110 --> 07:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
they've victimized and no matter how
 
07:18:14.468 --> 07:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
many crimes they've committed again we
 
07:18:15.750 --> 07:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
have some people in prison who've
 
07:18:18.388 --> 07:18:18.398 align:start position:0%
committed multiple serious offenses and
 
07:18:21.030 --> 07:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
received multiple consecutive sentences
 
07:18:22.628 --> 07:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo that and let them
 
07:18:25.030 --> 07:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
simply walk out the door early again not
 
07:18:27.350 --> 07:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
fair to those victims or their families
 
07:18:28.948 --> 07:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
and finally as i think
 
07:18:29.990 --> 07:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
was noted earlier by another
 
07:18:31.750 --> 07:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative this bill would be in
 
07:18:33.910 --> 07:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
conflict with existing sentencing laws
 
07:18:35.830 --> 07:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
regarding murderers and people who
 
07:18:38.230 --> 07:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
commit multiple sexual assaults for
 
07:18:38.240 --> 07:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
commit multiple sexual assaults for
example

07:18:39.430 --> 07:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
example
 
07:18:41.110 --> 07:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo the sentences for
 
07:18:43.590 --> 07:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
all first-degree murderers so
 
07:18:45.830 --> 07:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
instead people who've committed murders
 
07:18:47.510 --> 07:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
during a sexual assault who committed
 
07:18:50.230 --> 07:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
home invasions and committed murders
 
07:18:52.468 --> 07:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
and people who committed multiple sexual
 
07:18:52.478 --> 07:18:53.910 align:start position:0%
and people who committed multiple sexual
assaults

07:18:53.910 --> 07:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
assaults
 
07:18:55.430 --> 07:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
those people normally be subject to
 
07:18:57.190 --> 07:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
life's life without parole sentences
 
07:18:59.190 --> 07:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo that and instead to
 
07:19:01.750 --> 07:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
be able to leave prison early
 
07:19:03.270 --> 07:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
we also have a law in new hampshire that
 
07:19:05.670 --> 07:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
says that people who murder children
 
07:19:07.590 --> 07:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
children of the age of 13 have to serve
 
07:19:09.750 --> 07:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
a mandatory minimum of 35 years in
 
07:19:11.110 --> 07:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
prison before they're eligible for
 
07:19:14.548 --> 07:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
parole this bill would undo that as well
 
07:19:16.310 --> 07:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
and finally this bill would be in
 
07:19:19.350 --> 07:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with existing law that requires
 
07:19:21.030 --> 07:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
offenders who've committed multiple
 
07:19:23.030 --> 07:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assaults
 
07:19:25.270 --> 07:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
against children
 
07:19:27.670 --> 07:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
those offenders are required to serve
 
07:19:29.750 --> 07:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
life prison sentences this bill would
 
07:19:31.430 --> 07:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
undo that and let them leave prison
 
07:19:33.430 --> 07:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
early at 25 years
 
07:19:34.868 --> 07:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
so those are all the reasons that we
 
07:19:36.310 --> 07:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill i'd just like to
 
07:19:40.868 --> 07:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
comment on one thing regarding ptsd ptsd
 
07:19:42.548 --> 07:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
is a potential defense that a defendant
 
07:19:44.150 --> 07:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
could raise if they're charged with a
 
07:19:46.388 --> 07:19:46.398 align:start position:0%
crime that is best dealt with at the
 
07:19:48.070 --> 07:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
time they're charged with a crime in
 
07:19:49.590 --> 07:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
court that's not something that the
 
07:19:52.230 --> 07:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
parole board has the ability to explore
 
07:19:53.910 --> 07:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
or investigate the time of parole that
 
07:19:55.590 --> 07:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
is something that a defendant
 
07:19:57.430 --> 07:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
could and would potentially raise at the
 
07:19:59.350 --> 07:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
time of their trial and they have lots
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
of avenues to do that at the time of
 
07:20:03.750 --> 07:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
their trial if they choose to do so
 
07:20:05.270 --> 07:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's everything i have to say i'd be
 
07:20:06.788 --> 07:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that there
 
07:20:11.110 --> 07:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:13.430 --> 07:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
07:20:14.708 --> 07:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:20:19.270 --> 07:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:21.430 --> 07:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
you said something about
 
07:20:25.190 --> 07:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:26.948 --> 07:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
gives the parole board some authority
 
07:20:29.590 --> 07:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to to look at a
 
07:20:34.388 --> 07:20:34.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:36.310 --> 07:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
but where do you see that
 
07:20:39.910 --> 07:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
where do you see that that
 
07:20:50.548 --> 07:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:52.468 --> 07:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
i'm reading it it just says shall grant
 
07:20:54.948 --> 07:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
a parole
 
07:20:54.958 --> 07:20:56.388 align:start position:0%
a parole
hearing

07:20:56.388 --> 07:20:56.398 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:20:57.430 --> 07:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:20:59.830 --> 07:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is intended to address people
 
07:21:01.430 --> 07:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
who've been over charged overcharged
 
07:21:03.750 --> 07:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
wrongly convicted
 
07:21:05.750 --> 07:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
or over sentenced that's paragraph 10 of
 
07:21:08.948 --> 07:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:10.388 --> 07:21:10.398 align:start position:0%
and so that what that says is that
 
07:21:11.830 --> 07:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the parole hearing is going
 
07:21:13.350 --> 07:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
to be about to correct that and the
 
07:21:15.590 --> 07:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
parole board has no ability or authority
 
07:21:18.230 --> 07:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
to address those types of claims
 
07:21:20.708 --> 07:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
so those claims are all addressed prior
 
07:21:23.510 --> 07:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
prior to an individual being convicted
 
07:21:23.520 --> 07:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
prior to an individual being convicted
so

07:21:25.190 --> 07:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:21:27.670 --> 07:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's paragraph 10 in the preamble
 
07:21:31.430 --> 07:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:32.628 --> 07:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative you have a follow-up
 
07:21:32.638 --> 07:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
representative you have a follow-up
question

07:21:33.990 --> 07:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:21:34.000 --> 07:21:36.150 align:start position:0%
question
um

07:21:36.150 --> 07:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:38.788 --> 07:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
07:21:42.388 --> 07:21:42.398 align:start position:0%
you have a parliamentary inquiry yes
 
07:21:44.468 --> 07:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming mr chair that
 
07:21:47.350 --> 07:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through 30 or whatever it is
 
07:21:49.190 --> 07:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's the bill
 
07:21:50.868 --> 07:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
and the findings
 
07:21:53.990 --> 07:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do
 
07:21:59.670 --> 07:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:01.590 --> 07:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a parliamentary inquiry
 
07:22:01.600 --> 07:22:05.270 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a parliamentary inquiry
it's

07:22:05.270 --> 07:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:07.590 --> 07:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm just gonna underst that's
 
07:22:09.350 --> 07:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
a question we can discuss during the
 
07:22:11.190 --> 07:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
executive session uh members of the
 
07:22:11.200 --> 07:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
executive session uh members of the
testimony

07:22:13.590 --> 07:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:22:15.750 --> 07:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public can testify
 
07:22:17.750 --> 07:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and speak freely and we're not really
 
07:22:20.230 --> 07:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
going to debate what we debate them we
 
07:22:23.030 --> 07:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
agree with their interpretation or not
 
07:22:25.510 --> 07:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
we encourage everyone to testify and
 
07:22:27.750 --> 07:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll leave it at that
 
07:22:29.430 --> 07:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
i would say that as i read the bill
 
07:22:30.868 --> 07:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
those findings in the beginning are
 
07:22:33.190 --> 07:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the the reasons why the bill
 
07:22:35.590 --> 07:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
should pass that one through ten and so
 
07:22:38.548 --> 07:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's why i made the comment i did
 
07:22:44.310 --> 07:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:46.868 --> 07:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
there are avenues available through the
 
07:22:48.868 --> 07:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
courts to address
 
07:22:52.230 --> 07:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
wrongs such as excessive sentencing
 
07:22:53.350 --> 07:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
and things of the nature that are
 
07:22:54.388 --> 07:22:54.398 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
07:22:54.398 --> 07:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
brought up
um

07:22:55.270 --> 07:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:56.548 --> 07:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
is that not true that people could
 
07:22:59.190 --> 07:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
petition for for a rehearing on that
 
07:23:00.708 --> 07:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
there are lots of different avenues i
 
07:23:02.230 --> 07:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
mean originally a defendant would have a
 
07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
sentencing hearing where they would be
 
07:23:05.110 --> 07:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
represented by council and have the
 
07:23:06.948 --> 07:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
ability just to contest the sentence up
 
07:23:08.708 --> 07:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
front they can file motions for
 
07:23:08.718 --> 07:23:10.230 align:start position:0%
front they can file motions for
reconsideration

07:23:10.230 --> 07:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
07:23:11.910 --> 07:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
and for superior court or felony
 
07:23:13.830 --> 07:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
sentences a defendant has the right to
 
07:23:15.270 --> 07:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
go to what's called the sentence review
 
07:23:17.430 --> 07:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
board which is a three-judge panel and
 
07:23:18.948 --> 07:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
essentially have a re-review of their
 
07:23:20.468 --> 07:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
sentence as well
 
07:23:22.708 --> 07:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
they have other ways to contest it along
 
07:23:24.310 --> 07:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
along the road including habeas
 
07:23:25.990 --> 07:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
petitions in the state and federal court
 
07:23:28.230 --> 07:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
so there are lots of other avenues to
 
07:23:31.510 --> 07:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:35.750 --> 07:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
um my follow-up question is is kind of a
 
07:23:38.788 --> 07:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
tied to representative trues in in your
 
07:23:42.310 --> 07:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
luck way a few seconds ago
 
07:23:44.708 --> 07:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
does the court look at the preamble
 
07:23:46.468 --> 07:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
because does the court not try to find
 
07:23:47.910 --> 07:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
out legislative intent when they
 
07:23:51.030 --> 07:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
interpret a bill
 
07:23:52.150 --> 07:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
courts will typically look at
 
07:23:53.830 --> 07:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislative intent if there's an
 
07:23:53.840 --> 07:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
legislative intent if there's an
ambiguity

07:23:55.430 --> 07:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
07:23:57.190 --> 07:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
and certainly if the parties disagree
 
07:23:59.110 --> 07:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
about the meaning of a statute it's not
 
07:24:01.030 --> 07:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
uncommon for the parties to cite
 
07:24:03.270 --> 07:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislative history
 
07:24:05.670 --> 07:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
especially because this the preamble
 
07:24:05.680 --> 07:24:06.628 align:start position:0%
especially because this the preamble
here

07:24:06.628 --> 07:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:24:08.708 --> 07:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
says that the general court finds and
 
07:24:11.590 --> 07:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
then lists those paragraphs after so
 
07:24:13.350 --> 07:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
those would be important considerations
 
07:24:14.708 --> 07:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
if there was a dispute about what the
 
07:24:17.190 --> 07:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
terms of that statute meant but
 
07:24:18.868 --> 07:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
in fairness the statute is pretty clear
 
07:24:20.388 --> 07:24:20.398 align:start position:0%
which says that no matter what somebody
 
07:24:22.230 --> 07:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
does not no matter what crimes they
 
07:24:24.230 --> 07:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
commit no matter how many victims
 
07:24:25.910 --> 07:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to walk out the door at
 
07:24:32.468 --> 07:24:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:33.670 --> 07:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
07:24:35.030 --> 07:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the witness for his testimony and
 
07:24:36.548 --> 07:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
witnesses excuse me thank you for
 
07:24:38.468 --> 07:24:38.478 align:start position:0%
listening i appreciate it
 
07:24:40.388 --> 07:24:40.398 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls jennifer sargent
 
07:24:45.510 --> 07:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:47.430 --> 07:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman honorable
 
07:24:49.350 --> 07:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
07:24:51.030 --> 07:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm jennifer sargent i am the chairman
 
07:24:52.868 --> 07:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire adult parole board
 
07:24:55.350 --> 07:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
i speak in opposition to this bill
 
07:24:56.628 --> 07:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the new hampshire adult
 
07:24:59.110 --> 07:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
07:24:59.120 --> 07:25:03.670 align:start position:0%
parole board
um

07:25:03.670 --> 07:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:05.510 --> 07:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
what i believe this bill is doing what
 
07:25:07.670 --> 07:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
the board believes this bill is doing is
 
07:25:09.510 --> 07:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
violating the separation of powers and
 
07:25:12.468 --> 07:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
also uh serving as an end run around
 
07:25:16.788 --> 07:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
sentencing reform and that is because
 
07:25:18.948 --> 07:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
what this bill asks the parole
 
07:25:21.110 --> 07:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
board to do
 
07:25:23.030 --> 07:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
is to move
 
07:25:26.868 --> 07:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
the minimum mandatory parole date
 
07:25:28.548 --> 07:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
which is established
 
07:25:30.388 --> 07:25:30.398 align:start position:0%
by a court
 
07:25:32.468 --> 07:25:32.478 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
07:25:35.190 --> 07:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
authority of the court to determine in
 
07:25:37.110 --> 07:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
an indeterminate sentencing state such
 
07:25:39.270 --> 07:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire the minimum to be
 
07:25:41.910 --> 07:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
served and the maximum to be served the
 
07:25:44.708 --> 07:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
minimum to be served is the minimum
 
07:25:46.070 --> 07:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
parole date
 
07:25:47.510 --> 07:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
07:25:51.350 --> 07:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:54.548 --> 07:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
so that the parole board if asked to
 
07:25:57.910 --> 07:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
hear somebody at 25 years
 
07:26:00.150 --> 07:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
when their minimum parole date was
 
07:26:02.310 --> 07:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
either non-existent in the cases of life
 
07:26:02.320 --> 07:26:03.190 align:start position:0%
either non-existent in the cases of life
pro

07:26:03.190 --> 07:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
pro
 
07:26:05.190 --> 07:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
life without parole or
 
07:26:08.548 --> 07:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
was farther out than 25 years would
 
07:26:13.670 --> 07:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:13.680 --> 07:26:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
that

07:26:16.150 --> 07:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:18.788 --> 07:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
is a matter for sentence reform
 
07:26:22.070 --> 07:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is a matter for sentencing laws to
 
07:26:24.230 --> 07:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
be redrawn
 
07:26:28.548 --> 07:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
for penalties for particular offenses
 
07:26:31.110 --> 07:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
this the new hampshire
 
07:26:35.350 --> 07:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:38.628 --> 07:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
does not have as an executive branch
 
07:26:40.868 --> 07:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
as part of the executive branch
 
07:26:42.388 --> 07:26:42.398 align:start position:0%
the power
 
07:26:43.590 --> 07:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
to move
 
07:26:46.948 --> 07:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
a minimum mandatory parole date
 
07:26:51.030 --> 07:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:53.990 --> 07:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
by not only a judge's date but then
 
07:26:57.350 --> 07:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
something like burn time credit
 
07:26:59.190 --> 07:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
where some
 
07:26:59.200 --> 07:27:00.628 align:start position:0%
where some
trigger

07:27:00.628 --> 07:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
07:27:04.070 --> 07:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
some award some
 
07:27:04.080 --> 07:27:05.628 align:start position:0%
some award some
substantial

07:27:05.628 --> 07:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
07:27:08.708 --> 07:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
participation in that program allows
 
07:27:10.708 --> 07:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
them to work off
 
07:27:13.350 --> 07:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
portions of their sentence to change
 
07:27:17.830 --> 07:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:21.350 --> 07:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
this would also require
 
07:27:21.360 --> 07:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
this would also require
practically

07:27:23.990 --> 07:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
practically
 
07:27:26.788 --> 07:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
as attorney general sterling
 
07:27:26.798 --> 07:27:28.788 align:start position:0%
as attorney general sterling
argued

07:27:28.788 --> 07:27:28.798 align:start position:0%

who will not have the opportunity to
 
07:27:39.030 --> 07:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
engage in much programming
 
07:27:39.040 --> 07:27:40.388 align:start position:0%
engage in much programming
before

07:27:40.388 --> 07:27:40.398 align:start position:0%
before
 
07:27:41.990 --> 07:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting out because a lot of the
 
07:27:42.000 --> 07:27:43.190 align:start position:0%
getting out because a lot of the
programming

07:27:43.190 --> 07:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
programming
 
07:27:43.200 --> 07:27:44.070 align:start position:0%
programming
is

geared towards somebody who is going to
 
07:27:49.430 --> 07:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
parole very soon because you want the
 
07:27:52.468 --> 07:27:52.478 align:start position:0%
programs to be finished
 
07:27:53.350 --> 07:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
in a
 
07:27:55.830 --> 07:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
timely manner so that they can continue
 
07:27:57.670 --> 07:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
with that on the street
 
07:28:00.548 --> 07:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
someone who's engaging in programming
 
07:28:02.948 --> 07:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
a year or two or three or seven and a
 
07:28:05.350 --> 07:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
half years in is in a very different
 
07:28:06.948 --> 07:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
position than someone who has already
 
07:28:09.830 --> 07:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
served 25 years who is then engaging in
 
07:28:09.840 --> 07:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
served 25 years who is then engaging in
programming

07:28:11.590 --> 07:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
programming
 
07:28:13.830 --> 07:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of material that the parole
 
07:28:17.350 --> 07:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
board would also have to pull together
 
07:28:18.948 --> 07:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
read and review
 
07:28:19.910 --> 07:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:28:23.350 --> 07:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
extensive it would be years
 
07:28:26.388 --> 07:28:26.398 align:start position:0%
uh it would be all of the information
 
07:28:28.230 --> 07:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
that went into
 
07:28:31.190 --> 07:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
the case itself there would be many
 
07:28:33.670 --> 07:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
victims who would
 
07:28:36.548 --> 07:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
present themselves however we would not
 
07:28:39.510 --> 07:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:42.788 --> 07:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
have all of the input from the members
 
07:28:47.270 --> 07:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
who engaged in the prosecution
 
07:28:48.628 --> 07:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
like a judge
 
07:28:51.030 --> 07:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
would do at a sentencing hearing i am
 
07:28:53.990 --> 07:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
also a former district court judge now
 
07:28:55.670 --> 07:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
the circuit court but at the time i
 
07:28:57.270 --> 07:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
served as a district court judge it was
 
07:28:59.510 --> 07:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the district court i was in lancaster
 
07:29:01.190 --> 07:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
littleton in haverhill those were my
 
07:29:03.270 --> 07:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
courts and i circuited around the state
 
07:29:05.190 --> 07:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and i can tell you what
 
07:29:07.430 --> 07:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
goes into a sentence be it a house of
 
07:29:10.310 --> 07:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
correction sentence or
 
07:29:13.270 --> 07:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
a felony sentence to prison
 
07:29:15.110 --> 07:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the work that a
 
07:29:17.910 --> 07:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
judge must do to figure out
 
07:29:19.750 --> 07:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
all of the factors
 
07:29:19.760 --> 07:29:20.548 align:start position:0%
all of the factors
cr

07:29:20.548 --> 07:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
cr
 
07:29:23.590 --> 07:29:23.600 align:start position:0%

07:29:26.788 --> 07:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
implications
 
07:29:28.948 --> 07:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
how likely the person is
 
07:29:28.958 --> 07:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
how likely the person is
to

07:29:30.310 --> 07:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:29:32.388 --> 07:29:32.398 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate all of the things that a
 
07:29:34.468 --> 07:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
judge considers the parole board would
 
07:29:37.190 --> 07:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
not have it have in front of it
 
07:29:38.708 --> 07:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
it would have to be
 
07:29:40.628 --> 07:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
a significant retrial
 
07:29:40.638 --> 07:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
a significant retrial
basically

07:29:42.230 --> 07:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
basically
 
07:29:44.070 --> 07:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not the person
 
07:29:46.628 --> 07:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
should get out at 25 years
 
07:29:48.788 --> 07:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
and most of the applications under the
 
07:29:51.110 --> 07:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
current criteria for parole which are in
 
07:29:53.670 --> 07:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
the par administrative rules
 
07:29:56.230 --> 07:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
would not be met
 
07:29:59.110 --> 07:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
i would ask that the committee
 
07:30:01.910 --> 07:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
find this bill inexpedient to legislate
 
07:30:04.788 --> 07:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
and i will receive any questions that
 
07:30:06.070 --> 07:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
you would
 
07:30:10.948 --> 07:30:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:12.230 --> 07:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised i want to thank the
 
07:30:14.150 --> 07:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
witness for our testimony thank you is
 
07:30:17.670 --> 07:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:23.990 --> 07:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:24.000 --> 07:30:24.948 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

07:30:24.948 --> 07:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:30:28.230 --> 07:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same same thing
 
07:30:29.990 --> 07:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh for the record helen
 
07:30:31.190 --> 07:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
hanks commissioner of the department of
 
07:30:32.868 --> 07:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
corrections um
 
07:30:35.110 --> 07:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
just an affirmation yes the prison
 
07:30:36.628 --> 07:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
population actually has been on a
 
07:30:38.868 --> 07:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
decline since 2011. i'll send that to
 
07:30:40.948 --> 07:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
the committee it's i think a very good
 
07:30:42.388 --> 07:30:42.398 align:start position:0%
statistic for the state of new hampshire
 
07:30:44.230 --> 07:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're 38
 
07:30:45.990 --> 07:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
down on our population rate that's good
 
07:30:47.350 --> 07:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
for corrections because our staffing
 
07:30:49.670 --> 07:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone up yet and we're almost to
 
07:30:51.910 --> 07:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
the actually design capacity from circa
 
07:30:55.030 --> 07:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
1980 whatever for the men's prison
 
07:30:58.150 --> 07:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
sorry so with that said lines 27 and so
 
07:30:59.750 --> 07:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
on where it references the commissioner
 
07:31:01.430 --> 07:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
she'll grant a parole hearing and the
 
07:31:03.830 --> 07:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall schedule a hearing
 
07:31:05.270 --> 07:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner correction has no
 
07:31:06.868 --> 07:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
authority over the adult parole board
 
07:31:09.270 --> 07:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's fundamentally flawed so you could
 
07:31:11.110 --> 07:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
compel me to compel them to have a
 
07:31:13.030 --> 07:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
hearing but they could just simply tell
 
07:31:14.628 --> 07:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
me no
 
07:31:16.948 --> 07:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
so for those purposes i think it's not
 
07:31:19.030 --> 07:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
well articulated bill at this point
 
07:31:20.628 --> 07:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
because it confuses and creates
 
07:31:22.150 --> 07:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
authority where authority doesn't exist
 
07:31:24.310 --> 07:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
for the position of commissioner
 
07:31:26.388 --> 07:31:26.398 align:start position:0%
and just a point of clarification people
 
07:31:28.310 --> 07:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated with these lengths
 
07:31:30.628 --> 07:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
of sentences do have steady access to
 
07:31:32.230 --> 07:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
treatment interventions education and
 
07:31:33.910 --> 07:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
programming they don't have to wait for
 
07:31:35.190 --> 07:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
those i just want to make sure the
 
07:31:36.788 --> 07:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
committee knows that
 
07:31:38.628 --> 07:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate the information shared
 
07:31:40.708 --> 07:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
by the chair of the adult parole board
 
07:31:41.670 --> 07:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to keep this
 
07:31:43.510 --> 07:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
testimony short and answer any questions
 
07:31:47.270 --> 07:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:49.510 --> 07:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative board name
 
07:31:52.230 --> 07:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
pikachu thank you for taking my question
 
07:31:52.240 --> 07:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
pikachu thank you for taking my question
um

07:31:53.510 --> 07:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:56.310 --> 07:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
actually i have two but we'll see
 
07:31:57.990 --> 07:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
where the first one goes
 
07:31:58.000 --> 07:32:00.150 align:start position:0%
where the first one goes
um

07:32:00.150 --> 07:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:01.590 --> 07:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
do you ever
 
07:32:01.600 --> 07:32:02.548 align:start position:0%
do you ever
see

07:32:02.548 --> 07:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
see
 
07:32:02.558 --> 07:32:03.510 align:start position:0%
see
uh

07:32:03.510 --> 07:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:32:05.750 --> 07:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
people that have sentenced to long
 
07:32:07.190 --> 07:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
prison terms
 
07:32:10.388 --> 07:32:10.398 align:start position:0%
uh make uh drastic changes in their
 
07:32:13.270 --> 07:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
behavior so that they might be
 
07:32:15.990 --> 07:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
when they come in a murderer and
 
07:32:18.468 --> 07:32:18.478 align:start position:0%
a dastardly murderer that
 
07:32:21.590 --> 07:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the time 25 years has passed
 
07:32:22.868 --> 07:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
they've become
 
07:32:25.270 --> 07:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
quite different and maybe even
 
07:32:25.280 --> 07:32:26.948 align:start position:0%
quite different and maybe even
reformed

07:32:26.948 --> 07:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
reformed
 
07:32:28.388 --> 07:32:28.398 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner bourdain i would say
 
07:32:30.070 --> 07:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
that the answer to the question is we
 
07:32:32.310 --> 07:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
see people who come in with sentences of
 
07:32:34.708 --> 07:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
multiple links who make rehabilitation
 
07:32:37.270 --> 07:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
and reform um and we see people who do
 
07:32:41.990 --> 07:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
not so i see it in many other cases
 
07:32:43.670 --> 07:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up
 
07:32:44.868 --> 07:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:32:47.510 --> 07:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
um uh clearly uh you've shown us that
 
07:32:52.070 --> 07:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill is poorly uh worded
 
07:32:52.080 --> 07:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill is poorly uh worded
uh

07:32:53.110 --> 07:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:32:56.310 --> 07:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
is it possible we could make it
 
07:32:59.030 --> 07:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
more acceptable and
 
07:33:01.270 --> 07:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
possible to implement
 
07:33:02.628 --> 07:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative bordenay i would leave
 
07:33:04.788 --> 07:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
that to the fine deter determination of
 
07:33:06.628 --> 07:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
this committee again as the commissioner
 
07:33:08.388 --> 07:33:08.398 align:start position:0%
corrections i will leave sentencing and
 
07:33:09.990 --> 07:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
everything pre-incarceration to the
 
07:33:11.990 --> 07:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and the judiciary
 
07:33:15.910 --> 07:33:15.920 align:start position:0%

and an honorable discharge
 
07:34:59.270 --> 07:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i always used to
 
07:35:02.708 --> 07:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
say to my clients is just because you're
 
07:35:04.230 --> 07:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
a veteran doesn't mean that your
 
07:35:07.590 --> 07:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
experience is the same as someone else's
 
07:35:10.230 --> 07:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
with gary's experience i compare it to a
 
07:35:11.990 --> 07:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
cousin of mine
 
07:35:14.788 --> 07:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
who was actually an attorney
 
07:35:17.190 --> 07:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
at the embassy in saigon
 
07:35:19.990 --> 07:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
who never saw any combat so he came home
 
07:35:21.990 --> 07:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
without ptsd
 
07:35:25.830 --> 07:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:28.948 --> 07:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
when his trial was covered by the media
 
07:35:32.388 --> 07:35:32.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:35.350 --> 07:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
ptsd was a contributing issue but most
 
07:35:38.628 --> 07:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
people didn't know very much about ptsd
 
07:35:40.868 --> 07:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
things have changed considerably since
 
07:35:42.948 --> 07:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
that time
 
07:35:45.990 --> 07:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
ptsd now is known to be linked to
 
07:35:47.830 --> 07:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
numerous causes
 
07:35:50.708 --> 07:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
not just combat
 
07:35:54.628 --> 07:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
and it is much better understood
 
07:35:57.430 --> 07:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
you asked a question earlier about
 
07:35:59.750 --> 07:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
had she ever had any experience with
 
07:35:59.760 --> 07:36:00.868 align:start position:0%
had she ever had any experience with
people

07:36:00.868 --> 07:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:36:02.948 --> 07:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
i had two
 
07:36:05.350 --> 07:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
veterans down in massachusetts who were
 
07:36:07.350 --> 07:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
world war ii veterans
 
07:36:09.990 --> 07:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
who had the very same experience
 
07:36:12.788 --> 07:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
and they were let out at the age of 70
 
07:36:14.628 --> 07:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
because they both had serious health
 
07:36:14.638 --> 07:36:15.750 align:start position:0%
because they both had serious health
issues

07:36:15.750 --> 07:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
07:36:17.750 --> 07:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and until the time that they died they
 
07:36:22.310 --> 07:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:22.320 --> 07:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:36:23.510 --> 07:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:25.990 --> 07:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
gary immediately which doesn't happen
 
07:36:27.270 --> 07:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
very often
 
07:36:30.310 --> 07:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
took responsibility for his actions and
 
07:36:32.310 --> 07:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
turned himself into the police even
 
07:36:34.310 --> 07:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
before it was realized that a crime had
 
07:36:37.030 --> 07:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
been committed
 
07:36:40.628 --> 07:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
since 1983 he has worked on his issues
 
07:36:40.638 --> 07:36:42.388 align:start position:0%
since 1983 he has worked on his issues
relentlessly

07:36:42.388 --> 07:36:42.398 align:start position:0%
relentlessly
 
07:36:44.310 --> 07:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
and when the bill was
 
07:36:47.510 --> 07:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
up for passing a year ago he was highly
 
07:36:50.868 --> 07:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
recommended for conditional pardon
 
07:36:55.510 --> 07:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
even by his former prosecuting attorney
 
07:36:57.830 --> 07:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
he has incredible support from his
 
07:36:59.430 --> 07:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
family members
 
07:36:59.440 --> 07:37:00.628 align:start position:0%
family members
friends

07:37:00.628 --> 07:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
friends
 
07:37:02.388 --> 07:37:02.398 align:start position:0%
former employers
 
07:37:05.110 --> 07:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
the victim's family
 
07:37:08.150 --> 07:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
he has completed any and all available
 
07:37:10.708 --> 07:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
treatment programs within the prison
 
07:37:12.788 --> 07:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
as well as some of those that he could
 
07:37:15.110 --> 07:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
do via mail
 
07:37:17.510 --> 07:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
he is currently an inspiration in
 
07:37:17.520 --> 07:37:18.868 align:start position:0%
he is currently an inspiration in
particular

07:37:18.868 --> 07:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
particular
 
07:37:21.190 --> 07:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
to other incarcerated veterans and there
 
07:37:23.910 --> 07:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
are more than you realize
 
07:37:26.548 --> 07:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
and he works now as the facilitator for
 
07:37:29.910 --> 07:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
various therapy groups
 
07:37:31.670 --> 07:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the prison
 
07:37:34.548 --> 07:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
i know i understand this bill was meant
 
07:37:37.110 --> 07:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
for any and all individuals who have
 
07:37:40.388 --> 07:37:40.398 align:start position:0%
served at least 25 years with a few
 
07:37:42.230 --> 07:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
exceptions and i think that was the last
 
07:37:44.230 --> 07:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
sentence in the bill
 
07:37:46.788 --> 07:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
it is important however
 
07:37:49.510 --> 07:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
that each inmate seeking a conditional
 
07:37:49.520 --> 07:37:50.388 align:start position:0%
that each inmate seeking a conditional
pardon

07:37:50.388 --> 07:37:50.398 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
07:37:53.990 --> 07:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
be independently scrutinized
 
07:37:57.270 --> 07:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
and judge based on their own individual
 
07:38:00.948 --> 07:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and behavior
 
07:38:08.230 --> 07:38:08.240 align:start position:0%

07:39:47.910 --> 07:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
here for the past few hours is that
 
07:39:49.670 --> 07:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
you folks really earn your hundred
 
07:39:52.788 --> 07:39:52.798 align:start position:0%

for house bill 1512.
 
07:40:07.270 --> 07:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
um and i say that uh notwithstanding um
 
07:40:10.070 --> 07:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
the points raised earlier about the the
 
07:40:12.468 --> 07:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
problems uh with it with the the wording
 
07:40:13.910 --> 07:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
i i have to say uh with all due respect
 
07:40:18.628 --> 07:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
to the authors of the bill
 
07:40:21.590 --> 07:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
that i winced a little bit when i saw
 
07:40:23.910 --> 07:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
the references to people who have been
 
07:40:25.830 --> 07:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
falsely accused
 
07:40:27.110 --> 07:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
of crimes
 
07:40:28.708 --> 07:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:40:30.388 --> 07:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
are serving sentences
 
07:40:32.468 --> 07:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
this bill uh even though that was used
 
07:40:35.190 --> 07:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
to bolster the arguments for for support
 
07:40:37.030 --> 07:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill by the authors
 
07:40:39.670 --> 07:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
um it's misplaced and uh so i agree with
 
07:40:41.670 --> 07:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
with uh with the previous folks that
 
07:40:43.670 --> 07:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that spoke against that
 
07:40:45.910 --> 07:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
but i i don't think that that um
 
07:40:50.788 --> 07:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh washes away the the the uh the the
 
07:40:52.708 --> 07:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
forget the argument that that particular
 
07:40:55.190 --> 07:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
argument it doesn't wash away the the
 
07:40:57.910 --> 07:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill which is to
 
07:41:01.590 --> 07:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
offer some redress to folks who have uh
 
07:41:06.070 --> 07:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
served uh are serving extreme sentences
 
07:41:08.388 --> 07:41:08.398 align:start position:0%
one thing which is clear to me
 
07:41:10.788 --> 07:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
is that length lengthy sentencing that
 
07:41:13.350 --> 07:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
we've engaged in since the 70s
 
07:41:15.750 --> 07:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
has not made us safer if that were true
 
07:41:19.430 --> 07:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
the us today would be the safest society
 
07:41:21.750 --> 07:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
we incarcerate more people in this
 
07:41:21.760 --> 07:41:23.430 align:start position:0%
we incarcerate more people in this
country

07:41:23.430 --> 07:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
07:41:26.468 --> 07:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
since any time in recorded history
 
07:41:28.788 --> 07:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
but yet there is still
 
07:41:32.548 --> 07:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
we still face violence in our society
 
07:41:34.388 --> 07:41:34.398 align:start position:0%
more than 3 000 young people are
 
07:41:37.510 --> 07:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
murdered by their 25th birthday
 
07:41:41.110 --> 07:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
50 7 000 children survive
 
07:41:43.750 --> 07:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
sexual violence half a million women are
 
07:41:45.990 --> 07:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
victims this there's plenty of violence
 
07:41:49.510 --> 07:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
in our society but long sentences are
 
07:41:51.670 --> 07:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
not making us safer
 
07:41:53.270 --> 07:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here today as you sit in
 
07:41:55.030 --> 07:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
consideration this bill to ask your
 
07:41:55.040 --> 07:41:56.628 align:start position:0%
consideration this bill to ask your
indulgence

07:41:56.628 --> 07:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
indulgence
 
07:41:56.638 --> 07:41:57.350 align:start position:0%
indulgence
in

07:41:57.350 --> 07:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:41:59.750 --> 07:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking a more nuanced approach
 
07:42:03.430 --> 07:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
than we have previously brought to bear
 
07:42:05.430 --> 07:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to provide some means of
 
07:42:07.510 --> 07:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
redress to those serving stream
 
07:42:07.520 --> 07:42:08.708 align:start position:0%
redress to those serving stream
sentences

07:42:08.708 --> 07:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
07:42:11.430 --> 07:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes people who have committed the most
 
07:42:13.910 --> 07:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
serious sorts of violence those serving
 
07:42:16.388 --> 07:42:16.398 align:start position:0%
life without parole
 
07:42:19.270 --> 07:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is about how we talk about
 
07:42:21.030 --> 07:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
and how we treat people
 
07:42:23.190 --> 07:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
who cause great harm
 
07:42:25.590 --> 07:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
and begin to unwind
 
07:42:28.388 --> 07:42:28.398 align:start position:0%
an unsustainable and unwise policy of
 
07:42:30.628 --> 07:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
extreme sentencing
 
07:42:32.548 --> 07:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
we heard today uh before some of the
 
07:42:35.110 --> 07:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
previous testimony talked about the fact
 
07:42:37.510 --> 07:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that commissioner hanks is doing an
 
07:42:39.750 --> 07:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
excellent job that we've been cited the
 
07:42:42.310 --> 07:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire has been cited by
 
07:42:45.430 --> 07:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
u.s news and world report as as a one of
 
07:42:45.440 --> 07:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
u.s news and world report as as a one of
the

07:42:46.150 --> 07:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:42:49.590 --> 07:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
preeminent uh corrections uh
 
07:42:51.830 --> 07:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh facilities or uh systems in the
 
07:42:54.628 --> 07:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
country and that is all to be applauded
 
07:42:57.110 --> 07:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and it's and it's good to know know
 
07:43:00.310 --> 07:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
that our our incarceration uh rates are
 
07:43:01.670 --> 07:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
are going down
 
07:43:04.548 --> 07:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
um but that's not reason enough i think
 
07:43:07.430 --> 07:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
to abandon uh this bill or the or the
 
07:43:10.150 --> 07:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
people that that it would seek to serve
 
07:43:12.788 --> 07:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
i i'll provide you with some copies of
 
07:43:14.788 --> 07:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
testimony but i want to bring your
 
07:43:17.270 --> 07:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
attention to uh an open letter that from
 
07:43:20.310 --> 07:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh dated april of 2021
 
07:43:22.788 --> 07:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
and signed by 64
 
07:43:24.468 --> 07:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
attorney generals from across the
 
07:43:27.430 --> 07:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
country this is not just people from
 
07:43:29.510 --> 07:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
new york and massachusetts but states
 
07:43:31.990 --> 07:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
like texas and florida and everywhere in
 
07:43:32.000 --> 07:43:33.030 align:start position:0%
like texas and florida and everywhere in
between

07:43:33.030 --> 07:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:43:35.270 --> 07:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
and in this in this open letter they
 
07:43:38.708 --> 07:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
took they addressed the the uh
 
07:43:40.788 --> 07:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
the notion of of past
 
07:43:43.830 --> 07:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
past extreme sentencing so so uh
 
07:43:46.070 --> 07:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh miss sergeant alluded to the the
 
07:43:48.548 --> 07:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
notion about about well what uh what can
 
07:43:51.510 --> 07:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
we do to correct uh you know the the law
 
07:43:54.310 --> 07:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't rewrite the the uh the
 
07:43:57.110 --> 07:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
sentencing here uh this is this is not
 
07:43:59.510 --> 07:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh about sentencing reform this is
 
07:44:01.670 --> 07:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
asking for redress for people who are
 
07:44:03.510 --> 07:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
already sentenced
 
07:44:06.628 --> 07:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh to to the uh to uh life without
 
07:44:06.638 --> 07:44:08.708 align:start position:0%
uh to to the uh to uh life without
parole

07:44:08.708 --> 07:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
parole
 
07:44:10.868 --> 07:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
just to quote briefly from from this
 
07:44:12.388 --> 07:44:12.398 align:start position:0%
open letter which i'll provide you a
 
07:44:14.468 --> 07:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
copy with so you can see it in context
 
07:44:16.388 --> 07:44:16.398 align:start position:0%
but they say although the role of
 
07:44:18.388 --> 07:44:18.398 align:start position:0%
incarceration is primarily to protect
 
07:44:20.310 --> 07:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
public safety our criminal justice
 
07:44:23.190 --> 07:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
system has few mechanisms to sure to
 
07:44:26.070 --> 07:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that only those who still pose a
 
07:44:29.830 --> 07:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
serious safety risk remain behind bars
 
07:44:33.990 --> 07:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:34.830 --> 07:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:44:39.430 --> 07:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh the tough on crime appellation
 
07:44:43.670 --> 07:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
is not is the sole propriety of no one
 
07:44:44.948 --> 07:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
07:44:46.708 --> 07:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
with leanings on both sides of the
 
07:44:48.150 --> 07:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
reform issue
 
07:44:50.388 --> 07:44:50.398 align:start position:0%
need to feel safe in our homes
 
07:44:51.910 --> 07:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
and our neighborhoods
 
07:44:54.868 --> 07:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
no one wants to feel threatened
 
07:44:54.878 --> 07:44:55.590 align:start position:0%
no one wants to feel threatened
but

07:44:55.590 --> 07:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:44:58.788 --> 07:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
i i know of no one that that says that
 
07:45:01.190 --> 07:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be prosecuting uh
 
07:45:01.200 --> 07:45:02.070 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be prosecuting uh
these

07:45:02.070 --> 07:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
07:45:02.080 --> 07:45:02.948 align:start position:0%
these
people

07:45:02.948 --> 07:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:45:04.788 --> 07:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
when they when
 
07:45:07.110 --> 07:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
crimes particularly violent crimes are
 
07:45:07.120 --> 07:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
crimes particularly violent crimes are
are

07:45:08.230 --> 07:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:45:10.468 --> 07:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
are committed
 
07:45:12.788 --> 07:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
we all need to feel safe and and that
 
07:45:15.350 --> 07:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution has to happen
 
07:45:17.590 --> 07:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
my intent is not to engage in excuse
 
07:45:19.830 --> 07:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
making on behalf of the incarcerated
 
07:45:22.310 --> 07:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately each of us is responsible for
 
07:45:24.628 --> 07:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
our own actions regardless of the
 
07:45:27.350 --> 07:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances it is however important to
 
07:45:30.070 --> 07:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that violence occurs within a
 
07:45:32.628 --> 07:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
context and that understanding that
 
07:45:35.110 --> 07:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
context is a piece of the puzzle and
 
07:45:36.868 --> 07:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
ending it
 
07:45:38.070 --> 07:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
some people
 
07:45:39.510 --> 07:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
i do have to limit tests i did limit
 
07:45:40.948 --> 07:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
testimony in three minutes i i want to
 
07:45:42.468 --> 07:45:42.478 align:start position:0%
say that you're close to doubling that
 
07:45:42.478 --> 07:45:43.270 align:start position:0%
say that you're close to doubling that
time

07:45:43.270 --> 07:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:45:45.270 --> 07:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i need to ask you to wrap up
 
07:45:46.788 --> 07:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
07:45:49.350 --> 07:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
07:45:49.360 --> 07:45:50.468 align:start position:0%
okay um
well

07:45:50.468 --> 07:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:45:52.310 --> 07:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's tough here okay
 
07:45:55.910 --> 07:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
well uh you know let me just just
 
07:45:59.590 --> 07:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:02.948 --> 07:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh times when the legislations
 
07:46:06.070 --> 07:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
of this sort come up uh our thoughts go
 
07:46:07.430 --> 07:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the victims
 
07:46:10.310 --> 07:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
and uh and i want to speak in support of
 
07:46:11.990 --> 07:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
victims as well
 
07:46:15.430 --> 07:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
um the truth is that that most survivors
 
07:46:16.708 --> 07:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh don't
 
07:46:19.510 --> 07:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't live in the space between totally
 
07:46:21.750 --> 07:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
angry and totally forgiving they live
 
07:46:23.350 --> 07:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
someplace in the middle
 
07:46:27.190 --> 07:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that that allows for people
 
07:46:29.670 --> 07:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
that that are being that could be
 
07:46:32.548 --> 07:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
offered this opportunity for parole not
 
07:46:35.350 --> 07:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
to have mercy but to be accountable
 
07:46:38.310 --> 07:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
um to be accountable to the the uh
 
07:46:41.030 --> 07:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
in in in accepting responsibility for
 
07:46:42.868 --> 07:46:42.878 align:start position:0%

07:47:52.070 --> 07:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
just a hand there will be more more than
 
07:48:09.910 --> 07:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:09.920 --> 07:48:34.548 align:start position:0%
 
always

07:48:34.548 --> 07:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:34.558 --> 07:49:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

07:49:09.190 --> 07:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:27.430 --> 07:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:27.440 --> 07:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

07:49:31.510 --> 07:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:33.190 --> 07:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
this time we're now going to open the
 
07:49:52.868 --> 07:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:52.878 --> 07:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:50:19.190 --> 07:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:20.548 --> 07:50:20.558 align:start position:0%

07:50:32.948 --> 07:50:32.958 align:start position:0%

yell anything i'm just asking is this
amendment

07:50:39.350 --> 07:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:50:41.030 --> 07:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
is this does this rewrite the whole bill
 
07:50:43.030 --> 07:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
is it inserted into
 
07:50:45.430 --> 07:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
07:50:50.388 --> 07:50:50.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:52.548 --> 07:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
in a sense it does rewrite it
 
07:50:52.558 --> 07:50:53.670 align:start position:0%
in a sense it does rewrite it
but

07:50:53.670 --> 07:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:50:56.388 --> 07:50:56.398 align:start position:0%
initially the reason this amendment was
 
07:50:57.910 --> 07:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
drafted today
 
07:51:00.868 --> 07:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
was to satisfy a com a conversation
 
07:51:04.388 --> 07:51:04.398 align:start position:0%
between representative lynn and barcher
 
07:51:04.398 --> 07:51:05.990 align:start position:0%
between representative lynn and barcher
and

07:51:05.990 --> 07:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:51:11.830 --> 07:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:17.270 --> 07:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:19.350 --> 07:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's on line three
 
07:51:21.430 --> 07:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation means express
 
07:51:23.030 --> 07:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
questioning is
 
07:51:25.590 --> 07:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
associated with a formal arrest
 
07:51:27.510 --> 07:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
or restraint on freedom that is the
 
07:51:30.070 --> 07:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of an arrest
 
07:51:32.230 --> 07:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
or other actions or words by a law
 
07:51:34.070 --> 07:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
07:51:36.388 --> 07:51:36.398 align:start position:0%
which are reasonably likely to elicit an
 
07:51:37.990 --> 07:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
incriminating response from an
 
07:51:38.000 --> 07:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
incriminating response from an
individual

07:51:39.110 --> 07:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
07:51:41.270 --> 07:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
and occurs when reasonable individuals
 
07:51:43.350 --> 07:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the same circumstances
 
07:51:46.310 --> 07:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
would consider themselves in custody
 
07:51:50.708 --> 07:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that after um
 
07:51:52.948 --> 07:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
the discussion between representative
 
07:51:52.958 --> 07:51:53.750 align:start position:0%
the discussion between representative
lynn

07:51:53.750 --> 07:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
07:51:55.430 --> 07:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and bob's share that there was they were
 
07:52:04.948 --> 07:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:07.830 --> 07:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
that makes that makes two of us
 
07:52:10.788 --> 07:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:52:12.948 --> 07:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative antologues is this not
 
07:52:15.830 --> 07:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
already being done in our police
 
07:52:18.388 --> 07:52:18.398 align:start position:0%
stations within the state
 
07:52:19.590 --> 07:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
well i don't want to speak for every
 
07:52:21.590 --> 07:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
single police station but my
 
07:52:23.030 --> 07:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that the overwhelming
 
07:52:26.868 --> 07:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:28.948 --> 07:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
they will at least audio record an
 
07:52:32.548 --> 07:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
interview if not actually record it with
 
07:52:33.830 --> 07:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
it through a video
 
07:52:35.430 --> 07:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's being done what this would do is
 
07:52:37.110 --> 07:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
basically set up
 
07:52:39.510 --> 07:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
you'll make it a mandate
 
07:52:41.190 --> 07:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate for what it may look
 
07:52:44.070 --> 07:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
like but a mandate no less
 
07:52:45.430 --> 07:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
at the very least would downshift the
 
07:52:47.910 --> 07:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
cost to the counties and
 
07:52:50.070 --> 07:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
towns but any event
 
07:52:51.910 --> 07:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
it if it's not followed if for some
 
07:52:53.750 --> 07:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
reason whatever they didn't follow
 
07:52:55.830 --> 07:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
didn't record it any it wouldn't be
 
07:52:57.430 --> 07:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
admissible and neither would any of the
 
07:52:59.590 --> 07:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
fruits of the poisonous tree
 
07:53:03.430 --> 07:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
so that's what this would do
 
07:53:04.628 --> 07:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
some states have to take a different
 
07:53:06.548 --> 07:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
approach some states have
 
07:53:08.150 --> 07:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
they when they give the jury instruction
 
07:53:09.750 --> 07:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
they would just simply point out the
 
07:53:11.990 --> 07:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
jury by the way
 
07:53:14.468 --> 07:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
when this in this in confession was made
 
07:53:16.628 --> 07:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
this interrogation was done it was not
 
07:53:18.468 --> 07:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
recorded when it's the policy of the
 
07:53:21.350 --> 07:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
police department is to record it
 
07:53:24.150 --> 07:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
my question is what is going to be done
 
07:53:27.510 --> 07:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
if the departments do not do this
 
07:53:29.590 --> 07:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if they don't
 
07:53:30.788 --> 07:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
07:53:33.430 --> 07:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
procedure correctly as it relates to in
 
07:53:35.510 --> 07:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogations that
 
07:53:37.910 --> 07:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
any information evidence confession that
 
07:53:37.920 --> 07:53:38.948 align:start position:0%
any information evidence confession that
was

07:53:38.948 --> 07:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:53:41.270 --> 07:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
gained through that
 
07:53:42.868 --> 07:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation would not be
 
07:53:42.878 --> 07:53:43.990 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation would not be
admissible

07:53:43.990 --> 07:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
admissible
 
07:53:51.190 --> 07:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:53.430 --> 07:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative sue newman yes
 
07:53:53.440 --> 07:53:54.788 align:start position:0%
representative sue newman yes
just

07:53:54.788 --> 07:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:53:57.110 --> 07:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is your discussion time correct on
 
07:53:59.270 --> 07:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
this one um yes
 
07:54:01.190 --> 07:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no motion
 
07:54:03.750 --> 07:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's no motion recognized i just we
 
07:54:05.510 --> 07:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
just handed an amendment but we have to
 
07:54:07.270 --> 07:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
accept this bill today
 
07:54:07.280 --> 07:54:09.190 align:start position:0%
accept this bill today
and

07:54:09.190 --> 07:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:54:11.830 --> 07:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
i was i was pretty taken with the
 
07:54:14.310 --> 07:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
testimony of cynthia
 
07:54:14.320 --> 07:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
testimony of cynthia
muso

07:54:15.750 --> 07:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
muso
 
07:54:17.990 --> 07:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire innocence project
 
07:54:20.310 --> 07:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
and her comment that
 
07:54:22.868 --> 07:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
a third of confessions are have been
 
07:54:25.430 --> 07:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
determined to be false confessions i
 
07:54:27.750 --> 07:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
said to her during the uh the break
 
07:54:31.030 --> 07:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
between the the next uh the next hearing
 
07:54:32.708 --> 07:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
that there was just something this past
 
07:54:33.750 --> 07:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
week on
 
07:54:36.150 --> 07:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
public radio that i heard and it was a
 
07:54:38.230 --> 07:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
young person i don't remember if it was
 
07:54:41.190 --> 07:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
a young man or a woman but they were i
 
07:54:43.270 --> 07:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
don't know 17 years old
 
07:54:45.750 --> 07:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
and after hours of
 
07:54:48.948 --> 07:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
interrogation they had an audio of it
 
07:54:51.030 --> 07:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
they finally got him to say he killed
 
07:54:53.030 --> 07:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody when he actually didn't any and
 
07:54:54.628 --> 07:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
the person spent
 
07:54:56.310 --> 07:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
years deca
 
07:54:59.830 --> 07:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
over 10 years in prison um
 
07:54:59.840 --> 07:55:00.708 align:start position:0%
over 10 years in prison um
so

07:55:00.708 --> 07:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:55:03.190 --> 07:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
i was i thought that was
 
07:55:04.548 --> 07:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
just interesting with the whole thing
 
07:55:05.910 --> 07:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
that if it's recorded you've got
 
07:55:05.920 --> 07:55:07.430 align:start position:0%
that if it's recorded you've got
something

07:55:07.430 --> 07:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
07:55:10.230 --> 07:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
so i and i appreciate the listen if
 
07:55:11.270 --> 07:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're a police officer it makes your
 
07:55:14.150 --> 07:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
job a lot easier to record these entire
 
07:55:15.830 --> 07:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
interrogations because then it's all
 
07:55:15.840 --> 07:55:17.670 align:start position:0%
interrogations because then it's all
documented

07:55:17.670 --> 07:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
documented
 
07:55:20.788 --> 07:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
false confession aside whether it is or
 
07:55:20.798 --> 07:55:22.868 align:start position:0%
false confession aside whether it is or
not

07:55:22.868 --> 07:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:55:24.310 --> 07:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is a policy whether they should be
 
07:55:29.030 --> 07:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:30.708 --> 07:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
i think whether they record not you
 
07:55:32.830 --> 07:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
still can have the issues of false
 
07:55:32.840 --> 07:55:34.788 align:start position:0%
still can have the issues of false
confessions

07:55:34.788 --> 07:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
confessions
 
07:55:34.798 --> 07:55:36.388 align:start position:0%
confessions
so

07:55:36.388 --> 07:55:36.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:55:42.708 --> 07:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:43.990 --> 07:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to offer any
 
07:55:44.000 --> 07:55:46.788 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to offer any
comment

07:55:46.788 --> 07:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:49.590 --> 07:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
07:55:52.788 --> 07:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:55.510 --> 07:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
i am still looking at
 
07:55:57.910 --> 07:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
a 28a issue
 
07:55:59.990 --> 07:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
which is not
 
07:56:02.468 --> 07:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
a small issue
 
07:56:04.150 --> 07:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
in my book
 
07:56:08.230 --> 07:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:10.788 --> 07:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
issue that we cannot
 
07:56:10.798 --> 07:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
issue that we cannot
downshift

07:56:13.190 --> 07:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
downshift
 
07:56:14.628 --> 07:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
07:56:17.110 --> 07:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
explanations on why downshifting really
 
07:56:18.788 --> 07:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
isn't downshifting
 
07:56:21.270 --> 07:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
i've never understood those
 
07:56:24.388 --> 07:56:24.398 align:start position:0%
but i see this as a 28a
 
07:56:26.948 --> 07:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
um i
 
07:56:28.548 --> 07:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
i don't see how
 
07:56:30.628 --> 07:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
i can vote for
 
07:56:38.708 --> 07:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:41.350 --> 07:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
07:56:44.150 --> 07:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
07:56:46.150 --> 07:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
i would tend to agree with my colleague
 
07:56:48.788 --> 07:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
if if it specified the manner or
 
07:56:51.590 --> 07:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
machinery or storage
 
07:56:53.670 --> 07:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
that had to be used
 
07:56:53.680 --> 07:56:55.190 align:start position:0%
that had to be used
um

07:56:55.190 --> 07:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:58.708 --> 07:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:00.788 --> 07:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
every police department in the state has
 
07:57:02.788 --> 07:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
got some type of recording device from a
 
07:57:05.910 --> 07:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
phone to a pocket recorder
 
07:57:09.270 --> 07:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're used in wiring
 
07:57:11.030 --> 07:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're commonly used in police work
 
07:57:13.190 --> 07:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's not something that they would not
 
07:57:15.270 --> 07:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
have access to or would not be able to
 
07:57:17.990 --> 07:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
obtain very very reasonably
 
07:57:21.430 --> 07:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
um storage is a thumb drive
 
07:57:21.440 --> 07:57:22.628 align:start position:0%
um storage is a thumb drive
um

07:57:22.628 --> 07:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:57:24.548 --> 07:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
if we could make it better so that there
 
07:57:27.110 --> 07:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be a statewide database where they
 
07:57:28.468 --> 07:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
could share with the state police i
 
07:57:29.910 --> 07:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be great but that's not
 
07:57:31.270 --> 07:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
before us
 
07:57:33.830 --> 07:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
but um i i just think
 
07:57:36.150 --> 07:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
it keeps everybody honest i like the
 
07:57:38.548 --> 07:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
bill it makes
 
07:57:40.070 --> 07:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
it makes the police do better police
 
07:57:42.948 --> 07:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
work it protects the individual um and
 
07:57:44.868 --> 07:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
it's good for the system
 
07:57:44.878 --> 07:57:45.830 align:start position:0%
it's good for the system
so

07:57:45.830 --> 07:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:57:48.468 --> 07:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
as i said since i don't see a
 
07:57:51.270 --> 07:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
a mandate with regard to what type of
 
07:57:53.190 --> 07:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
equipment or how expensive they have to
 
07:57:53.200 --> 07:57:54.868 align:start position:0%
equipment or how expensive they have to
invest

07:57:54.868 --> 07:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
invest
 
07:57:56.948 --> 07:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could
 
07:58:00.948 --> 07:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
spend 20 on one tape recorder and
 
07:58:02.948 --> 07:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
and whatever it costs for the tapes and
 
07:58:05.350 --> 07:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's so minimal as to
 
07:58:05.360 --> 07:58:06.388 align:start position:0%
it's so minimal as to
not

07:58:06.388 --> 07:58:06.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:58:13.190 --> 07:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:14.388 --> 07:58:14.398 align:start position:0%
representative do you wish to be
 
07:58:25.910 --> 07:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:38.468 --> 07:58:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:40.628 --> 07:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
and stop calling me mike
 
07:58:40.638 --> 07:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
and stop calling me mike
um

07:58:41.430 --> 07:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:45.270 --> 07:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
i i move uh house bill 1540 uh
 
07:58:48.310 --> 07:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:51.830 --> 07:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
is there a second mr chairman i second
 
07:58:53.030 --> 07:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's been second by representative
 
07:58:53.040 --> 07:59:04.948 align:start position:0%
it's been second by representative
marston

07:59:04.948 --> 07:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:07.750 --> 07:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative lynch i i i
 
07:59:09.030 --> 07:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
tend to
 
07:59:10.548 --> 07:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
agree with my colleague that i think
 
07:59:13.110 --> 07:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is i think this basically is a good
 
07:59:15.750 --> 07:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill i don't really see the
 
07:59:17.430 --> 07:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:59:19.670 --> 07:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
the 28a issue uh
 
07:59:21.910 --> 07:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i think it's it's de minimis
 
07:59:23.670 --> 07:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
because i suspect that ever as you say
 
07:59:25.990 --> 07:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
every every police department has some
 
07:59:27.030 --> 07:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
07:59:29.590 --> 07:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
ability to make a recording the only uh
 
07:59:31.510 --> 07:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i do as i said before i think the
 
07:59:33.590 --> 07:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation thing that that
 
07:59:34.948 --> 07:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
the change
 
07:59:36.468 --> 07:59:36.478 align:start position:0%
would satisf in the amendment would
 
07:59:39.830 --> 07:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
satisfy me i i and i don't you know hope
 
07:59:39.840 --> 07:59:40.868 align:start position:0%
satisfy me i i and i don't you know hope
hopefully

07:59:40.868 --> 07:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
07:59:42.468 --> 07:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
all of you but would
 
07:59:44.070 --> 07:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
satisfy me the only other point that i
 
07:59:45.270 --> 07:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
would make is
 
07:59:46.788 --> 07:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
there the section of the bill that
 
07:59:48.070 --> 07:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
07:59:50.788 --> 07:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
it could be um
 
07:59:53.990 --> 07:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
you you know the the the person being
 
07:59:55.430 --> 07:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
the person who's being interrogated
 
07:59:57.830 --> 07:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
could waive the requirement
 
08:00:01.670 --> 08:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
of uh recording but that waiver either
 
08:00:03.110 --> 08:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
either had to be
 
08:00:06.788 --> 08:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
in writing or on the recording itself
 
08:00:09.350 --> 08:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i do think that's a problem because i
 
08:00:10.708 --> 08:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
think there are some
 
08:00:13.670 --> 08:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
i i've seen actually some circumstances
 
08:00:16.070 --> 08:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it's not uncommon
 
08:00:18.468 --> 08:00:18.478 align:start position:0%
for somebody who doesn't want
 
08:00:20.628 --> 08:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh their recording to be doesn't want
 
08:00:22.548 --> 08:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
their interrogation to be recorded
 
08:00:24.230 --> 08:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
to say i'm not signing anything and i
 
08:00:26.388 --> 08:00:26.398 align:start position:0%
don't want you even to record that i've
 
08:00:27.990 --> 08:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
said i don't want it to be recorded they
 
08:00:30.070 --> 08:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
just don't want to record it so i wonder
 
08:00:31.590 --> 08:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
08:00:33.750 --> 08:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
just end the sentence in which that
 
08:00:35.590 --> 08:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
appears in the bill
 
08:00:37.430 --> 08:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
to just you know
 
08:00:39.990 --> 08:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
stop it stop put a period before you get
 
08:00:43.030 --> 08:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
to provide it
 
08:00:44.388 --> 08:00:44.398 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion other than
 
08:00:49.590 --> 08:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:51.270 --> 08:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
good luck getting an amendment to the
 
08:00:52.310 --> 08:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
bill this
 
08:00:53.990 --> 08:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the problem we have up
 
08:00:55.590 --> 08:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
against the deadline but
 
08:00:57.830 --> 08:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
08:01:00.548 --> 08:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
08:01:00.558 --> 08:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
to

08:01:01.910 --> 08:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:01:01.920 --> 08:01:03.110 align:start position:0%
to
representative

08:01:03.110 --> 08:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
08:01:03.120 --> 08:01:04.788 align:start position:0%
representative
lynn

08:01:04.788 --> 08:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
08:01:07.190 --> 08:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
what i would argue with
 
08:01:09.430 --> 08:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
is i
 
08:01:10.948 --> 08:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
i think everybody should just shut their
 
08:01:12.388 --> 08:01:12.398 align:start position:0%
mouth when they get arrested but they
 
08:01:12.398 --> 08:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
mouth when they get arrested but they
don't

08:01:15.590 --> 08:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:17.430 --> 08:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
so with that said if they're stroking
 
08:01:19.030 --> 08:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
about not wanting to be recorded
 
08:01:20.628 --> 08:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully they have the mindset to say
 
08:01:22.070 --> 08:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know what i think i want my lawyer
 
08:01:24.468 --> 08:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to speak so i think
 
08:01:26.548 --> 08:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
that issue if we leave it in there is
 
08:01:28.388 --> 08:01:28.398 align:start position:0%
going to be taken care of by the people
 
08:01:31.510 --> 08:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
that will use that exercise you know the
 
08:01:31.520 --> 08:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
that will use that exercise you know the
constitutional

08:01:33.830 --> 08:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
08:01:35.990 --> 08:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
rights that they have to stay silent
 
08:01:39.270 --> 08:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
which they should um i'm looking at the
 
08:01:41.510 --> 08:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
28a issue and and
 
08:01:43.910 --> 08:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative roy you know almost said
 
08:01:45.430 --> 08:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything i was going to say so i won't
 
08:01:48.070 --> 08:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
repeat it so he is 100
 
08:01:48.080 --> 08:01:50.388 align:start position:0%
repeat it so he is 100
accurate

08:01:50.388 --> 08:01:50.398 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
08:01:53.030 --> 08:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
every police station has something to
 
08:01:53.040 --> 08:01:54.230 align:start position:0%
every police station has something to
record

08:01:54.230 --> 08:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
record
 
08:01:55.910 --> 08:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely they do
 
08:01:58.548 --> 08:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
so there is not a 28a issues that's why
 
08:02:01.350 --> 08:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
i put my name on this um that's why i
 
08:02:04.708 --> 08:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
support the bill so i am the third vote
 
08:02:07.830 --> 08:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
here and i'm going to be saying no
 
08:02:09.590 --> 08:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
to the itl
 
08:02:12.468 --> 08:02:12.478 align:start position:0%

although i understand your position
 
08:02:22.628 --> 08:02:22.638 align:start position:0%

i don't know about sandown's police

and video recording equipment as does
 
08:02:33.350 --> 08:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
every pc manufacturer that's in our
 
08:02:36.708 --> 08:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
office we can record with that
 
08:02:38.788 --> 08:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
the rockingham county jail the holding
 
08:02:40.628 --> 08:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
cells have video and audio recording
 
08:02:42.628 --> 08:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
already in place and that stuff is
 
08:02:44.310 --> 08:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
monitored by the guards it would just be
 
08:02:46.548 --> 08:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
a matter of sending that information to
 
08:02:49.430 --> 08:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
a file someplace in an already existing
 
08:02:51.830 --> 08:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure and file storage
 
08:02:54.948 --> 08:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
system so i don't see the downshifting
 
08:02:56.948 --> 08:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
of the costs and i'm very conscientious
 
08:02:59.910 --> 08:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
of that having trimmed 10 percent a year
 
08:03:01.430 --> 08:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
every year i've been
 
08:03:02.708 --> 08:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the rockingham county
 
08:03:04.070 --> 08:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
jail out of the budget which i'll do
 
08:03:04.080 --> 08:03:04.868 align:start position:0%
jail out of the budget which i'll do
again

08:03:04.868 --> 08:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
again
 
08:03:04.878 --> 08:03:08.310 align:start position:0%
again
friday

08:03:08.310 --> 08:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:11.670 --> 08:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents worth
 
08:03:16.150 --> 08:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:17.990 --> 08:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
once it's recorded you the police
 
08:03:18.000 --> 08:03:18.948 align:start position:0%
once it's recorded you the police
officer

08:03:18.948 --> 08:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
officer
 
08:03:20.150 --> 08:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they can't they should
 
08:03:21.510 --> 08:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
not be just leaving it on their cell
 
08:03:24.070 --> 08:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
phone for their own cloud service
 
08:03:26.388 --> 08:03:26.398 align:start position:0%
that it needs to go on to a some type of
 
08:03:28.948 --> 08:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
protected database somewhere
 
08:03:31.430 --> 08:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
similar how you know with the body image
 
08:03:34.628 --> 08:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
cameras so i agree the fact that every
 
08:03:36.150 --> 08:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
police officer presumably has a
 
08:03:36.160 --> 08:03:37.750 align:start position:0%
police officer presumably has a
smartphone

08:03:37.750 --> 08:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
smartphone
 
08:03:39.190 --> 08:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't rely on that officer to
 
08:03:42.788 --> 08:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
store on their personal cloud
 
08:03:44.230 --> 08:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that it needs to be
 
08:03:46.708 --> 08:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
uniform what i would say nor would that
 
08:03:49.030 --> 08:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
be appropriate
 
08:03:51.510 --> 08:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
no it would not have statutes that
 
08:03:52.868 --> 08:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
prohibit the distribution of a
 
08:03:54.628 --> 08:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
post-arrest photo
 
08:04:03.510 --> 08:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:05.510 --> 08:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
there would be a chain of custody issues
 
08:04:07.510 --> 08:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
supposedly they if a police officer
 
08:04:09.030 --> 08:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
recording their phone and whoever
 
08:04:10.788 --> 08:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
handled their phone
 
08:04:13.030 --> 08:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
perceivably has now handled the video i
 
08:04:14.788 --> 08:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
mean my son picks up my phone i have to
 
08:04:16.468 --> 08:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
add his name to the list
 
08:04:17.510 --> 08:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying these are these are
 
08:04:19.350 --> 08:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
problems with that it should be stored
 
08:04:21.270 --> 08:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
on a device and i guess that my thought
 
08:04:23.430 --> 08:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the unfunded mandate is the storage
 
08:04:24.948 --> 08:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
device is the
 
08:04:27.110 --> 08:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
issue not necessarily the recording
 
08:04:29.350 --> 08:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
device the recording device is a minimal
 
08:04:29.360 --> 08:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
device the recording device is a minimal
expense

08:04:31.830 --> 08:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
expense
 
08:04:31.840 --> 08:04:32.788 align:start position:0%
expense
represent

08:04:32.788 --> 08:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
represent
 
08:04:35.350 --> 08:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative pantologist
 
08:04:37.430 --> 08:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
the more i read this bill and the more i
 
08:04:39.110 --> 08:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
08:04:41.110 --> 08:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm beginning to believe it's a good
 
08:04:43.190 --> 08:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
protection for the police
 
08:04:45.350 --> 08:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the towns and cities
 
08:04:47.190 --> 08:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't really
 
08:04:50.150 --> 08:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
say that it was a 28 age issue because
 
08:04:53.350 --> 08:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
if my department doesn't have
 
08:04:55.350 --> 08:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
things to record and we're in big
 
08:04:55.360 --> 08:04:56.388 align:start position:0%
things to record and we're in big
trouble

08:04:56.388 --> 08:04:56.398 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
08:04:56.398 --> 08:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
trouble
so

08:05:01.270 --> 08:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:03.270 --> 08:05:03.280 align:start position:0%

08:05:05.030 --> 08:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
08:05:08.628 --> 08:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose the itu motion
 
08:05:11.510 --> 08:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
08:05:11.520 --> 08:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
i think that
the

08:05:13.990 --> 08:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:16.788 --> 08:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
person under consideration for arrest
 
08:05:19.510 --> 08:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
is already being recorded when they ask
 
08:05:22.548 --> 08:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
not to be recorded so that will be part
 
08:05:22.558 --> 08:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
not to be recorded so that will be part
of

08:05:23.350 --> 08:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
08:05:25.590 --> 08:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of
 
08:05:27.590 --> 08:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be recorded
 
08:05:27.600 --> 08:05:28.468 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be recorded
so

08:05:28.468 --> 08:05:28.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:05:31.430 --> 08:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we
 
08:05:34.310 --> 08:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl motion and
 
08:05:36.468 --> 08:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
08:05:40.310 --> 08:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:40.320 --> 08:05:41.590 align:start position:0%

well
 
08:05:48.868 --> 08:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
if if we get to that point i'll let you

representative marson
 
08:05:59.110 --> 08:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to make a
 
08:06:01.830 --> 08:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
note that the reason i seconded the
 
08:06:04.788 --> 08:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
motion to itl is that now we can have
 
08:06:06.948 --> 08:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
this discussion that we've been doing if
 
08:06:09.510 --> 08:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's no second it dies
 
08:06:11.830 --> 08:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
with that being said in my part of this
 
08:06:14.948 --> 08:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
discussion i have a big feeling that i
 
08:06:14.958 --> 08:06:16.388 align:start position:0%
discussion i have a big feeling that i
believe

08:06:16.388 --> 08:06:16.398 align:start position:0%
believe
 
08:06:18.948 --> 08:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative true is a hundred percent
 
08:06:22.548 --> 08:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
correct we are trying to pass laws and
 
08:06:24.868 --> 08:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
we ain't funding it and that's an
 
08:06:27.830 --> 08:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded mende mandate and that's going
 
08:06:30.788 --> 08:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
to cause a problem down the road that's
 
08:06:32.948 --> 08:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
going to flare up i believe that
 
08:06:35.110 --> 08:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
sincerely i may not be here when that
 
08:06:37.430 --> 08:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
happens but if you pass this that's
 
08:06:39.590 --> 08:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen unless you fund
 
08:06:42.548 --> 08:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
the towns the ability to record don't
 
08:06:44.788 --> 08:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
leave it up to them to maybe do it
 
08:06:47.670 --> 08:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe they store it and maybe they
 
08:06:50.468 --> 08:06:50.478 align:start position:0%
don't and so on and so forth and with
 
08:06:52.310 --> 08:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
all of what i'm saying
 
08:06:53.990 --> 08:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a lawyer
 
08:06:56.150 --> 08:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
man is a good lawyer going to take this
 
08:06:58.628 --> 08:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
apart and rip it up like nobody's
 
08:07:01.350 --> 08:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
business and so with that being said i
 
08:07:04.548 --> 08:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
will still itl i will vote to itl thank
 
08:07:07.430 --> 08:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
08:07:09.830 --> 08:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
08:07:11.510 --> 08:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
i would have not thought that this was a
 
08:07:11.520 --> 08:07:12.548 align:start position:0%
i would have not thought that this was a
uh

08:07:12.548 --> 08:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:07:15.110 --> 08:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate but uh in reviewing
 
08:07:16.150 --> 08:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
this letter from the new hampshire
 
08:07:17.590 --> 08:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
county attorneys there's 10 accounting
 
08:07:19.110 --> 08:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys on here that are not in favor
 
08:07:21.430 --> 08:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
of this
 
08:07:25.110 --> 08:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to lean that way i guess
 
08:07:25.120 --> 08:07:27.590 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to lean that way i guess
sorry

08:07:27.590 --> 08:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:29.590 --> 08:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
08:07:30.628 --> 08:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:07:33.510 --> 08:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious to know what the blue
 
08:07:37.190 --> 08:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
sheet reflects in terms of support and
 
08:07:41.350 --> 08:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
opposition and i texted to mr vice chair
 
08:07:44.230 --> 08:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
the online numbers it was two four and
 
08:07:45.910 --> 08:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
two against but it also lists their
 
08:07:45.920 --> 08:07:46.948 align:start position:0%
two against but it also lists their
names

08:07:46.948 --> 08:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
names
 
08:07:48.548 --> 08:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious to know if you have the
 
08:07:50.388 --> 08:07:50.398 align:start position:0%
if you have the blue sheet
 
08:07:56.070 --> 08:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:57.270 --> 08:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative wallace you happen to
 
08:08:00.628 --> 08:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:02.548 --> 08:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
this was the second day we had a hearing
 
08:08:04.628 --> 08:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
so the
 
08:08:30.548 --> 08:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:40.310 --> 08:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:40.320 --> 08:08:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:08:42.708 --> 08:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:43.990 --> 08:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
do any members wish to speak they
 
08:08:45.750 --> 08:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
haven't smoked already
 
08:08:48.948 --> 08:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
i i'm just gonna point out we had a
 
08:08:50.788 --> 08:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
bill involving body cameras and the
 
08:08:52.628 --> 08:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
consensus was that was an unfunded
 
08:08:57.430 --> 08:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:59.590 --> 08:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
so i guess how is this not
 
08:09:01.750 --> 08:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
is it because it's a minimal cost
 
08:09:04.310 --> 08:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
less expensive
 
08:09:06.628 --> 08:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
how how is there no cost because my
 
08:09:08.230 --> 08:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
concern is the unfunded mandate but
 
08:09:08.240 --> 08:09:10.388 align:start position:0%
concern is the unfunded mandate but
apparently

08:09:10.388 --> 08:09:10.398 align:start position:0%
apparently

i'm in a small group here so talk me out
 
08:09:31.670 --> 08:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:33.430 --> 08:09:33.440 align:start position:0%

08:09:37.430 --> 08:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
criminal act representative
 
08:09:39.750 --> 08:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative you are live streaming
 
08:09:39.760 --> 08:09:40.708 align:start position:0%
representative you are live streaming
yes

08:09:40.708 --> 08:09:40.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:09:42.230 --> 08:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
no no i wanted a
 
08:09:44.150 --> 08:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
concealed carry license out of florida
 
08:09:45.590 --> 08:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why they fingerprinted me
 
08:09:48.548 --> 08:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
because i had to do it uh but you know
 
08:09:49.910 --> 08:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
they told me when i walked into the
 
08:09:51.350 --> 08:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
fingerprint room
 
08:09:53.590 --> 08:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh you're being audio in video and i
 
08:09:55.190 --> 08:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't even being charged for anything
 
08:09:58.230 --> 08:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it the tapes are rolling
 
08:09:58.240 --> 08:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
and it the tapes are rolling
yes

08:09:59.110 --> 08:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:10:01.110 --> 08:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
and uh so you know if
 
08:10:03.270 --> 08:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know goffstown's not small but you
 
08:10:05.510 --> 08:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
know i know where which is small there's
 
08:10:08.150 --> 08:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
so many other small police departments
 
08:10:10.948 --> 08:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
they all record because they the biggest
 
08:10:12.628 --> 08:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
thing they want
 
08:10:15.350 --> 08:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
is they want to protect themselves
 
08:10:18.388 --> 08:10:18.398 align:start position:0%
and they want to make sure that whatever
 
08:10:20.310 --> 08:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the person that shouldn't be talking
 
08:10:22.708 --> 08:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
talks they want to make sure they get
 
08:10:25.270 --> 08:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
him exact because what he's going to do
 
08:10:27.030 --> 08:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
is he's going to tell his lawyer once he
 
08:10:29.670 --> 08:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
gets one go i didn't say that and then
 
08:10:31.830 --> 08:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's his word against their word well if
 
08:10:34.788 --> 08:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's a recording they can't do that and
 
08:10:36.628 --> 08:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
and i know every police station in the
 
08:10:42.230 --> 08:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:42.240 --> 08:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

08:10:43.750 --> 08:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:10:47.990 --> 08:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:51.270 --> 08:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's rather interesting two in support
 
08:10:55.110 --> 08:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:57.110 --> 08:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
would you please add who was for and who
 
08:10:59.510 --> 08:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
was against please
 
08:11:03.910 --> 08:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is public record no secrets here
 
08:11:07.350 --> 08:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:09.910 --> 08:11:09.920 align:start position:0%

association of chiefs of police is
 
08:11:27.030 --> 08:11:27.040 align:start position:0%

the innocence project supports it
 
08:11:35.430 --> 08:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
and uh joseph hoboke hollis pd
 
08:11:37.670 --> 08:11:37.680 align:start position:0%

08:11:40.310 --> 08:11:40.320 align:start position:0%

well with that being said i think we'll
 
08:11:51.270 --> 08:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:52.830 --> 08:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
08:11:56.388 --> 08:11:56.398 align:start position:0%
chair i do understand people are saying
 
08:11:59.350 --> 08:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
don't worry about the 28a issue because
 
08:12:01.190 --> 08:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
everyone already has all this stuff in
 
08:12:04.230 --> 08:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:06.548 --> 08:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
letter from the new hampshire
 
08:12:08.948 --> 08:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
county attorneys
 
08:12:10.628 --> 08:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
says they are opposed and why are they
 
08:12:13.030 --> 08:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
opposed because many of our law
 
08:12:14.868 --> 08:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement departments do not have the
 
08:12:18.230 --> 08:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
equipment which is necessary to record
 
08:12:20.628 --> 08:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
store and transmit interrogations as
 
08:12:20.638 --> 08:12:22.230 align:start position:0%
store and transmit interrogations as
mandated

08:12:22.230 --> 08:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
08:12:24.150 --> 08:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
our officers do not have the electronic
 
08:12:26.548 --> 08:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
storage capacity or the personnel to
 
08:12:28.548 --> 08:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
receive redact if necessary under the
 
08:12:31.750 --> 08:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
law and transmit
 
08:12:35.270 --> 08:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a difference of opinion
 
08:12:38.548 --> 08:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of county attorneys say
 
08:12:41.670 --> 08:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
all our departments don't have the
 
08:12:44.628 --> 08:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
facilities or the equipment to do this
 
08:12:46.868 --> 08:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
and there are people in this room saying
 
08:12:50.788 --> 08:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:52.230 --> 08:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
08:12:53.910 --> 08:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
for this itl
 
08:12:55.670 --> 08:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go with what
 
08:12:57.830 --> 08:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the county attorneys of new hampshire
 
08:12:57.840 --> 08:12:59.430 align:start position:0%
the county attorneys of new hampshire
say

08:12:59.430 --> 08:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
08:12:59.440 --> 08:13:00.230 align:start position:0%

08:13:06.788 --> 08:13:06.798 align:start position:0%

08:13:09.590 --> 08:13:09.600 align:start position:0%

many
 
08:13:14.708 --> 08:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcement departments do not have
 
08:13:18.628 --> 08:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
the equipment or the capacity to store
 
08:13:20.230 --> 08:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you

i make that motion and the

representative board now you wish to
 
08:18:36.788 --> 08:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:38.708 --> 08:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak to the
 
08:18:38.718 --> 08:18:40.308 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak to the
question

08:18:40.308 --> 08:18:40.318 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:18:42.308 --> 08:18:42.318 align:start position:0%
oh wait can i
 
08:18:44.548 --> 08:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
i still think that issue about what uh
 
08:18:48.230 --> 08:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know the when when when somebody
 
08:18:50.868 --> 08:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to uh agree i still think
 
08:18:52.230 --> 08:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed but but that's
 
08:18:54.628 --> 08:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
not a reason not to i intend to vote yes
 
08:18:56.070 --> 08:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
that can be either changed by a floor
 
08:18:58.948 --> 08:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
amendment or changed in the senate
 
08:19:01.590 --> 08:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think it it's a reason not to
 
08:19:03.750 --> 08:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
proceed so i intend to vote yes
 
08:19:05.590 --> 08:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
if anyone wishes to me
 
08:19:07.830 --> 08:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
although i don't mean to rush this the
 
08:19:09.430 --> 08:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is we
 
08:19:11.590 --> 08:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're not here tomorrow to execute so we
 
08:19:13.910 --> 08:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's today or never so a four amendment
 
08:19:15.270 --> 08:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
to address that representative and i
 
08:19:16.548 --> 08:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
would have no
 
08:19:17.910 --> 08:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
problem putting the best whatever we
 
08:19:19.350 --> 08:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
send to the other side assuming it
 
08:19:21.350 --> 08:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
passes the house we should send them the
 
08:19:21.360 --> 08:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
passes the house we should send them the
best

08:19:25.670 --> 08:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:27.270 --> 08:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
if it's possible maybe representative
 
08:19:28.308 --> 08:19:28.318 align:start position:0%
welch and
 
08:19:29.910 --> 08:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative you guys can continue
 
08:19:32.230 --> 08:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
that healthy conversation if i could
 
08:19:33.430 --> 08:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
just for a second
 
08:19:36.468 --> 08:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
um you don't feel that the fact that
 
08:19:38.150 --> 08:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
this would mandate recording of an
 
08:19:40.230 --> 08:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
interrogation so that would recording
 
08:19:42.628 --> 08:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
would be press start hello my name is
 
08:19:44.150 --> 08:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
officer so-and-so
 
08:19:46.708 --> 08:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
we're here today to interview you you're
 
08:19:48.070 --> 08:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
being already recorded i don't want to
 
08:19:51.990 --> 08:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
be recorded who stops he's captured
 
08:19:53.670 --> 08:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
would that
 
08:19:56.070 --> 08:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know i think i mean i i think often
 
08:19:57.590 --> 08:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
it would happen that way but i could see
 
08:19:59.990 --> 08:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes where the police officer might
 
08:20:01.510 --> 08:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
say to the purge you know to the person
 
08:20:02.868 --> 08:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
as they are sort of taking him into the
 
08:20:04.388 --> 08:20:04.398 align:start position:0%
interrogation room listen we're going to
 
08:20:05.910 --> 08:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
have to you know we're going to we're
 
08:20:06.868 --> 08:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
going to have a conversation we're going
 
08:20:09.350 --> 08:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
to have to record this and he says no
 
08:20:11.190 --> 08:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know before they even get in there
 
08:20:13.270 --> 08:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of situation where i
 
08:20:15.030 --> 08:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
think it could come up but you know as i
 
08:20:16.230 --> 08:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
say it's not
 
08:20:17.830 --> 08:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a big deal i don't think
 
08:20:22.388 --> 08:20:22.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:24.548 --> 08:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
08:20:27.110 --> 08:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
i just even have a problem with this in
 
08:20:28.468 --> 08:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
08:20:28.478 --> 08:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
the sense that
if

08:20:29.270 --> 08:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
08:20:31.190 --> 08:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i can give a couple of exa at least
 
08:20:34.070 --> 08:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
one example but my problem is if
 
08:20:35.990 --> 08:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
somebody was trying to arrest me or
 
08:20:39.270 --> 08:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
gonna take me to this police station the
 
08:20:42.628 --> 08:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
the only words out of my mouth would be
 
08:20:44.548 --> 08:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
i want my lawyer
 
08:20:47.510 --> 08:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then i would stop talking
 
08:20:50.150 --> 08:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
period and i can give you an example of
 
08:20:52.788 --> 08:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
how i feel and yet i think the police do
 
08:20:55.590 --> 08:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
an exact job i wouldn't want their job i
 
08:20:56.788 --> 08:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
commend them
 
08:20:59.430 --> 08:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
but i had police come to my door and i
 
08:21:01.750 --> 08:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
live in an apartment complex buzzed them
 
08:21:04.230 --> 08:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
up they got to my door they said can we
 
08:21:05.110 --> 08:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
come in
 
08:21:07.110 --> 08:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
do you know what my first words to them
 
08:21:07.120 --> 08:21:08.468 align:start position:0%
do you know what my first words to them
were

08:21:08.468 --> 08:21:08.478 align:start position:0%
were
 
08:21:10.548 --> 08:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
no you may not
 
08:21:12.708 --> 08:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
and then we talked a little bit and then
 
08:21:14.708 --> 08:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
they did come in based on what they said
 
08:21:17.830 --> 08:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
to me but i at that point still knew
 
08:21:19.670 --> 08:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
that if they saw something and i don't
 
08:21:21.510 --> 08:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
have anything i don't do marijuana i
 
08:21:23.830 --> 08:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't have wheat i don't have any
 
08:21:26.308 --> 08:21:26.318 align:start position:0%
but that when you allow the police into
 
08:21:27.670 --> 08:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
your house
 
08:21:29.830 --> 08:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
and they see something that they know is
 
08:21:32.230 --> 08:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
not kosher
 
08:21:35.110 --> 08:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
bam you are in trouble it's in the
 
08:21:37.110 --> 08:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
evidence it's you're out in the open
 
08:21:38.468 --> 08:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
they're not searching your drawers
 
08:21:41.030 --> 08:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're just and that's why i say
 
08:21:42.548 --> 08:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
you got to use your head when it comes
 
08:21:43.830 --> 08:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to the police
 
08:21:45.910 --> 08:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
i want my lawyer
 
08:21:49.430 --> 08:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
so again i can't abide by this i i know
 
08:21:51.750 --> 08:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
where you're trying to go i love david
 
08:21:54.468 --> 08:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
welsh representative welch and not in
 
08:21:54.478 --> 08:21:55.350 align:start position:0%
welsh representative welch and not in
that

08:21:55.350 --> 08:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:21:59.510 --> 08:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
off color way but i respect him i
 
08:22:02.150 --> 08:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
respect what he's trying to do and yet i
 
08:22:05.270 --> 08:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
also respect representative true and i

going to come back and bite you in the
 
08:22:09.520 --> 08:22:10.388 align:start position:0%
going to come back and bite you in the

thank you i appreciate the time mr
chairman

08:22:13.750 --> 08:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
08:22:16.070 --> 08:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:22:18.788 --> 08:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i just really quick i
 
08:22:20.628 --> 08:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we we all as
 
08:22:24.230 --> 08:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
a committee um understand and appreciate
 
08:22:26.468 --> 08:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
the fact that law enforcement does what
 
08:22:29.030 --> 08:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
we pay them with our tax dollars to do
 
08:22:31.510 --> 08:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
and that is to catch criminals and
 
08:22:33.350 --> 08:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes um it doesn't work
 
08:22:34.708 --> 08:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
out right but
 
08:22:36.708 --> 08:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
um besmirching all the law enforcement
 
08:22:37.910 --> 08:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
is you know we've got to watch out there
 
08:22:40.788 --> 08:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
out to get us is also not the way to go
 
08:22:42.388 --> 08:22:42.398 align:start position:0%
um they're doing what we pay them to do
 
08:22:44.548 --> 08:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
and at that great personal risk to
 
08:22:46.628 --> 08:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
themselves oftentimes so
 
08:22:49.110 --> 08:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're missing one point
 
08:22:51.350 --> 08:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
we make the laws that they have to
 
08:22:52.708 --> 08:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
enforce that's correct in this
 
08:22:52.718 --> 08:22:55.430 align:start position:0%
enforce that's correct in this

yes uh this amendment that came forward
 
08:26:40.478 --> 08:26:41.350 align:start position:0%
yes uh this amendment that came forward
is

08:26:41.350 --> 08:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:26:42.788 --> 08:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
is well written
 
08:26:44.948 --> 08:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
it goes right to the point
 
08:26:44.958 --> 08:26:46.788 align:start position:0%
it goes right to the point
um

08:26:46.788 --> 08:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:26:49.910 --> 08:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know i believe even the ag is uh in
 
08:26:51.430 --> 08:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
support of it
 
08:26:53.670 --> 08:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
or they're not going to oppose it
 
08:26:55.910 --> 08:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
because i don't think they support much
 
08:26:57.830 --> 08:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
they want to stay as much as neutral as
 
08:26:59.190 --> 08:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
they can i guess
 
08:27:02.548 --> 08:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just a good amendment
 
08:27:04.628 --> 08:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
and so the overall bill with the
 
08:27:07.430 --> 08:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
amendment will be a perfect bill to send
 
08:27:09.670 --> 08:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
to the other body which they should be
 
08:27:13.270 --> 08:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:17.990 --> 08:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:19.750 --> 08:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative lin yeah i just want to
 
08:27:22.230 --> 08:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
second what uh representative uh burt
 
08:27:25.910 --> 08:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
said this um this really was a a
 
08:27:28.150 --> 08:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
a collaborative effort of i think a
 
08:27:31.110 --> 08:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
number of interest uh groups
 
08:27:33.190 --> 08:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and as representative burt said the
 
08:27:35.670 --> 08:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
the uh we did run this by attorney
 
08:27:37.670 --> 08:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
general formella he indicated he had no
 
08:27:39.750 --> 08:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
problem with it i think you're probably
 
08:27:42.468 --> 08:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
right that he may not come over and say
 
08:27:44.230 --> 08:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know he affirmatively supports it
 
08:27:46.230 --> 08:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
but that that's just because they don't
 
08:27:47.590 --> 08:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
generally want to take a position on
 
08:27:49.350 --> 08:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
policy things that they think for the
 
08:27:52.070 --> 08:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislature but um
 
08:27:54.308 --> 08:27:54.318 align:start position:0%
it's a very i think it's a good proposal
 
08:27:56.150 --> 08:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
i note that um
 
08:27:56.160 --> 08:27:57.910 align:start position:0%
i note that um
uh

08:27:57.910 --> 08:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:27:59.750 --> 08:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of the person one people i suspect
 
08:28:02.308 --> 08:28:02.318 align:start position:0%
that the that this committee has heard
 
08:28:04.308 --> 08:28:04.318 align:start position:0%
from previously was
 
08:28:07.110 --> 08:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
alan rice from the gun owners of america
 
08:28:09.110 --> 08:28:09.120 align:start position:0%

08:28:33.270 --> 08:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
that organization's council and frankly
 
08:28:34.468 --> 08:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
that was something that none of us had
 
08:28:36.070 --> 08:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
thought about and it was it's a very
 
08:28:37.590 --> 08:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
good point
 
08:28:40.388 --> 08:28:40.398 align:start position:0%
uh because there is there is this uh
 
08:28:42.948 --> 08:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
federal statute you know when you have
 
08:28:45.270 --> 08:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
the instant the uh instant background
 
08:28:45.280 --> 08:28:46.388 align:start position:0%
the instant the uh instant background
checks

08:28:46.388 --> 08:28:46.398 align:start position:0%
checks
 
08:28:48.070 --> 08:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a provision in the federal
 
08:28:49.750 --> 08:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
statute that says the records of that
 
08:28:52.150 --> 08:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
have to be destroyed except for that
 
08:28:53.430 --> 08:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
by the federal government they have to
 
08:28:55.350 --> 08:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
be destroyed except for that
 
08:28:57.670 --> 08:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh unique number and so this would
 
08:28:57.680 --> 08:28:58.628 align:start position:0%
uh unique number and so this would
prevent

08:28:58.628 --> 08:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
08:29:00.948 --> 08:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
any any distribution of that kind of
 
08:29:02.788 --> 08:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
information so i i think it i agree with
 
08:29:04.468 --> 08:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
representative burt i think it's a i
 
08:29:09.590 --> 08:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:29:11.990 --> 08:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
08:29:13.830 --> 08:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm going to
 
08:29:16.388 --> 08:29:16.398 align:start position:0%
speak slowly because if we're here after
 
08:29:22.708 --> 08:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:29:25.350 --> 08:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
is somebody going to
 
08:29:27.990 --> 08:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
i hear that the amendment is a very good
 
08:29:28.000 --> 08:29:29.670 align:start position:0%
i hear that the amendment is a very good
amendment

08:29:29.670 --> 08:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:29:30.948 --> 08:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
is somebody
 
08:29:32.628 --> 08:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the amendment
 
08:29:34.788 --> 08:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
amendment than i am
 
08:29:37.030 --> 08:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to explain the changes
 
08:29:41.590 --> 08:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:29:43.990 --> 08:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative true so
 
08:29:47.030 --> 08:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
08:29:48.308 --> 08:29:48.318 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm looking at the amendment if
 
08:29:50.948 --> 08:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
you look at lines 9
 
08:29:54.388 --> 08:29:54.398 align:start position:0%
to 18. that is in the original bill that
 
08:29:56.308 --> 08:29:56.318 align:start position:0%
is unchanged
 
08:29:58.070 --> 08:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at
 
08:29:59.430 --> 08:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
page two
 
08:30:02.468 --> 08:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
lines four to seven
 
08:30:04.308 --> 08:30:04.318 align:start position:0%
that's the severability clause that is
 
08:30:05.670 --> 08:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
also in the original bill my
 
08:30:07.190 --> 08:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
understanding those provisions word for
 
08:30:08.948 --> 08:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
word have not changed
 
08:30:11.350 --> 08:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
and last year
 
08:30:12.788 --> 08:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
we the house
 
08:30:14.708 --> 08:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
had a similar bill
 
08:30:15.990 --> 08:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
and we passed an amendment in this
 
08:30:19.030 --> 08:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee that was identical to
 
08:30:24.708 --> 08:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:26.230 --> 08:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
the first section which starts on line
 
08:30:27.270 --> 08:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
nine that's
 
08:30:30.628 --> 08:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
what is being added in the amendment is
 
08:30:30.638 --> 08:30:31.670 align:start position:0%
what is being added in the amendment is
lines

08:30:31.670 --> 08:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
lines
 
08:30:31.680 --> 08:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
lines
19

08:30:33.430 --> 08:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
19
 
08:30:36.070 --> 08:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
to 29 on page one
 
08:30:38.708 --> 08:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
and then on page two lines one
 
08:30:41.510 --> 08:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:43.350 --> 08:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what the changes and my
 
08:30:45.430 --> 08:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of it's a clarification
 
08:30:47.030 --> 08:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
08:30:49.270 --> 08:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
simply a policy issue relating to the
 
08:30:51.270 --> 08:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
regulation enforcement of
 
08:30:54.948 --> 08:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh firearms uh if someone is involved in
 
08:30:54.958 --> 08:30:56.150 align:start position:0%
uh firearms uh if someone is involved in
trafficking

08:30:56.150 --> 08:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
08:30:56.160 --> 08:30:57.670 align:start position:0%
trafficking
narcotics

08:30:57.670 --> 08:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
narcotics
 
08:30:57.680 --> 08:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
narcotics
at

08:30:59.430 --> 08:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
08:30:59.440 --> 08:31:00.150 align:start position:0%
at
the

08:31:00.150 --> 08:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:31:02.548 --> 08:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
state or county or municipal
 
08:31:04.070 --> 08:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
police office could assist
 
08:31:06.150 --> 08:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
in enforcing the federal drug laws if
 
08:31:08.708 --> 08:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
they so choose so
 
08:31:08.718 --> 08:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
they so choose so
but

08:31:09.510 --> 08:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:31:11.990 --> 08:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
not strictly just to enforce firearms
 
08:31:13.350 --> 08:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's that what this would do there
 
08:31:14.548 --> 08:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
have to be something in addition to that
 
08:31:17.030 --> 08:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
but you cannot use it as a shield per se
 
08:31:17.040 --> 08:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
but you cannot use it as a shield per se
from

08:31:25.750 --> 08:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:27.590 --> 08:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is the exact language we
 
08:31:27.600 --> 08:31:28.628 align:start position:0%
this is this is the exact language we
passed

08:31:28.628 --> 08:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
passed
 
08:31:28.638 --> 08:31:29.670 align:start position:0%
passed
last

08:31:29.670 --> 08:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
08:31:31.190 --> 08:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
last year um
 
08:31:32.548 --> 08:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what that second
 
08:31:33.830 --> 08:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph does
 
08:31:39.270 --> 08:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:41.030 --> 08:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
08:31:42.308 --> 08:31:42.318 align:start position:0%
is there anywhere in here that is a
 
08:31:42.318 --> 08:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
is there anywhere in here that is a
penalty

08:31:44.070 --> 08:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
08:31:46.788 --> 08:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
for non-compliance
 
08:31:49.430 --> 08:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
there is no express penalty however the
 
08:31:51.430 --> 08:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
um there was a bill we recently passed
 
08:31:52.548 --> 08:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
this committee now we haven't passed in
 
08:31:55.590 --> 08:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
the house yet but it did pass on consent
 
08:31:57.510 --> 08:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
it had to do with the
 
08:31:59.590 --> 08:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
account police accountability and police
 
08:32:01.670 --> 08:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
standards where we expanded the members
 
08:32:01.680 --> 08:32:02.468 align:start position:0%
standards where we expanded the members
of

08:32:02.468 --> 08:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
08:32:05.110 --> 08:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the of the committee on that
 
08:32:08.150 --> 08:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
in that bill there is a provision that
 
08:32:09.670 --> 08:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
basically if a law enforcement officer
 
08:32:13.990 --> 08:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
willfully disregards their duty
 
08:32:15.670 --> 08:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is basically restricting
 
08:32:17.670 --> 08:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
what police officers can do okay
 
08:32:19.190 --> 08:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
if they would they would be subject to
 
08:32:20.788 --> 08:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
that disciplinary board it's my
 
08:32:22.388 --> 08:32:22.398 align:start position:0%
understanding but there's no
 
08:32:23.830 --> 08:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
some states have passed provisioning
 
08:32:26.150 --> 08:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
this they have
 
08:32:28.308 --> 08:32:28.318 align:start position:0%
different types of enforcement penalties
 
08:32:30.230 --> 08:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
enforced by the attorney general
 
08:32:32.070 --> 08:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
this does not have that okay it looks
 
08:32:35.670 --> 08:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:37.190 --> 08:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative connolly
 
08:32:39.510 --> 08:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
08:32:41.110 --> 08:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure how i'm going to vote
 
08:32:42.628 --> 08:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
on this right now
 
08:32:45.750 --> 08:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's not because i've changed my mind on
 
08:32:45.760 --> 08:32:47.110 align:start position:0%
it's not because i've changed my mind on
firearms

08:32:47.110 --> 08:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
08:32:49.510 --> 08:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
but i do think one should be consistent
 
08:32:51.430 --> 08:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
in one's views if i don't want the
 
08:32:53.190 --> 08:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
federal government enforcing cannabis
 
08:32:54.708 --> 08:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
laws in our state if i don't want the
 
08:32:57.590 --> 08:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal government enforcing immigration
 
08:32:59.270 --> 08:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
laws in our state
 
08:33:01.990 --> 08:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
would i then not be consistent and
 
08:33:06.628 --> 08:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:08.070 --> 08:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering if somebody could
 
08:33:09.990 --> 08:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
address whether or not the grants are at
 
08:33:13.110 --> 08:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
risk we heard about that earlier
 
08:33:14.708 --> 08:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
during testimony
 
08:33:14.718 --> 08:33:16.948 align:start position:0%
during testimony
but

08:33:16.948 --> 08:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:33:20.150 --> 08:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:21.910 --> 08:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's just where i am at it uh with
 
08:33:21.920 --> 08:33:23.270 align:start position:0%
that's just where i am at it uh with
this

08:33:23.270 --> 08:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
08:33:23.280 --> 08:33:24.230 align:start position:0%
this
i

08:33:24.230 --> 08:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
08:33:25.670 --> 08:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
i will say
 
08:33:29.030 --> 08:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh hp 1598 which is the bill we passed
 
08:33:30.868 --> 08:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
17 to 4 in the committee had
 
08:33:32.788 --> 08:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
some language not identical but similar
 
08:33:35.270 --> 08:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
where would prevent police
 
08:33:36.628 --> 08:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement officers from
 
08:33:38.628 --> 08:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
participating and enforcing
 
08:33:40.150 --> 08:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis laws with the federal
 
08:33:42.230 --> 08:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
government so we have passed this policy
 
08:33:44.150 --> 08:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
before in other subjects
 
08:33:46.230 --> 08:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
in regards to the grants i asked i asked
 
08:33:47.990 --> 08:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
that question during the public hearing
 
08:33:49.510 --> 08:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
if there was any
 
08:33:52.308 --> 08:33:52.318 align:start position:0%
examples where they could say any state
 
08:33:54.788 --> 08:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
was denied a grant or denied funding
 
08:33:56.628 --> 08:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
because of this policy
 
08:33:56.638 --> 08:33:57.430 align:start position:0%
because of this policy
and

08:33:57.430 --> 08:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:34:02.830 --> 08:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:06.230 --> 08:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
so again a quick follow-up so i think it
 
08:34:07.990 --> 08:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
was alan rice with whom i don't
 
08:34:10.628 --> 08:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
generally agree on much of anything said
 
08:34:10.638 --> 08:34:12.070 align:start position:0%
generally agree on much of anything said
federal

08:34:12.070 --> 08:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
federal
 
08:34:14.628 --> 08:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
officials enforce federal laws
 
08:34:17.270 --> 08:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
state officials enforce state laws
 
08:34:17.280 --> 08:34:19.510 align:start position:0%
state officials enforce state laws
and

08:34:19.510 --> 08:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:34:21.910 --> 08:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to to find a flaw with that
 
08:34:23.990 --> 08:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
argument although i would hope that
 
08:34:26.150 --> 08:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
other members take a similarly holistic
 
08:34:27.990 --> 08:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
approach when we have other bills before
 
08:34:30.868 --> 08:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
this body that have a similar question
 
08:34:38.788 --> 08:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:40.788 --> 08:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative pantalaquis yes can
 
08:34:43.990 --> 08:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
somebody give me a reason for this bill
 
08:34:47.430 --> 08:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it says a presidential executive
 
08:34:51.990 --> 08:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:55.670 --> 08:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:58.308 --> 08:34:58.318 align:start position:0%
never come down to new hampshire well
 
08:34:59.830 --> 08:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
i can i can answer your question in
 
08:35:01.350 --> 08:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
respect whether there isn't is not an
 
08:35:03.510 --> 08:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
executive order those can be those can
 
08:35:05.350 --> 08:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
happen at any time
 
08:35:05.360 --> 08:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
happen at any time
and

08:35:07.030 --> 08:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:35:08.308 --> 08:35:08.318 align:start position:0%
i i would just be straight pretty
 
08:35:09.350 --> 08:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward i'm pretty sure the
 
08:35:11.270 --> 08:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
current president has said if
 
08:35:13.110 --> 08:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't done that he
 
08:35:14.708 --> 08:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
it would be done through executive order
 
08:35:16.230 --> 08:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
that has not happened
 
08:35:18.788 --> 08:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
but during the campaigning process
 
08:35:21.670 --> 08:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
that was said several times over
 
08:35:24.388 --> 08:35:24.398 align:start position:0%
but what about any fun any money that's
 
08:35:25.590 --> 08:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
08:35:26.868 --> 08:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we might
 
08:35:29.190 --> 08:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
be deterred by this
 
08:35:31.030 --> 08:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
i i heard that concern i asked
 
08:35:33.430 --> 08:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
specifically what grants are there any
 
08:35:34.948 --> 08:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
grants that they were specifically
 
08:35:36.308 --> 08:35:36.318 align:start position:0%
worried about that the state of new
 
08:35:37.990 --> 08:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire wouldn't get or there any
 
08:35:39.910 --> 08:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
situation where other states were denied
 
08:35:41.110 --> 08:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
grants or
 
08:35:43.830 --> 08:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
lost funding as a result of any policy
 
08:35:45.190 --> 08:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
08:35:46.948 --> 08:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
and not a single example could have been
 
08:35:46.958 --> 08:35:48.468 align:start position:0%
and not a single example could have been
provided

08:35:48.468 --> 08:35:48.478 align:start position:0%
provided
 
08:35:50.150 --> 08:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're not the first state to
 
08:35:50.160 --> 08:35:51.190 align:start position:0%
we're not the first state to
uh

08:35:51.190 --> 08:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:35:54.868 --> 08:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
to entertain a policy like this so
 
08:35:56.868 --> 08:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
in since last year
 
08:35:58.468 --> 08:35:58.478 align:start position:0%
i think two additional i think texas and
 
08:36:00.948 --> 08:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
missouri also have now passed a
 
08:36:02.548 --> 08:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
not the exact same bill but a similar
 
08:36:02.558 --> 08:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
not the exact same bill but a similar
policy

08:36:03.750 --> 08:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
policy
 
08:36:05.990 --> 08:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
hey thank you
 
08:36:08.230 --> 08:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative bradley
 
08:36:10.468 --> 08:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
yes i just have a question so if this so
 
08:36:11.910 --> 08:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
if there's an executive order by the
 
08:36:14.868 --> 08:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
president and he decided to say
 
08:36:16.308 --> 08:36:16.318 align:start position:0%
you know we need background checks for
 
08:36:17.990 --> 08:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
all gun sales
 
08:36:20.230 --> 08:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
we here would not have to abide by that
 
08:36:21.430 --> 08:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
08:36:21.440 --> 08:36:22.708 align:start position:0%
is that correct
well

08:36:22.708 --> 08:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
well
 
08:36:24.230 --> 08:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's not that we wouldn't be abiding by
 
08:36:24.240 --> 08:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
it's not that we wouldn't be abiding by
it

08:36:25.030 --> 08:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:36:26.948 --> 08:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the local police
 
08:36:29.030 --> 08:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
officers whether state
 
08:36:31.910 --> 08:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
county municipal they would not be
 
08:36:34.708 --> 08:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
enforcing those laws that's a federal
 
08:36:36.150 --> 08:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
order it would be for the federal
 
08:36:39.750 --> 08:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
government to enforce that a firearms
 
08:36:42.150 --> 08:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
dealer is licensed by the feds and
 
08:36:44.788 --> 08:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
therefore if they do not follow
 
08:36:46.388 --> 08:36:46.398 align:start position:0%
the executive order
 
08:36:47.910 --> 08:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
i can imagine
 
08:36:49.270 --> 08:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
that they would have some licensing
 
08:36:50.468 --> 08:36:50.478 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
08:36:52.788 --> 08:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
unlike the cannabis laws the atf tends
 
08:36:54.628 --> 08:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
to actually enforce the federal law so
 
08:36:56.150 --> 08:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
they would
 
08:36:58.388 --> 08:36:58.398 align:start position:0%
there would be some issues there
 
08:37:00.708 --> 08:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
and they are already doing that based on
 
08:37:03.590 --> 08:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of eos on firearm accessories
 
08:37:03.600 --> 08:37:08.628 align:start position:0%
a couple of eos on firearm accessories
presently

08:37:08.628 --> 08:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:37:11.270 --> 08:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
you do appreciate the answer
 
08:37:15.030 --> 08:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative newman ray newman
 
08:37:18.150 --> 08:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i just have a question i mean
 
08:37:21.590 --> 08:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
right now the police local police
 
08:37:24.388 --> 08:37:24.398 align:start position:0%
cooperate with federal enforcement of
 
08:37:27.110 --> 08:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
firearm laws is that correct or not
 
08:37:28.468 --> 08:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
are there instances of that where they
 
08:37:31.670 --> 08:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
work together to enforce federal
 
08:37:34.308 --> 08:37:34.318 align:start position:0%
and if this passes would they be able to
 
08:37:38.388 --> 08:37:38.398 align:start position:0%
do to do that based upon this amendment
 
08:37:40.708 --> 08:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i'm not prepared to tell you
 
08:37:42.868 --> 08:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
specific examples but
 
08:37:45.510 --> 08:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
if this were to become law
 
08:37:47.430 --> 08:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
the police in new hampshire would not be
 
08:37:50.708 --> 08:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
able to simply to help and assist
 
08:37:52.868 --> 08:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
federal officers in forcing
 
08:37:56.308 --> 08:37:56.318 align:start position:0%
any federal firearm regulation
 
08:37:57.510 --> 08:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
if it's inconsistent with new
 
08:37:59.270 --> 08:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law
 
08:38:01.590 --> 08:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
so if our law is the same as the federal
 
08:38:03.270 --> 08:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
law we could still participate there
 
08:38:05.270 --> 08:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
would have to be some other criminal
 
08:38:05.280 --> 08:38:06.788 align:start position:0%
would have to be some other criminal
offense

08:38:06.788 --> 08:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
offense
 
08:38:09.270 --> 08:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the firearms in order for
 
08:38:11.270 --> 08:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the local law enforcement officers to be
 
08:38:16.150 --> 08:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:19.110 --> 08:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
so we we have we do not have a state law
 
08:38:21.030 --> 08:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
about firearms in schools is that
 
08:38:21.040 --> 08:38:22.868 align:start position:0%
about firearms in schools is that
correct

08:38:22.868 --> 08:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
correct
 
08:38:25.110 --> 08:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a state law that that does
 
08:38:27.670 --> 08:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
that the only state state law that i'm
 
08:38:28.628 --> 08:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
08:38:30.708 --> 08:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
there is there is no specific law that
 
08:38:32.468 --> 08:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
talks about members of the public there
 
08:38:34.548 --> 08:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
is a law prohibiting students
 
08:38:36.468 --> 08:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
08:38:39.270 --> 08:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
so so with adults
 
08:38:42.628 --> 08:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
there is no state law that prohibits
 
08:38:44.468 --> 08:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
an individual from carrying a firearm
 
08:38:45.590 --> 08:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
into a school
 
08:38:45.600 --> 08:38:46.548 align:start position:0%
into a school
right

08:38:46.548 --> 08:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
right
 
08:38:48.230 --> 08:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
right that's the under the current state
 
08:38:50.308 --> 08:38:50.318 align:start position:0%
law that's correct
 
08:38:52.548 --> 08:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
we had and we had that we had that bill
 
08:38:54.230 --> 08:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
last time we had this the bill on that
 
08:38:54.240 --> 08:38:55.350 align:start position:0%
last time we had this the bill on that
issue

08:38:55.350 --> 08:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
08:38:57.030 --> 08:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
so if there were a mass shooting or
 
08:38:58.628 --> 08:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
something that happened in a school or
 
08:39:01.510 --> 08:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
an individual need whatever
 
08:39:01.520 --> 08:39:02.308 align:start position:0%
an individual need whatever
the

08:39:02.308 --> 08:39:02.318 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:39:05.110 --> 08:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
if this amendment passes then the then
 
08:39:07.590 --> 08:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
the local officials and municipalities
 
08:39:09.270 --> 08:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
would not be able to assist them is that
 
08:39:11.910 --> 08:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
correct no because there's several
 
08:39:15.110 --> 08:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
capital level crimes that were committed
 
08:39:17.590 --> 08:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
murder shooting someone in a school for
 
08:39:20.150 --> 08:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
no reason is illegal and that's that's a
 
08:39:22.708 --> 08:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
felony it's felony it's a murder in the
 
08:39:24.070 --> 08:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
first degree
 
08:39:26.150 --> 08:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
so if that were to happen because there
 
08:39:27.030 --> 08:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
is a
 
08:39:28.948 --> 08:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
underlying offense that is against state
 
08:39:30.948 --> 08:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
law the murder first degree murder is
 
08:39:32.548 --> 08:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
illegal in new hampshire
 
08:39:32.558 --> 08:39:33.750 align:start position:0%
illegal in new hampshire
then

08:39:33.750 --> 08:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
08:39:35.190 --> 08:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
if the federal government asked us to
 
08:39:36.948 --> 08:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
help assist with that we would be
 
08:39:36.958 --> 08:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
help assist with that we would be
certainly

08:39:37.910 --> 08:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
08:39:39.190 --> 08:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
within our rights to do that the mere
 
08:39:40.388 --> 08:39:40.398 align:start position:0%
fact that someone's using a firearm
 
08:39:42.548 --> 08:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
illegally does not stop local
 
08:39:44.308 --> 08:39:44.318 align:start position:0%
uh police officers from enforcing other
 
08:39:46.468 --> 08:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
laws it's the mere fact of the gun
 
08:39:48.788 --> 08:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
regulation itself
 
08:39:50.548 --> 08:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
so for example if the federal government
 
08:39:52.708 --> 08:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
made it past a law
 
08:39:54.548 --> 08:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
restricting the capacity
 
08:39:57.030 --> 08:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
amount of rounds that a firearm can hold
 
08:39:59.110 --> 08:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
let's say they made it a 15 round max
 
08:40:01.030 --> 08:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
maximum the state of new hampshire would
 
08:40:05.830 --> 08:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:11.190 --> 08:40:11.200 align:start position:0%

i would say i will support the amendment
 
08:40:31.990 --> 08:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
but i am going to oppose the bill
 
08:40:34.830 --> 08:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment does improve uh the
 
08:40:38.230 --> 08:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill and i will support that amendment
 
08:40:40.308 --> 08:40:40.318 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:40:42.868 --> 08:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
represent representative roy
 
08:40:44.070 --> 08:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:40:46.230 --> 08:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna address my comments to my
 
08:40:49.590 --> 08:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues who would be inclined to um
 
08:40:52.150 --> 08:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
for a gut reaction to to vote against us
 
08:40:53.830 --> 08:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to try to change your
 
08:40:55.830 --> 08:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
mind i just want you to think about
 
08:40:58.150 --> 08:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
something if we went back in mr
 
08:41:00.388 --> 08:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
peabody's way back machine
 
08:41:01.990 --> 08:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
08:41:03.990 --> 08:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
and there were a different executive in
 
08:41:05.350 --> 08:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
the white house
 
08:41:08.150 --> 08:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
and he started issuing executive orders
 
08:41:10.948 --> 08:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
saying you know i prohibit this i
 
08:41:12.628 --> 08:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
prohibit that
 
08:41:14.308 --> 08:41:14.318 align:start position:0%
i feel like
 
08:41:15.750 --> 08:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
people would think differently so
 
08:41:16.948 --> 08:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
there's an important reason we have
 
08:41:19.030 --> 08:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
federalism because we like to do what we
 
08:41:21.430 --> 08:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
like to do locally and we don't want
 
08:41:23.670 --> 08:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
someone in washington telling us what to
 
08:41:25.910 --> 08:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
do and what not to do
 
08:41:28.070 --> 08:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
on a federal level so i just i throw
 
08:41:30.388 --> 08:41:30.398 align:start position:0%
that out as food for thought and i align
 
08:41:32.388 --> 08:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
myself with representative conley's
 
08:41:34.868 --> 08:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
thing you know we have to be consistent
 
08:41:37.750 --> 08:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
if if we don't um want them meddling in
 
08:41:38.868 --> 08:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
something then we don't want them
 
08:41:41.270 --> 08:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
meddling in anything
 
08:41:44.788 --> 08:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:46.868 --> 08:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
could i reply to that i don't
 
08:41:49.190 --> 08:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think the people that you
 
08:41:51.350 --> 08:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
address that comment to
 
08:41:51.360 --> 08:41:52.150 align:start position:0%
address that comment to
uh

08:41:52.150 --> 08:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:41:54.868 --> 08:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
pass laws based upon a gut feeling thank
 
08:41:56.948 --> 08:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
you i didn't address it to anyone
 
08:41:56.958 --> 08:41:59.190 align:start position:0%
you i didn't address it to anyone
specifically

08:41:59.190 --> 08:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
08:42:01.910 --> 08:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
represented pantologists yes i just feel
 
08:42:03.430 --> 08:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
08:42:05.830 --> 08:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
is not necessary and that our
 
08:42:08.788 --> 08:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
constituents out there that aren't gun
 
08:42:11.030 --> 08:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
crazy okay
 
08:42:13.030 --> 08:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't care about these things they want
 
08:42:16.070 --> 08:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
us to pass things that will protect them
 
08:42:18.230 --> 08:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
and take care of their
 
08:42:20.628 --> 08:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
thoughts and business and this every
 
08:42:23.030 --> 08:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
time we turn around and pass one of
 
08:42:25.830 --> 08:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
these gun things it comes out like we're
 
08:42:25.840 --> 08:42:27.190 align:start position:0%
these gun things it comes out like we're
all

08:42:27.190 --> 08:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
08:42:29.990 --> 08:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
in a world of our own out there
 
08:42:31.510 --> 08:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's just the way i feel my
 
08:42:34.150 --> 08:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
constituents call me and ask me if you
 
08:42:36.628 --> 08:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
have anything else to do in criminal
 
08:42:40.308 --> 08:42:40.318 align:start position:0%
justice besides past gun laws and i say
 
08:42:48.070 --> 08:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:51.990 --> 08:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:55.110 --> 08:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
one concern that i have is that
 
08:42:57.190 --> 08:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law doesn't mirror federal
 
08:42:58.948 --> 08:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
law when it comes to firearms
 
08:42:58.958 --> 08:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
law when it comes to firearms
trafficking

08:43:00.150 --> 08:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
08:43:03.110 --> 08:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:43:05.910 --> 08:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
an increasing problem with new hampshire
 
08:43:05.920 --> 08:43:07.110 align:start position:0%
an increasing problem with new hampshire
providing

08:43:07.110 --> 08:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
providing
 
08:43:09.750 --> 08:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a flow of guns into
 
08:43:12.628 --> 08:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
into other states
 
08:43:15.030 --> 08:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
by not even being able to cooperate with
 
08:43:17.830 --> 08:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
federal investigations
 
08:43:19.590 --> 08:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is
 
08:43:21.670 --> 08:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
the issue isn't guns falling into the
 
08:43:23.670 --> 08:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
hands of people
 
08:43:25.830 --> 08:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
who are legally able to own guns you
 
08:43:27.270 --> 08:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
know we're talking when we're talking
 
08:43:28.708 --> 08:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
about trafficking
 
08:43:31.430 --> 08:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
with guns falling into the hands of gang
 
08:43:33.590 --> 08:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
members felons
 
08:43:35.590 --> 08:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
and people who are prohibited by our own
 
08:43:35.600 --> 08:43:36.628 align:start position:0%
and people who are prohibited by our own
law

08:43:36.628 --> 08:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
law
 
08:43:39.430 --> 08:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
from actually from actually having guns
 
08:43:39.440 --> 08:43:40.868 align:start position:0%
from actually from actually having guns
um

08:43:40.868 --> 08:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:43:43.110 --> 08:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
i i see
 
08:43:46.788 --> 08:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
um i see that uh potential uh potential
 
08:43:52.788 --> 08:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:43:56.230 --> 08:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i i'm also uh you know
 
08:43:58.150 --> 08:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the wording uh which
 
08:44:00.788 --> 08:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
continues to talk about uh prohibiting
 
08:44:00.798 --> 08:44:02.388 align:start position:0%
continues to talk about uh prohibiting
cooperation

08:44:02.388 --> 08:44:02.398 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
08:44:02.398 --> 08:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
cooperation
um

08:44:03.190 --> 08:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:44:05.670 --> 08:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to to actually tell our
 
08:44:07.990 --> 08:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement folks you are not able
 
08:44:10.150 --> 08:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
to enforce this on your own
 
08:44:10.160 --> 08:44:11.110 align:start position:0%
to enforce this on your own
um

08:44:11.110 --> 08:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:44:13.510 --> 08:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's another thing for us to say
 
08:44:15.670 --> 08:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
you can't cooperate with an ongoing
 
08:44:17.750 --> 08:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
federal investigation into firearms
 
08:44:19.990 --> 08:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking which i think is what this
 
08:44:22.628 --> 08:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill would actually get into
 
08:44:25.590 --> 08:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and if i've if i'm misinterpreting
 
08:44:29.350 --> 08:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
this uh set me straight but
 
08:44:29.360 --> 08:44:30.628 align:start position:0%
this uh set me straight but
well

08:44:30.628 --> 08:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
08:44:31.670 --> 08:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
why don't
 
08:44:31.680 --> 08:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
why don't
just

08:44:33.510 --> 08:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
08:44:35.430 --> 08:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
08:44:36.788 --> 08:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
if anyone
 
08:44:39.190 --> 08:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
whether they're a criminal selling guns
 
08:44:39.200 --> 08:44:40.388 align:start position:0%
whether they're a criminal selling guns
illegally

08:44:40.388 --> 08:44:40.398 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
08:44:42.708 --> 08:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
a licensed firearm dealer or it's a
 
08:44:42.718 --> 08:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
a licensed firearm dealer or it's a
private

08:44:43.750 --> 08:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
08:44:45.830 --> 08:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
exchange between two people anyone who
 
08:44:48.948 --> 08:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
transfers a firearm to a person that is
 
08:44:50.868 --> 08:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
dis prohibited under law disqualified
 
08:44:53.190 --> 08:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
into law that is a crime
 
08:44:55.990 --> 08:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
in and of itself so if someone is
 
08:44:58.388 --> 08:44:58.398 align:start position:0%
giving is someone in new hampshire
 
08:45:00.548 --> 08:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
is transferring a firearm to someone
 
08:45:02.708 --> 08:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
who's a felon
 
08:45:04.948 --> 08:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is already against the law in new
 
08:45:04.958 --> 08:45:05.910 align:start position:0%
that is already against the law in new
hampshire

08:45:05.910 --> 08:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:45:08.230 --> 08:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
so this is not encouraging that activity
 
08:45:09.830 --> 08:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
nor would would
 
08:45:12.788 --> 08:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
would local officials be prohibited from
 
08:45:14.308 --> 08:45:14.318 align:start position:0%
assisting in that investigation because
 
08:45:16.308 --> 08:45:16.318 align:start position:0%
that person is committing a crime in
 
08:45:18.388 --> 08:45:18.398 align:start position:0%
violation of new hampshire law
 
08:45:20.708 --> 08:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
we we do spend a lot of time talking
 
08:45:23.030 --> 08:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
about enforceability in in this
 
08:45:24.628 --> 08:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
08:45:27.030 --> 08:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that we're
 
08:45:28.468 --> 08:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
you know would be doing would be
 
08:45:30.388 --> 08:45:30.398 align:start position:0%
essentially taking the teeth out of any
 
08:45:30.398 --> 08:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
essentially taking the teeth out of any
enforcement

08:45:31.510 --> 08:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
08:45:31.520 --> 08:45:32.868 align:start position:0%
enforcement
mechanism

08:45:32.868 --> 08:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
08:45:44.150 --> 08:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:45:46.070 --> 08:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
when was the last firearms trafficking
 
08:45:47.510 --> 08:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
case prosecuted in the state of new
 
08:45:50.628 --> 08:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire representative
 
08:45:52.468 --> 08:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
you're asking me when the last fight i
 
08:45:54.468 --> 08:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
do not know well you anecdotally said
 
08:45:55.590 --> 08:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem here in new
 
08:45:56.708 --> 08:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i'd like you to support
 
08:45:58.388 --> 08:45:58.398 align:start position:0%
your allegation with facts not
 
08:45:58.398 --> 08:46:00.230 align:start position:0%
your allegation with facts not
supposition

08:46:00.230 --> 08:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
supposition
 
08:46:00.240 --> 08:46:01.590 align:start position:0%
supposition
and

08:46:01.590 --> 08:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:46:03.190 --> 08:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
08:46:05.350 --> 08:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
your statement about
 
08:46:08.788 --> 08:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
people that's not supposed to have guns
 
08:46:11.350 --> 08:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have them they can't get them
 
08:46:13.430 --> 08:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd like to go and tell my two
 
08:46:13.440 --> 08:46:15.670 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd like to go and tell my two
grandchildren

08:46:15.670 --> 08:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
08:46:18.230 --> 08:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that that father who was chief of
 
08:46:21.030 --> 08:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
police of greenland a little town
 
08:46:23.510 --> 08:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
they buried him because someone that
 
08:46:25.990 --> 08:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't supposed to be have a firearm
 
08:46:27.350 --> 08:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
shot him
 
08:46:28.948 --> 08:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
so i mean that's
 
08:46:28.958 --> 08:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
so i mean that's
that

08:46:35.990 --> 08:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:38.230 --> 08:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and all all and i'll just clarify
 
08:46:40.230 --> 08:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
the comments i'm sorry for what if what
 
08:46:41.670 --> 08:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
happened with your family
 
08:46:41.680 --> 08:46:42.548 align:start position:0%
happened with your family
and

08:46:42.548 --> 08:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:46:44.708 --> 08:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is that if anyone were to
 
08:46:46.070 --> 08:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
transfer a firearm to someone who's not
 
08:46:48.150 --> 08:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to have one whether this bill
 
08:46:49.910 --> 08:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
passes or not that's still a crime out
 
08:46:51.830 --> 08:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire law and a crime under
 
08:46:56.070 --> 08:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
federal law so that that issue raised is
 
08:46:58.070 --> 08:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
not impacted by
 
08:47:01.110 --> 08:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh the house bill 1178 or the amendment
 
08:47:03.110 --> 08:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's already
 
08:47:04.548 --> 08:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
that should remain illegal because there
 
08:47:04.558 --> 08:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
that should remain illegal because there
is

08:47:05.750 --> 08:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:47:06.788 --> 08:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
there is
 
08:47:08.388 --> 08:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
certain disqualifications in place and
 
08:47:10.070 --> 08:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
that would even happen in a private
 
08:47:12.708 --> 08:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
situation if i were to simply gift a
 
08:47:14.230 --> 08:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
firearm to someone who i was just a
 
08:47:16.308 --> 08:47:16.318 align:start position:0%
friend of mine if that person's not
 
08:47:18.468 --> 08:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
allowed to possess one legally i would
 
08:47:20.230 --> 08:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
be committing a crime even if i didn't
 
08:47:22.070 --> 08:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
sell it so any type of traffic like that
 
08:47:23.590 --> 08:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
to felons would be
 
08:47:25.190 --> 08:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
already illegal and that's the point
 
08:47:27.910 --> 08:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
that i was trying to make
 
08:47:29.590 --> 08:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative can i just make a point
 
08:47:29.600 --> 08:47:30.388 align:start position:0%
representative can i just make a point
answer

08:47:30.388 --> 08:47:30.398 align:start position:0%
answer
 
08:47:32.388 --> 08:47:32.398 align:start position:0%
in response to the idea that like new
 
08:47:34.548 --> 08:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire because of its laxed quote
 
08:47:36.388 --> 08:47:36.398 align:start position:0%
unquote gun laws you know we are our
 
08:47:39.430 --> 08:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
supplier of guns to other places that's
 
08:47:41.350 --> 08:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
a frequently made argument around the
 
08:47:43.830 --> 08:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
country but stop but but and i submit
 
08:47:45.830 --> 08:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's really a fallacy stop and think
 
08:47:48.788 --> 08:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
about this if the theory is that new
 
08:47:51.670 --> 08:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire's gun laws are so lacks
 
08:47:54.468 --> 08:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
that we're causing the problem in let's
 
08:47:56.948 --> 08:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
say massachusetts or new york the guns
 
08:47:59.030 --> 08:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
are going down there well
 
08:48:00.948 --> 08:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
logically you would think if that was
 
08:48:03.270 --> 08:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
true if the guns were coming from new
 
08:48:03.280 --> 08:48:04.548 align:start position:0%
true if the guns were coming from new
hampshire

08:48:04.548 --> 08:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:48:07.190 --> 08:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
there would also be a real problem in
 
08:48:09.270 --> 08:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it wouldn't just be in
 
08:48:10.868 --> 08:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
these other states it would be there
 
08:48:13.830 --> 08:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
would be big crime a big crime problem
 
08:48:15.430 --> 08:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or the same thing is
 
08:48:17.190 --> 08:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
made the same argument is made in you
 
08:48:19.990 --> 08:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
know indiana indiana supplies all the
 
08:48:23.990 --> 08:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
guns for uh for chicago but you'd think
 
08:48:26.150 --> 08:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
that if that were true there would be a
 
08:48:27.830 --> 08:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
big because that the guns are
 
08:48:30.468 --> 08:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
originating in indiana there'd be a huge
 
08:48:32.868 --> 08:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
gun problem in indiana but in fact there
 
08:48:35.190 --> 08:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
isn't so that's i mean it's no
 
08:48:38.708 --> 08:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
disrespect to you representative do you
 
08:48:42.788 --> 08:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
remember that there was six guns found
 
08:48:45.350 --> 08:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts that were bought in
 
08:48:47.750 --> 08:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
08:48:50.868 --> 08:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
stores debt committee crimes
 
08:48:54.230 --> 08:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes six so this is the huge problem six
 
08:48:56.788 --> 08:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's huge to me
 
08:48:58.868 --> 08:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
just there is actually
 
08:49:00.308 --> 08:49:00.318 align:start position:0%
this information is actually published
 
08:49:03.910 --> 08:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:05.830 --> 08:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm well i know i only read the atf
 
08:49:07.750 --> 08:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
publication it's called
 
08:49:09.510 --> 08:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
time to crime and what it took into
 
08:49:11.750 --> 08:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
consideration was any firearms so it
 
08:49:13.430 --> 08:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
went state by state
 
08:49:16.308 --> 08:49:16.318 align:start position:0%
how much time would would go by between
 
08:49:19.350 --> 08:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
the time the firearm was sold to the to
 
08:49:20.628 --> 08:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
the point in time where a crime was
 
08:49:22.948 --> 08:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
committed with that firearm in in new
 
08:49:24.388 --> 08:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire the
 
08:49:25.750 --> 08:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
average time period was over eight and a
 
08:49:27.030 --> 08:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
half years
 
08:49:29.270 --> 08:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
between when the crime would occur with
 
08:49:30.788 --> 08:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
the use of that firearm now that's the
 
08:49:32.150 --> 08:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
atf public
 
08:49:34.388 --> 08:49:34.398 align:start position:0%
i didn't fact check that anything beyond
 
08:49:37.030 --> 08:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
reading the report and i don't have any
 
08:49:39.430 --> 08:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
problems with guns i own one
 
08:49:41.110 --> 08:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying
 
08:49:43.910 --> 08:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
that out there in the public eye
 
08:49:47.030 --> 08:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
they wonder what we do besides make laws
 
08:49:49.350 --> 08:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
about guns and if you don't think this
 
08:49:52.468 --> 08:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a newspaper issue it
 
08:49:54.308 --> 08:49:54.318 align:start position:0%
is and i mean
 
08:49:57.430 --> 08:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't i i'll do respect to you guys
 
08:50:00.548 --> 08:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
and what you think but that's my opinion
 
08:50:02.948 --> 08:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
i think that we ought to do something
 
08:50:05.590 --> 08:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
else besides past these things that's
 
08:50:05.600 --> 08:50:07.270 align:start position:0%
else besides past these things that's
all

08:50:07.270 --> 08:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
08:50:08.708 --> 08:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
08:50:12.070 --> 08:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um two things
 
08:50:14.308 --> 08:50:14.318 align:start position:0%
uh first on the trafficking piece i
 
08:50:16.628 --> 08:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
found an interesting quote uh from the
 
08:50:19.350 --> 08:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
giffords organization which okay throw
 
08:50:21.830 --> 08:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bias at it but uh new hampshire
 
08:50:24.868 --> 08:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
penalizes any person who
 
08:50:27.190 --> 08:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
in purchasing or otherwise securing
 
08:50:29.350 --> 08:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
delivery of a firearm gives false
 
08:50:32.230 --> 08:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
information or offers false evidence of
 
08:50:34.388 --> 08:50:34.398 align:start position:0%
his or her identity
 
08:50:37.350 --> 08:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has no other laws aimed at
 
08:50:39.590 --> 08:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
firearms trafficking
 
08:50:42.230 --> 08:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
and to circle back on that issue
 
08:50:44.230 --> 08:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
of course
 
08:50:48.150 --> 08:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
gun use is dramatically different in
 
08:50:50.628 --> 08:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
gary well maybe not gary indiana let's
 
08:50:52.548 --> 08:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
south bend indiana
 
08:50:55.910 --> 08:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus chicago this could be the same
 
08:50:55.920 --> 08:50:56.868 align:start position:0%
versus chicago this could be the same
here

08:50:56.868 --> 08:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
08:50:58.948 --> 08:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
08:51:01.670 --> 08:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
our culture in new hampshire is
 
08:51:05.510 --> 08:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
basically a neighborhood suburban and
 
08:51:05.520 --> 08:51:06.788 align:start position:0%
basically a neighborhood suburban and
rural

08:51:06.788 --> 08:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
rural
 
08:51:06.798 --> 08:51:08.230 align:start position:0%
rural
community

08:51:08.230 --> 08:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
08:51:10.548 --> 08:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
the way people use guns i'm from
 
08:51:14.628 --> 08:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
kentucky i'm i grew up my first 26 years
 
08:51:16.948 --> 08:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
of life minus college
 
08:51:19.350 --> 08:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
i spent in kentucky and there
 
08:51:20.708 --> 08:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
i we
 
08:51:24.230 --> 08:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
lived uh on meat that my family
 
08:51:27.350 --> 08:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh hunted as when times are tough for
 
08:51:30.548 --> 08:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
sure so i'm not against guns but it is
 
08:51:30.558 --> 08:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
sure so i'm not against guns but it is
definitely

08:51:31.830 --> 08:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
08:51:33.830 --> 08:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
a spurious claim i think that'd be the
 
08:51:36.868 --> 08:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
right way to put it to say
 
08:51:38.948 --> 08:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
how can there be trafficking of guns
 
08:51:40.708 --> 08:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
08:51:42.788 --> 08:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
to massachusetts that cause any problem
 
08:51:44.948 --> 08:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
because we'd have a problem here you
 
08:51:49.030 --> 08:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
cannot compare urban use of guns
 
08:51:49.040 --> 08:51:49.830 align:start position:0%
cannot compare urban use of guns
to

08:51:49.830 --> 08:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:51:52.628 --> 08:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
gun use in concord where i am a state
 
08:51:55.030 --> 08:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
rep the culture
 
08:51:55.040 --> 08:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
rep the culture
the

08:51:55.990 --> 08:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:51:57.670 --> 08:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
i mean do i really have to explain all
 
08:52:00.468 --> 08:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
the layers of the of culture i mean
 
08:52:03.350 --> 08:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
so much is different at an urban
 
08:52:05.670 --> 08:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
level versus here and i've lived in
 
08:52:08.308 --> 08:52:08.318 align:start position:0%
washington dc and louisville kentucky
 
08:52:10.388 --> 08:52:10.398 align:start position:0%
where there is an immense
 
08:52:12.948 --> 08:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
gun crimes guns are just used
 
08:52:12.958 --> 08:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
gun crimes guns are just used
differently

08:52:13.990 --> 08:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
differently
 
08:52:17.030 --> 08:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
so selling guns here because our laws
 
08:52:19.110 --> 08:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
are lacks
 
08:52:22.708 --> 08:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
goes to the greater boston area because
 
08:52:25.830 --> 08:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the way guns are used in trafficking
 
08:52:28.070 --> 08:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
drugs i don't know did i really have to
 
08:52:29.990 --> 08:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
spell that out i don't know but
 
08:52:30.000 --> 08:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
spell that out i don't know but
obviously

08:52:31.670 --> 08:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
08:52:33.670 --> 08:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
guns will still be here they're just
 
08:52:37.030 --> 08:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
used for hunting or self-protection or
 
08:52:37.040 --> 08:52:38.788 align:start position:0%
used for hunting or self-protection or
sometimes

08:52:38.788 --> 08:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
08:52:42.388 --> 08:52:42.398 align:start position:0%
use in a violent crime for sure but um
 
08:52:44.230 --> 08:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't dismiss it just
 
08:52:46.230 --> 08:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't look as ugly we also
 
08:52:50.070 --> 08:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
have far fewer people by by density of
 
08:52:52.230 --> 08:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
area than a lot of those places there's
 
08:52:54.468 --> 08:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
just so many layers of data i could
 
08:52:56.788 --> 08:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
provide just this is just top of
 
08:52:58.628 --> 08:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
08:53:01.030 --> 08:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's spurious to say therefore
 
08:53:03.910 --> 08:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have a gun problem
 
08:53:06.388 --> 08:53:06.398 align:start position:0%
we would have it just like boston
 
08:53:08.070 --> 08:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
i just hope that is helpful for you to
 
08:53:09.910 --> 08:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
think it through
 
08:53:13.110 --> 08:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
just a small point if if someone from
 
08:53:14.868 --> 08:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
massachusetts came to new hampshire to
 
08:53:16.548 --> 08:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
acquire a firearm
 
08:53:16.558 --> 08:53:17.590 align:start position:0%
acquire a firearm
the

08:53:17.590 --> 08:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:53:19.670 --> 08:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
dealer actually has to not only does
 
08:53:21.190 --> 08:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
that person have to be in compliance
 
08:53:23.030 --> 08:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire law they have to
 
08:53:25.750 --> 08:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
comply with massachusetts law so
 
08:53:27.110 --> 08:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law let's say they had a
 
08:53:29.350 --> 08:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
capacity restrict which they have some
 
08:53:31.350 --> 08:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
regulations on capacity restrictions
 
08:53:33.030 --> 08:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
when you if someone comes to the store
 
08:53:33.040 --> 08:53:33.910 align:start position:0%
when you if someone comes to the store
here

08:53:33.910 --> 08:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
08:53:36.308 --> 08:53:36.318 align:start position:0%
and they show their identification
 
08:53:38.308 --> 08:53:38.318 align:start position:0%
that the dealer is not going to make the
 
08:53:40.548 --> 08:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
transaction because it's not the new
 
08:53:45.910 --> 08:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:53:47.830 --> 08:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's that too but just right right
 
08:53:49.350 --> 08:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
off the bat that's
 
08:53:50.468 --> 08:53:50.478 align:start position:0%
saying that we're trapped we're
 
08:53:53.030 --> 08:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
supplying the surrounding states yes
 
08:53:55.190 --> 08:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not
 
08:53:57.990 --> 08:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
unless that person is is the sale is
 
08:53:59.750 --> 08:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
also complying with the other state's
 
08:53:59.760 --> 08:54:00.788 align:start position:0%
also complying with the other state's
law

08:54:00.788 --> 08:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
law
 
08:54:02.150 --> 08:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
the still the sale's not supposed to
 
08:54:03.910 --> 08:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
happen if it does happen that's that is
 
08:54:05.510 --> 08:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
an illegal sale
 
08:54:06.830 --> 08:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
from my understanding
 
08:54:10.308 --> 08:54:10.318 align:start position:0%
um grabs at gun shops lately they may be
 
08:54:12.788 --> 08:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
massachusetts perpetrators
 
08:54:15.270 --> 08:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
we know this from the law enforcement
 
08:54:17.750 --> 08:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
that gather in boston every year or so
 
08:54:20.070 --> 08:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
often i will admit i'm not an expert on
 
08:54:21.990 --> 08:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
this or i would have boned up on on this
 
08:54:24.628 --> 08:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
better but i do know this from
 
08:54:27.110 --> 08:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh sitting at the feet of representative
 
08:54:29.190 --> 08:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
catherine rogers who knows this issue
 
08:54:30.948 --> 08:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
well and has attended these meetings and
 
08:54:32.788 --> 08:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
she's been the only representative from
 
08:54:35.590 --> 08:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire at times and uh law
 
08:54:37.590 --> 08:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement official after law
 
08:54:39.510 --> 08:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials say the majority
 
08:54:41.590 --> 08:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the guns used in
 
08:54:41.600 --> 08:54:42.948 align:start position:0%
of the guns used in
crimes

08:54:42.948 --> 08:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
08:54:42.958 --> 08:54:44.948 align:start position:0%
crimes
probably

08:54:44.948 --> 08:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
probably
 
08:54:46.868 --> 08:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
well i can't say how they obtain them
 
08:54:48.468 --> 08:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you the guns are coming
 
08:54:49.830 --> 08:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
08:54:52.070 --> 08:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
as best they can determine at a much
 
08:54:54.948 --> 08:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
higher rate than happens in their state
 
08:54:54.958 --> 08:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
higher rate than happens in their state
so

08:54:55.910 --> 08:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:54:58.948 --> 08:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
that means our gun laws are conducive to
 
08:55:01.030 --> 08:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
giving guns to massachusetts but it
 
08:55:02.388 --> 08:55:02.398 align:start position:0%
sounds like you guys
 
08:55:04.468 --> 08:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
can make this
 
08:55:05.670 --> 08:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
can you just explain what law
 
08:55:07.350 --> 08:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency in massachusetts is
 
08:55:09.510 --> 08:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
blaming new hampshire for massachusetts
 
08:55:12.388 --> 08:55:12.398 align:start position:0%
uh i know that and i can look this up
 
08:55:15.190 --> 08:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i know that there were multiple
 
08:55:18.070 --> 08:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
i know the mayor of boston and the state
 
08:55:19.910 --> 08:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the state police and other
 
08:55:22.628 --> 08:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
agencies gathered together and invited
 
08:55:24.548 --> 08:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
people from new hampshire including
 
08:55:26.070 --> 08:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
representatives from the governor's
 
08:55:28.548 --> 08:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
office invited other places because of
 
08:55:31.350 --> 08:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
this guns and drugs we get the drugs we
 
08:55:33.590 --> 08:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
give them guns it's basically the way to
 
08:55:35.910 --> 08:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
water am i the only one that has heard
 
08:55:37.590 --> 08:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
of this i can't be
 
08:55:40.548 --> 08:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
this has probably been in testimony
 
08:55:42.388 --> 08:55:42.398 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to back me up here but
 
08:55:43.670 --> 08:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's definitely
 
08:55:45.750 --> 08:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think let me look let me look this up
 
08:55:49.430 --> 08:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:51.110 --> 08:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
come on amy representative green you're
 
08:55:51.120 --> 08:55:52.628 align:start position:0%
come on amy representative green you're
recognized

08:55:52.628 --> 08:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
08:55:54.868 --> 08:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
08:55:56.628 --> 08:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
speaking of gun trafficking one of the
 
08:55:59.110 --> 08:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
largest gun trafficking that was carried
 
08:56:01.350 --> 08:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
on was by the federal government and
 
08:56:03.430 --> 08:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
fast and furious
 
08:56:05.910 --> 08:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
where guns went to mexico and ended up
 
08:56:11.350 --> 08:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:56:13.350 --> 08:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative byrd you're recognized
 
08:56:15.830 --> 08:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and you know
 
08:56:17.670 --> 08:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
08:56:19.670 --> 08:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know i think we're getting way off
 
08:56:19.680 --> 08:56:21.670 align:start position:0%
you know i think we're getting way off
track

08:56:21.670 --> 08:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
track
 
08:56:24.468 --> 08:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
if anybody
 
08:56:26.150 --> 08:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
shoots somebody
 
08:56:28.548 --> 08:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
the local police is going to arrest them
 
08:56:31.350 --> 08:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to stop that
 
08:56:33.910 --> 08:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
if they wave a gun out the window
 
08:56:36.548 --> 08:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
driving down the road in a road rage the
 
08:56:38.548 --> 08:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
local police state police are going to
 
08:56:40.230 --> 08:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
pull that person over and they're going
 
08:56:42.708 --> 08:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
to arrest them it has nothing to do with
 
08:56:45.910 --> 08:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill only
 
08:56:49.830 --> 08:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
tells the feds or the local police that
 
08:56:53.350 --> 08:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
an executive order or other
 
08:56:58.388 --> 08:56:58.398 align:start position:0%
federal statutes if they limit magazine
 
08:56:58.398 --> 08:57:00.388 align:start position:0%
federal statutes if they limit magazine
capacity

08:57:00.388 --> 08:57:00.398 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
08:57:03.990 --> 08:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
or ban a certain type of gun
 
08:57:05.750 --> 08:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
it will tell them
 
08:57:08.708 --> 08:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
that local police will not enforce the
 
08:57:12.868 --> 08:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
federal mandate that's it
 
08:57:15.190 --> 08:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
now if i commit a crime with that
 
08:57:18.230 --> 08:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm being arrested by the local police
 
08:57:20.388 --> 08:57:20.398 align:start position:0%
you know this you know it just isn't you
 
08:57:22.628 --> 08:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
know we're way off topic here
 
08:57:25.510 --> 08:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you know so back to the bill
 
08:57:26.788 --> 08:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
08:57:28.388 --> 08:57:28.398 align:start position:0%
we're telling the local police they are
 
08:57:30.308 --> 08:57:30.318 align:start position:0%
not going to enforce the federal gun
 
08:57:33.030 --> 08:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
laws or or executive orders
 
08:57:35.190 --> 08:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
08:57:36.948 --> 08:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's the way it should be
 
08:57:38.948 --> 08:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
it's the separation we did it with
 
08:57:38.958 --> 08:57:40.468 align:start position:0%
it's the separation we did it with
marijuana

08:57:40.468 --> 08:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
08:57:41.430 --> 08:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
we are
 
08:57:42.468 --> 08:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
you know
 
08:57:44.708 --> 08:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know a free state here to do
 
08:57:47.990 --> 08:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana to appoint
 
08:57:51.190 --> 08:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
against federal wishes federal wishes
 
08:57:53.510 --> 08:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
say don't do that and we're not losing
 
08:57:55.750 --> 08:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
any federal money over it the feds
 
08:57:57.430 --> 08:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
aren't coming in here and arresting
 
08:58:00.230 --> 08:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
people over marijuana and
 
08:58:02.788 --> 08:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
yeah and and i just don't see why we're
 
08:58:05.430 --> 08:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
so far off topic of what this is
 
08:58:07.110 --> 08:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
intended to do
 
08:58:08.708 --> 08:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:58:10.388 --> 08:58:10.398 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
08:58:13.110 --> 08:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think at this time we can at least
 
08:58:15.190 --> 08:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
move the question whether to adopt the
 
08:58:16.868 --> 08:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
question is to whether to adopt
 
08:58:18.868 --> 08:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
amendment number two zero
