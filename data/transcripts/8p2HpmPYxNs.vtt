to hear is uh House Bill 1168
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law relative to soil
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners conditioners not
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners conditioners and I will
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
call on representative Bixby from
 
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
straford 17 to introduce the bill good
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
morning thank you um for the record I'm
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby representing straford 17
 
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby representing straford 17
from

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
Dober and uh the uh I first became aware
 
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
of the soil conditioner statute uh a
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
couple years ago when um a uh company I
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
order fertilizer from sometimes uh said
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
they couldn't ship to New Hampshire
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
anymore because because of uh the
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
because of the registration fees that
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
were particularly high in New Hampshire
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I looked into it a bit then and
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
then I didn't uh come up with a good I
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
didn't come up with a good solution at
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
that point uh and then I ran into it
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
again last year when uh at the last
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
moment uh some
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
lobbyists uh had uh convinced the Senate
 
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
to include a definition of um soil bio
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh see plant bio stimulants into the
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
soil Health Bill and uh they were
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
proposing to put it in a place in the
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
statutes that made no sense and uh
 
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl and I decided
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
figured out that the best place was
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere was in the uh the soil
 
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.790 align:start position:0%
somewhere was in the uh the soil
conditioner

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
conditioner
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and when we were doing that we
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
realized there were several issues uh um
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
several problems with the the statute um
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
so one of them is that the uh the title
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
of the statute soil conditioner is
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually not defined so uh we have a
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
statute on something that we have no
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
definition for what it actually is um
 
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.990 align:start position:0%
definition for what it actually is um
and

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh the another issue is that the
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
um the definitions don't take into
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
account requirements of the N uh n
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
National organic program even though the
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
state requires uh compliance for anyone
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
selling products labeled as organic so
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh organic fertilizer the it doesn't
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
have a definition of what would count as
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
an organic fertilizer even though uh the
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh laws indicate that uh such things
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
should be labeled
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and there are other there may be
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
other deviations from federal fertilizer
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
regulations or definitions that I was
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
unable to investigate in on uh at this
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
point and one of the reason Reas I'd
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
like a study committee is to to uh do
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
some further investigation on that uh
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
the definitions concerning compost and
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what counts as fertilizer are
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
also unclear under some definitions it
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
would seem that compost would be
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
considered a fertilizer under others it
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
would not um and the newly added
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
definition related to plant biotim
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
stimulants is somewhat unclear and it's
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
even less clear how it fits into the
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework in terms of um
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
how uh any uh of the standard nutrients
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
nitrogen potassium uh
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
phosphorus that happen to be in a plant
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
bio stimulant would be uh considered
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
either how where the where the line
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
between that being fertilizer and that
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
being uh just part of the plant bio
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
stimulant uh would be drawn
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so fertilizers and soil
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
conditioners clearly impact soil
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
properties and the scientific
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of how soils uh scientific
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of soils has grown
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
substantially since the chap chapter's
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
last significant revision which was in
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
the um I believe it was in the late uh
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s uh
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
so that's another issue that uh we need
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
to take a look at you know how does
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
current science uh affect the way that
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh these statutes are are um are
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
presented or or uh govern uh
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh another issue is that uh
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
is somewhat different from the the
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
details of definitions is that the
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
registration fees collected under this
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
chapter are sent to the general fund as
 
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
chapter are sent to the general fund as
unrestricted

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
income and Pen penalties also go to the
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
general fund there is no indication how
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
the work of analyzing fertilizer samples
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
verifying and approving
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
labels and taking enforcement action
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
gets paid
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
for when I was when I think well I think
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
that sending penalties to the general
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
fund makes sense because you don't want
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
to have the appearance that the body
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is uh doing the uh enforcement is
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
somehow profiting from enforcement
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
actions however I think that the uh
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
sending to the registration fees the
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
general fund is sort sort of like
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
converting a fee into a disproportionate
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
tax and I think that's something we need
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
to look at fairly
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
closely uh even if it's going been on
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
going been going on since uh about 1995
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
1996 I still don't think it's Justified
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so I think we need to take a careful
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
study of this chapter and make sure that
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
it continu continues to be aligned with
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
its purposes and that uh we correct any
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
outdated or misguided elements
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
so with that I conclude and I'm happy to
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you representative
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate this bill I I think it
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
encompasses a lot of the things that
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
this committee has looked at and run
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
into in the past and I appreciate you
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
putting it in are there any uh questions
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
Bixby seeing none I thank you again
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
apprciate the work you're
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
doing so that is the only pink card that
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
I have on this bill is there anyone else
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
1168 seeing none uh hola do we have a
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
that all right so we have a blank blue
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
sheet and the online signin sheet I'm
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to try and remember to read those
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
into the record as well I've finally
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
figured out how to access those so that
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
we can we can see what uh what we're
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
getting for input online there was also
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
no comments there all right with uh with
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%

49h must replace the entire bill and I
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%

leading up to that point but I emphasize
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
again the amendment distributed to all
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
of you must replace the entire original
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
Bill to provide some background on House
 
00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:53.589 align:start position:0%
Bill to provide some background on House
Bill

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
1547 it came from a brainstorm storming
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
session meeting uh last summer
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
consisting of community activists and
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
legislators from miramac to provide some
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
background which you may be familiar
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
with miramac has suffered the worst per
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
fluorochemical pollution in the state's
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
history caused by a private
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
polluter these pollutants have
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
infiltrated water air and soil
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
the bill was meant to monitor soil by
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
placing maximum levels of
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
contaminants but while in extensive
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
discussions with the New Hampshire
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services the
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
amendment is far more practical and
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable the amendment
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
0249 is in three
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
parts the the first part allows the
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Dees to initiate rules
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
for soil remediation standards per for
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
pero chemicals by November 1st
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
2023 this carefully chosen date is a
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
prime reason for the amendment replacing
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
Bill the United States Geological Survey
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
the US GS is performing a study in New
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of its soil due by the fall of
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
2022 and this study is
 
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
2022 and this study is
critical

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
critical to setting the soil standards
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thus the emphasis on the
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
amendment replacing the bill the bill
 
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.950 align:start position:0%
amendment replacing the bill the bill
rammed

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
rammed
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
through contaminant maximums and so
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
forth that cannot be right now because
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
this critical study is taking place now
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the information needed to determine
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
the levels of soil contaminants
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
Etc so in that section of the amendment
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're putting into law that deadline and
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
also a deadline for the commissioner of
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Dees to use that study in order to make
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
those determinations of the soil
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
contaminants very critical that this be
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
a well-thought out
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
process the second part of amendment 249
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
H amends the groundwater protection act
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
rul making section and I've placed the
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
statute for you there in your email
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
incidentally it's a link so it'll take
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
you right to it to add soil and that a
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
person which also includes companies and
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
public or private corporations per and
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
person is defined in another RSA which
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
I've provided for you here with a link
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
in your email that goes right to the
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
language make the person liable for such
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
contamination they must provide safe
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
alternative water to an impacted well
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.069 align:start position:0%
alternative water to an impacted well
owner

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
owner
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
again emphasizing that person which is
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing I saw which was language
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
suggested from the AG's office and
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
thinking what is that is it clearly
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
defined out to in to include
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
corporations and entities it turns out
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
in that statue it is and I can assure
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
you of
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
that the third part of the amendment 249
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
H which is sections 3 through 7
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive clarifies language
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
describing certification requirements
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
for certain hazardous waste
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
generators that was suggested in order
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
to avoid confusion that takes place and
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
maintain consistency when it comes to
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
the certain hazardous waste that
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
generators um take
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
in so those are the three sections
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
of the amendment intended to replace the
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
entire content of the original House
 
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.630 align:start position:0%
entire content of the original House
Bill

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
1547 in my
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
closing and I know um another
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative from miramac is here to
 
00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
representative from miramac is here to
provide

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
information um Dees is here to provide
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
information God bless you um in your
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
emails there should be
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh received from you a couple of letters
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I just want to end with this quote
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
this is from the SE Co students for
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
sustainability I met with them last
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
night they were interested in this bill
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
a group of uh teenagers and high school
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
students from around the state who make
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
up this organization interested in
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
issues facing the
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
environment representative rung and I
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
met with a student very impressive who
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
asked all the right questions about this
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill and was very
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
interested a few hours after our call
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
last night she wrote not one but two
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
very impressive letters endorsing this
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I just want to encl uh close
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
with this one paragraph because I think
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
it truly hits her having heard about
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and the amendment for the
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
first time but she truly captured it in
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
one paragraph
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
after our call last night and the
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph is as follows the
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the town of
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
miramac New Hampshire legislators and
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
highlights how all parties impacted were
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
considered in the crafting of this bill
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
it is holistic it is evidence-based and
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
it can help those who have been harmed
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
in her own words legislative director
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
for the SEO students for
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
sustainability uh this amendment was um
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
worked on for
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
months as she said all of the parties

uh will you take questions yes so I have
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
one myself actually two first one U
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's an acronym used on line 16 page
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
one AG gqs do you know what that stands
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
for it says
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
a pfas other than those for which the
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
currently the state currently has an AG
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
Qs I
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer if you if you give me I I yes I
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
do okay it stands for
 
00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
do okay it stands for
ambient

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
ambient
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standards okay thank
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
you wasn't quite sure what that meant I
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so so my other question
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
for you is so reading and listening to
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony it doesn't appear that
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
the state currently has any rules for
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
State uh for soil contamination by pfas
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
is is that accurate that's my
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
understanding okay thank you
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
representative era
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you so much
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and your bill this
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
question I'm interested to know um with
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh respect to lines 24 to
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
26 um a requirement that a person who is
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
liable for or has otherwise caused or
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
contributed to such contamination
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
provides safe alternative water to any
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
impacted well owner so how will it be
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
determined whether or not a person or
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
company or Corporation or whatever is
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
the cause of that contamination
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
because uh is there is there specific
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
way to determine that
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
and is that going to be addressed
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
somehow with this
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for the question
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
in the instance of miramac for example
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
um we have a a clear-cut
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
determination through courts and the
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
like that we have a private polluter in
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
town who has contaminated water not only
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
in our town but surrounding towns due to
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
Air and so forth uh that I'm sure would
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
be considered with regards to this
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
section as to determining a persons for
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
polluted follow up yep go
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
ahead okay but for purposes of perhap
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps other areas in the state where
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not as a clear-cut
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
determination is there a method that is
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
used by either D or any other agency to
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
make that determination I mean how is it
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
proved that uh somebody in particular or
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
a corporation in particular is the pluer
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah outside the courts you're saying as
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
in the case of miramac I I'm going to
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
let uh Dees take that okay thank you but
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Bixby yes thank
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um the the
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
obvious uh source of contamination in
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
this that that sort of initially drove
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is is probably the that
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
company in in marac but one uh other
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
place where soil and P contamination
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
issues sometimes comes up is in uh
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
places where um where uh biosolids or
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
sludge um septic sludge has been spread
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh on farms as a essentially is a sort
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
of like a compost replacement or
 
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:40.559 align:start position:0%
equivalent and it turns out later that
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
those uh that that sludge was
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
contaminated there was a case in arund
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
main uh few years a couple years back
 
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
where a Dairy Farmer basically lost his
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
entire operation because it became clear
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
that there that the uh buge that had
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
been spread was contaminated uh and that
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
it became clear it was not clear that uh
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
that was happening obviously when he was
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
doing it but uh that was the upshot and
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if this bill would have
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
any impact on the uh the S cases where
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh Sledge has been spread and in
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
contaminates agricultural
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
Fields thank you for that question I
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
would answer it
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
yes considering what you just described
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
may be uh classified as a person
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
considering how broad that definition is
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you Mr
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question and thank
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it sounds to
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
self-attestation program a self
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
attestation program okay um so my
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
question to you is at what point does an
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
entity know that they are to
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
then fill this self-certification
 
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
out uh I'm going to leave that to of of
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
person testifying after me that's very
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
specific I appreciate the question but
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
yeah any further
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
steton thank you for taking my question
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
two uh at uh line
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
four five certified hazardous waste
 
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.430 align:start position:0%
four five certified hazardous waste
coordinator

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
program and following it makes mention
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
the the term small quantity is removed
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
but the 220
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
pounds uh hazardous waste per month
 
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.430 align:start position:0%
pounds uh hazardous waste per month
stands

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
what what happens if they're producing
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste more than 220 pounds is
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
there another section of of law that
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
applies to those not contained
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
herein excellent question I'm going to
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
leave that also that is specific uh
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
beyond my knowledge of these working
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
statutes sections three through seven in
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the purpose I can tell you
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
of those sections though is to make it
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
consistent with terms that are used uh
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
when these statutes are being executed
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure there's an an answer for you
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
but it would be beyond my expert
 
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.069 align:start position:0%
but it would be beyond my expert
thank

00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
con there are forms generated by the
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
dees um for small quantity generators um
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
in manufacturing um that may produce
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
small amounts of hazardous waste how
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
will this affect
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
them I too I'm going to leave that that
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
is a very specific and Technical
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it certainly uh
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
but with the definitions being altered
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh to really the purpose of that section
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is to make the practice
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
of these existing statutes more
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
consistent so I know that these statutes
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
are being uh exercised all of the time
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
and uh with regards to that question
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
related to the exercise of those
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
specific statutes so I'll leave it to
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
someone who's more technically
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about it but thank you
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
questions any further
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you for
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you very much and
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
if you just give me a moment I'll wipe
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll uh call up uh
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative Rosemary rung from
 
00:50:10.599 --> 00:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
representative Rosemary rung from
Hillsboro

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
21 good morning representative welcome
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
to Ena good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um for hearing this
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
bill and for uh welcoming me to your
 
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.510 align:start position:0%
bill and for uh welcoming me to your
committee

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I have written testimony I'm going to
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
read I didn't hand it out because I was
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
still editing it but um I do want to
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
thank representative Mooney for the hard
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
work she put into this bill and to the
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
amendment as many of you know marac has
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
been dealing with past contamination of
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
our groundwater since at least 2016
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's when it was first
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
reported and um P asked just to give
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
some of you a background our class of
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are termed forever
 
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are termed forever
chemicals

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
because of their resistance to
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
degradation their primary mode of
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
contamination of the environment and
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
their bio accumulation in humans and
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
pets begins in
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
soil pasas deposited on soil from
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
industrial operations leeches into
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater and finds its way into
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
public and private Wells thus
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
contaminating the drinking water for
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
people and animals served by those Wells
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment will allow
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
Dees an opportunity to address
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
contamination earlier and closer to its
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
original Source thus reducing the
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
likelihood that it will reach
 
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
groundwater at presently we address the
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
contamination in groundwater this bill
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
allows us to back up back up back up to
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
soil and eventually to the the the point
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
source of the
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
contamination another reason I I support
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment is by empowering Dees to
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
require testing of other pasas will
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
enable New Hampshire to respond to
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
evolving scientific understanding and
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
also address the wackamole issue when
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers alter a molecule or
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
placement of an atom on a molecule to
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
make it into another
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
pasas that evades regulation so for
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
instance if um
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
PFA is regulated it's it's
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
not very difficult for a company to
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
substitute it with another molecule very
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
similar but different that it's not
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
under those regulatory
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
requirements Dees recognizes that the
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
more we can manage peas as a class of
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals bring all of these different
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
molecules together the more we can
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
ensure New Hampshire stays on top of
 
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.789 align:start position:0%
ensure New Hampshire stays on top of
these

00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
substitutions companies may make to
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
newer generations of molecules because
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
if you'll see there is a there is a
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
clause in the amendment that allows Dees
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
to to test all they can be required to
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
test all past not just the ones under
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
regulation so finally the assignment of
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
liability and responsibility in lines 24
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
and 26 of the amendment will provide
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
innocent well owners faster and more
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
efficient way of getting safe water
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
outside of engaging in lengthy and exp
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
expensive legal process the amendment is
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
good for families the environment and
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
the state and I urge you to support it
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm welcome to
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative any excuse me any
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
rung representative eron thank you Mr
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative rung for
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony this morning and thank
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'm
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
interested to know um
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
we we know now we have these
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated places and Wells and
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
contaminated soil in marac how are
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
people dealing with that contamination
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
now what do they have to do okay thank
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question um first
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
let me preface I should also say that I
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
also serve as chairperson of the HB 737
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
pasas commission it's h it was
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
established in law in 2019 to address
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
the environmental and health
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
implications of the contamination caused
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
by Sano Bane performance Plastics um but
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
the that contamination is not just
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
restricted to miramac miramac I guess
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
ground zero but it also includes the
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
communities of Bedford Lichfield and
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
recently uh lenary was added to the
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
commission because of the extent of um
 
00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.870 align:start position:0%
commission because of the extent of um
the

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
plume um when that contamination first
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
was discovered and brought to the
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
attention of De s Dees and S gobain
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
entered into what's called a consent
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
degree it's a settle a legal settlement
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
that outlines the responsibility that
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
SLE Bane has in this
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
situation um and I'm I'm sure Dees can
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
can go into this in more detail but what
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
it requires of Sinco Bain is that within
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
a certain boundary that's defined in
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
that consent degree um when water is is
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
um tested it to be more than the legal
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
limit s gban has to provide alternate
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
water so we actually have hundreds and
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
hundreds of families who have been on
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
bottled water since
 
00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:40.829 align:start position:0%
bottled water since
2016

00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
2016
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
2017 in some cases where um the
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods have been so impacted and
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
um the access to infrastructure s gobain
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
has um paid to have um Municipal
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
waterline hookups to to neighborhoods so
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
some people have gotten uh they're now
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
on Municipal Water they've abandoned
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
their their private well and now they
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
they have to pay to be on public water
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
because it's safer um some people who
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
aren't in a convenient location for that
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
are on bottled water and um I also
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
believe some families have um installed
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
whole house filtration or at least uh um
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
usually it's a granulated activated
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
carbon system where water coming into
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
the house the pasas is removed before it
 
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
Services faucets so um that's that's
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
really about the only way you can remove
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
P from water is um by going to an
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
alternate source that you know is safe
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
or removing it as it's coming into the
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
house I hope I answered your question
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
yes you did thank you and follow up
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
follow up good so besides water
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
contamination are there
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
other contamination going on soil in so
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
far as you know can these people grow
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
gardens in their backyard and well I
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
know for the um Community across the
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
street from St gobain it's a condominium
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
Community called Webster green those
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
people have been instructed not to
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
Garden don't disrupt the soil um it's
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
been found in dust on wind on window
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
sills um but until soil testing becomes
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
more widespread and the science of of
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
that analysis becomes well
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
more well documented I guess um there's
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
really no way of knowing how much soil
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
is in someone's yard I mean we've spent
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
the last several years as a state um
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
testing just getting getting a handle on
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
the extensiveness of the groundwater
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
contamination I mean you asked um
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney about how we know
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
who is responsible well many times you
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
can look at the plume of contamination
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
by testing and work your way back to the
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
point source of that contamination we
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
also know um companies that use these
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
products in their manufacturing and so
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
naturally it would make sense that they
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
may you know just in their waste removal
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
of their process that you know they they
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
use so much that it it's likely that
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
they might be a point source so there is
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
another company similar to Sano bank
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
called TCI which is also been found to
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
be a source also firefighting foam um
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
not so much anymore but pasas was
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
commonly used in firefighting foam
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
that's why we see the contamination at
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
peas um from their their um use of
 
00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:40.750 align:start position:0%
peas um from their their um use of
firefighting

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
firefighting
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
foam I hope I answered your question yes
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
welcome so it actually generates a
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
question I was going to say for director
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
whims app but I'll I'll throw it to you
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
if you can answer it okay I hope so
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
we'll see so if we put this into place
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
what remed remediation practices would
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
be available what do you envision I mean
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
are we talking soil removal and
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
replacement or or are there other types
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
of remediation practices that are
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
available well just speaking up about
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
myself um I I think it really depends on
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
the concentration I think and and it
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
also depends on the
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
soil's um the geometry of it to the
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
underlying if there's Bedrock or
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater there may be some situations
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
where the soil has to be removed there
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
may be some situations where there might
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
be a pump and treat well installed which
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
would it's a well that it'll pump the
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater remove the pasas and put it
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
back um so I think it really depends on
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
the concentration and the um the the
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
soil chemistry that would either
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
encourage or maybe inhibit that leeching
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
into groundw some soils May retain the
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
pasas more than other
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
soils so I guess guess I didn't answer
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
your question chairman Pearl no you did
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
fine I I always am concerned if we're
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to put a practice into rules that
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's at least a practice available to
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
satisfy that rule so thank you any other
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
questions see none we thank you for
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
it so next we will call up uh director
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
whims and sorry the second name Bonner
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct all right I I'll allow
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
you to introduce yourself from Dees
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
Mike winsat I serve as director of the
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
Services with me here today is Wendy
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
boner who is uh the uh rules coordinator
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
for our hazardous waste management
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau and uh she would be here to speak
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
speak to any of the specific questions
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
about sections 3 through eight of the
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
testify uh in support of this amendment
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
1547 uh Dees supports the amendment and
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
uh I want to just briefly go through the
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
three sections and then uh both Wendy
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
and I will be happy to field any
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have uh first
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
of all the first section uh directs uh
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
Dees to conduct uh to initiate rul
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
making um by no November of 2023
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
relative to specifically addressing past
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
contamination and specific very
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
specifically to develop and begin uh Ru
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
making for establishing soil standards
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the four past chemicals that we
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
currently regulate in groundwater and
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
those soil standards would need to be
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
protective of groundwater quality so the
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of that is that as you've
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
heard from previous from the sponsor and
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Rong is that uh when uh
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
in particular in Southern New Hampshire
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
when we had uh uh a significant amount
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
of pasas uh falling being emitted into
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
the air being deposited onto the ground
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
getting into and onto the soil that then
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
percolated the rainwater falls down on
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
that and then that percolated down leech
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
down into the groundwater aquifer both
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
in the overburden and the sand and
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
gravel aquifer and in the Bedrock
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
aquifer so we have many hundreds of uh
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells in the the five
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
town area that was discussed that have
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
been impacted by that contamination so
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
um I do want to make it clear we um
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
already established soil standards for
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
many compounds we have that that are
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
based on the numbers are based on uh a
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
desire to protect groundwater quality so
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
we already have authorities to set
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
standards for soil to protect
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality um but we have not
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
done that yet for pasas and one of the
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
reasons we haven't done it yet is that
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
Pas chemistry indry is is quite a bit
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
more complicated than many of the other
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh chemicals that we that we regulate
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
and we we came uh to the conclusion
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
several years ago that we could not use
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
our usual methods we had a certain model
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
that we used to sort of model how a
 
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
contaminant moves through soil and then
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
gets into the groundwater and it works
 
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
pretty well for a lot of chemicals but
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't work well and it's not
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate for pasas so um what we've
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
done is uh I and I'm I'm jumping ahead a
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
little bit but uh We've as
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney indicated we hired
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
the USGS we have a contract with them to
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
do a three-part study and the first
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
thing they've done which is largely done
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we're waiting for the report on it
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
is to go and look at soil concentrations
 
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
for pasas throughout the state the idea
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
that pasas is a global contaminant it
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
has been deposited on all pretty much
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
all parts of the Earth because of its
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
expansive use in Commerce and we wanted
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
to understand just in the absence of the
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
local source of past contamination what
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
do soils look like in the state so there
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
were over a 100 soil samples taken
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
across the state in locations where we
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
didn't have any particular reason to
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
believe that there was any local
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
contamination Source just trying to look
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
at background soil concentrations so
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
that's the first part of the USGS study
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
the second part is to go and then obtain
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
soil samples from specific sites where
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
we know we have pasas
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
contamination and bring and and also
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
obtain soil samples of different soil
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
types from around the state that aren't
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
contaminated by any local source and do
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
laboratory studies to see how past
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals interact with those soils how
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
fast they move through them whether
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're you know bound to them and
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
retained by them that helps give us
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
information about how we would then go
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
about setting a a leeching standard for
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
for soil for past and then the third
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
part of the study is to do some field
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
studies at some existing past sites we
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
do have a number of sites where past
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
have been released um and to go and
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
actually do some infield studies to see
 
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
how p is interacting with the soils at
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
that site and how it's moving through
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
those soils to get to groundwater so I I
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
hope I'm not going too far into that but
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
I want you to understand the the breadth
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
of this USGS study so we're waiting for
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
that we expect to have the report on
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
those three parts by the fall of 2022 as
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney indicated and then once
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
we have that we'll need to use that
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
information to then do some further
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
development and modeling to f figure out
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
what the numbers should be it's very
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
possible that we will propose through
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
the normal rulem process so there' be
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity for public
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
participation in that but it's very
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
possible that we may propose um
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
something we haven't done with other
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals which is uh soil type based
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
standards so when you have a site that
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
has certain kind of soil um it might
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
have a different standard for past
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
contamination than another soil type
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
because the p moves differently or at a
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
different speed in that type of soil so
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's maybe more than you need to know
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
for now but that gives you an idea why
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
we need this time to do do this work
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
very carefully and then go through the
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
normal rulem process to establish soil
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
cleanup standards and as uh
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative rung indicated a second
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
part of that first section uh will allow
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
us to do really what's kind of happening
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
anyways but it'll give us more clear
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
Authority um and that is to uh look to
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
parties who examining their sites or
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
doing monitoring to not just test for
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
the four compounds but test for an
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
expanded list of compounds most folks
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
are already doing that but um the
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
problem is that there are a handful of
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
past compounds that are beginning to
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
emerge as perhaps a concern that we
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't yet regulate and the problem is is
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
if we if we wait until it's determined
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem then we have no
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
data about those compounds where they
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
exist where they're a problem so looking
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
ahead at the that the handful of
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
compounds that we are concerned about
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
and getting data on that ahead of time
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
before we look to set some kind of
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard or soil standard
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be very helpful to us I
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be more protective
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the public as a result so um the
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
second part of the uh Bill basically uh
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
amends the groundwater protection act
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
and and and and does two things there
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
one it clarifies some existing authority
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
to establish soil standards as I said we
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
already have a host of soil standards
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
for a number of compounds but this just
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
clarifies it and and makes it clear that
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing is setting
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
standards to protect groundwater and to
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
protect human health so the idea is that
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
we and we already do this with our soil
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
standards in some cases we have two
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
standards one is a is a number that we
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
determine would be protective of
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality so a number in the
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
soil a concentration of the soil where
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have an impact above
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater standards in the soil and
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
another one is human health where it's
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
just direct contact so it might be a
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
different number if you're just trying
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
to protect children playing in the soil
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
because you know kids play in the dirt
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
and they eat a little bit of the dirt
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
and they get um an exposure that way and
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
so the analysis and and the work that
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
you need to do to set those standards is
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
different so this just makes it clear
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
that those two things are appropriate um
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
criteria that we should be using to set
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
soil standards and then the second part
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
of that is uh it's a clarification but
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
also putting a little finer Point making
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
more explicit our authority to require
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
persons who are responsible for um
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
contamination of of groundwater as a
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
result of their emissions and this is
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
not with respect specifically to P but
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
really to any contaminant um uh or who
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know somehow they're either liable
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
under the law for what's happened or
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
they just simply cause the release of a
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
contaminant that has a groundwater
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
quality standard so the idea is that if
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
you um if a person whether it's a
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
company or an individual uh diso
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
improperly disposes of a contaminant and
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
it gets into the groundwater and impacts
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
an individual person's drinking water
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
well they have a responsibility to
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
provide safe alternate water and that
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
for that person which could be putting
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
treatment on the well or in some cases
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
could be connecting them to a public
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
water system I want to emphasize this is
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
something that's happened for years Dees
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
has a site remediation program where we
 
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.510 align:start position:0%
has a site remediation program where we
have

01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh required individual parties who have
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
caused contamination to provide
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
alternate water um that includes
 
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
companies that have had big releases and
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
impacted people's wells in a
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it includes municipalities
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
who have a landfill who's impacted you
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
know a couple of neighbors next to the
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
landfill drinking water as a result of
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
releases from the landfill um in answer
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
to representative aon's question we have
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
a long history at Dees of of making
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
those analyses to figure out you know is
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
is this something that really happened
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
did this person really caus the
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
contamination and uh the way that we do
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
that is through really traditional um
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
soil and groundwater investigations so
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
we have the the party who who if you've
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
had a documented release you're already
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
required under the law to do site
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
investigation put in groundwater
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells do soil samples and it
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
sort of almost becomes a a game of
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
connect the dots so if you have a l a
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
you know a site here and a well that's
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
impacted here and you do the study in
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
between those two places to look at soil
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
and groundwater quality can you make a a
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument that that that yes
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
that releases what caused that well to
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
be contaminated in some cases it's very
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
clear we have parties that you know just
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
say yep it's us and we'll provide the
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
alternate water in other cases it may
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
not be that clear um and it may be very
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
difficult may be a very complex
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological setting where it's hard
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
to tell and certainly if a party feels
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
like they're being unjustly accused of
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
causing that problem they have all the
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
the remedies available to them they can
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
appeal if if we ask them to do it and
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
they refuse to do it but we're confident
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
that it's their responsibility we might
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
issue them in administrative order they
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
have the right to appeal that and have
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
that heard before the council and the
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
courts or if uh we had if we took them
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
to court to do it they obviously have
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
their rights to to to uh to fight that
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
in in in the legal setting in the court
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
setting so um that's the second part and
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
then the the third part is
 
01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
um uh and I want emphasize that I know
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's confusing reading the amendment
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
sections 3 through S there the changes
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we are making actually don't change
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the regulated
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
Community one bit this is not creating
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
new responsibilities it's not creating
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
new law or making somebody who wasn't
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
responsible to do something now
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
responsible we have a hazardous waste uh
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
generator certification program that is
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
limited to um small quantity what we
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
have up to now called small quantity
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
generators those folks who generate less
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
than 220 pounds of hazardous waste per
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
month and there are 3,000 there there
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
are over 3,000 of those entities small
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state that generate
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
relatively small amounts of hazardous
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
waste they have a host of requirements
 
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
that apply to them but they're not as
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
significant or robust as the
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to larger
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
generators who generate more waste but
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
they do have to comply with those as you
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
can imagine we can't have a fleet of
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors that can go out and regularly
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
inspect 3,000 generators so what we do
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
is a number of years ago we established
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
this small quantity generator
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
self-certification program which we
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
essentially administer with one or two
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
people basically um and it's very
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and worked very effectively
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
where every three years if you're one of
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
these small quantity generators your
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to basically do a self
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
audit look at the rules look at what
 
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
your requirements are see if the way
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
that you're managing your waste is in
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with those
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
and fill out a form that that
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative K refer to and that form
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
would not change um and and basically uh
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
self-certified that you're in compliance
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
with the rules um or if you're not let
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
us know that and and seek whatever help
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
you need to come into compliance and
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
then we do some auditing with interns to
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
try to kind of check that as well or
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
with our inspectors but it's been a very
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
successful program none of that changes
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
this is will be exactly that program
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
will be run exactly the same way it'll
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
apply all the same people but what we'll
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
what we're changing here is that because
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
when we created that program we put this
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
term small quantity generator language
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the statute just to be descriptive
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
because that's what we called it the
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
problem is if you go back in time um we
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
have a program for hazardous waste uh
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
management and regulation that is uh
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
essentially analog to the federal
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
program and when the federal law came
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
down in the n in the mid1 1970s to
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
establish responsibility for hazard
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
space Generation Um states were had the
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop their own
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
programs and then seek authorization to
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
implement the program in Le of the
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
federal government we did that it's been
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
a very successful program for for you
 
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
know 40 years now um but when we did
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
that we we we used we chose to use
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
slightly different terms to describe the
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
the different sizes of generators and
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the letter shows a table there that
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
compares how the terminology that we use
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
is not the same as the terminology that
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government uses and that's
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
worked okay we' spent a lot of time
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
educating generators but we have a
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
number of businesses as you know who who
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
work in more than one state they have
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
facilities in more than one state and
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's created confusion and some
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in terminology because um
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
what we call a small quantity generator
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
um is not the same thing as what the
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
federal government might call a small
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
quantity generator in the past so as a
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
result um if for businesses that work in
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
more than one State when we start using
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
our terminology they look at us crossy
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
and get kind of confused and say that
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense you know what what
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
are you saying and so what we decided is
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
that without changing our rules or
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
changing the way we regulate these
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
parties we want to align our terminology
 
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
with the federal government so we
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
eliminate that confusion make our rules
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
and our program easier to understand and
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
more user friendly for the business
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
Community it's also going to facilitate
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
as we move forward with uh we're
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
required as you know EPA has develops
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
new rules related to hazardous waste all
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
the time we're required to adopt those
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
rules on a schedule to maintain the
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
authorization of our program and the
 
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
approval from the federal government of
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
our program as we do that it'll be much
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
easier to do that if we're using the
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
same terminology and that's really what
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
this is about so again it it's easy to
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
conclude that it's changing something
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it it really doesn't what it really
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
does is it scrubs this language about
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
small quantity or very small quantity
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
out of the stat statute puts it in rules
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
where it belongs so if this amendment
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
were to pass and these Provisions were
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
to change in the Hazardous way statutes
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
what we would do along the heels of that
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
is then go into our rulemaking process
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
and change this terminology to align it
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the federal terminology and then
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
we'd have consistent terms being used
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
between us and the federal government
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken far too long and I we'll
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you director I guess
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'll start with one that I have so
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
looking at the original Bill there were
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed in the fiscal note
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
about the quantities that and
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
limitations that were set originally in
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
in the statute yes and looking at the
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
amendment those have all been taken out
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
and correct sort of put to the rules
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
making process and I I guess on line 15
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
it says such rules may include a
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
requirement for testing for pfas other
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
than those for which the state currently
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
has a groundwater quality standard
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
standard one of the purviews of our
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
committee obviously is is agricultural
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
policy and looking at that and I know
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
there was some concern expressed in the
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note about uh its effect
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
on biosolid
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
application do you perceive that as you
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
go through the rul making process that
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
the standards that you will want to set
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
will have that same impact on the
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
application of biosolids our
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community depends a lot on
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
those for the production of of many
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
crops sure that's a great question I'm
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
glad you asked that um and in fact the
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
USGS study that we're doing will include
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
a site where biosolids have been land
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
applied um to try to understand that
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
that's been a concern we have you you if
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
you're involved in that Community you
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
may know Anthony um uh now I'm
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
forgetting I've known Anthony for years
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
Anthony uh is a is a person who does the
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
biosolids regulation program at Dees
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
he's been a just a Stead fast Champion
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
for you know trying to make sure that we
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
do that in in the most careful and
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate way and it's been a very
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
successful program it's something that
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at carefully we know that
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
um it seems that what's happened in
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
Maine was in large part um a result of
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
paper mill sludges that were part of the
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
biosolids we don't have as much of a
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
history of that being part of biosolids
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as they do in Maine um
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
having said that there are you know
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
there when biols are mismanaged and we
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
had a facil faity that actually um was a
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
processing facility for those materials
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
that did have impacts on near nearby
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells with pasas and so
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
we've had to deal with that specifically
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
um to address that having said that um
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing we're still studying it
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
but we're not seeing similar impacts um
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
at at biosolid facilities that have just
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
been utilized in for an Agricultural
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
purpose um but that's something that I I
 
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
guess the best way to answer the
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
question question is we we're
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
specifically making that part of the
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
USGS study because we want to understand
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
more about that and we and by with the
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
authorities and the and the directive
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
that this gives us it would give us an
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
tailor you know specific standards and
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
practices to the bio solids application
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
so that that could you know be addressed
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
in a way that was practical and
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know would allow for
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
continued appropriate use of biosolids
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I know I know it was a bit of
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
a complicated question it is indeed yeah
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
but I I appreciate the answer and we
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate your attention to
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
that matter because it is quite
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
important to the agricultural community
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I I got to give Anthony
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
credit Anthony drwan is fair enough well
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
I put you on the spot so any other
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bix yes thank you for
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um first off I'd like
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
to thank you for all the work that you
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
did on this amendment I looked at the
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
original bill and I thought but this
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have this doesn't really have a
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
real effect uh and it's not going to be
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
useful and this amendment completely
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
changes that and I think this is uh uh
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
Leaps and Bounds ahead of the original
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill um but my question has to do with
 
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh the representative Rong mentioned
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
that uh there are uh chemicals that are
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
um not the the P chemicals that are not
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that are currently have
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
standards and suggested that the they
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
those chemical variants might be have
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
been intentionally made to to vary so
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't fit under the standards
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
and I my impression was that uh when
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with Fass it's it's all a
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
waste product that is the result of not
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
your intended chemical operation but uh
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
sort of the byproduct of uh the thing
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
you're really trying to make and because
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
chemical reactions are complicated they
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
spew out more than just the isolated
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
things that you're planning to make uh
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
or that you would initially anticipate
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering is there any intention
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
in the ones that don't fit under the the
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
the current regulations or is it that
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
they just haven't been uh assessed yet
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
and they need to be assessed in order to
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
see if you know make figure out how they
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
fit into the the um the standards sure
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so it needs to
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
be said there are literally thousands of
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
pasas compounds um it's certainly it's
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's a complex little bit complex answer
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
to your question I think the the simple
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
answer is it's yes both um what you
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
described is a condition that exists
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes but it's also true that very
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
specific chemistry is designed for
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
specific uses it is you know as we
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand it um you know if you think
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
about a pasas compound it's basically a
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
carbon chain with some kind of
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
functional group on the end of but all
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
the carbons are just saturated with
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
Florine atoms that's it just Florine
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
atoms in one particular case it appears
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
industry uh designed a chemical that
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
would have one um hydrogen one Florine
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
replaced with hydrogen so that it would
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
basically not be the regulated chemical
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's a concern for us too so we
 
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
have to pay attention to these things
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're complex um it's
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
also the case that you know for good
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
reason reason um the industry will
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
Design when when when a particular
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
chemical is identified as a health risk
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
they'll try to design a chemical that
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a health risk that
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
does the same thing chemically that
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do in Whatever
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing process and so as those
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
chemicals be become used more frequently
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at those in in the
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
toxicology Community nationally in
 
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
globally are looking at those chemicals
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
to see if those are a concern so what
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
you have is you have a host of you know
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
we have the four compounds we regulate
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
right now and the reason we regulate
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
them is we have quite a bit of
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
information that they may pose a health
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
risk and we we know quite a bit about
 
01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
their prevalence we know how they were
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
used in industry and we know that that
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about their potential
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
to harm health so we're able to use the
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
information on that use good science to
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
set defensible standards in groundwater
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
and drinking water for those for those
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
compounds there's a whole host of other
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
ones where we don't have those
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
conditions we may not know very much
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
about where it's used or how it's used
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
we may not know very much about um where
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
it exists here in in in the state in in
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
soil and groundwater and we may not know
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
much about the toxicology so but but as
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the the the the
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
community of toxicologists and
 
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
researchers are constantly looking at
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
this and new information emerges as that
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
new information emerges a particular
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
chemical may rise to the top and say
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
wellow we're a little bit concerned
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
about this and we're going to do more
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
work on that we don't have enough
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
information to really develop a
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
defensible standard right now but we
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
know we need to look at it and what I'm
 
01:23:58.990 --> 01:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting with with this build just Mak
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
when we identify those compounds we
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
might be able to say look we don't have
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
a standard for this right now but when
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
you are looking at your soil or your
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater for these Ford regulated
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
contaminants we'd also like you to look
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
for this one that sounds complicated in
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
practice it's pretty easy because what's
 
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
happening is the um Laboratories who
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
routinely do this work really they they
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
have an expand panel already in their so
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
if you order up a past test you actually
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to order custom to get the four
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
compounds if you order a standard past
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
test you'll get a panel depending on
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
which test you pick you may get a panel
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
of 17 or 25 or 39 but the idea is is
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
that this just makes this bill would
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
just make it clear that it's it's that D
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
has the authority to ask to look at some
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
of these additional
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
compounds thank
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
you representative a
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
question so I'm curious to know how
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
other states are dealing with this uh
 
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
issue and are there more are there
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
states that are more successful than
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
others and where does New Hampshire
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
stand in that Continuum of States well
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
that's a terrific question there are a
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
number of states who are dealing with
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
this I mean basically any state that
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't think it has a past problem
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't looked because these compounds
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
are so widely used in Commerce that
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
there we can guarantee that there is
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
soil and groundwater contamination of P
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
pass in every state and Most states that
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
have done the work have have confirmed
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
that regionally um the states of Vermont
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
and New York State have had and New
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
Jersey have had to deal with this
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem pretty extensively and in fact
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
the the same sort of saga that started
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
with us in March of
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
2016 started one month earlier in
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont so I was at a meeting with my
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
2016 he took a call during the meeting
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
and when the problem emerged there in
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
North Bennington and they had very
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
significant impacts just like we had as
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
a result of air emissions of p in North
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
Bennington a month later we we we dove
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
into that because we learned that we had
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
the same situation in marac um so I
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
guess the the short answer is that uh
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
New York State Vermont New Jersey have
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
worked very effectively to do this you
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure I'm I'm the right
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
person ask is I'm probably biased I
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
think we have done in New Hampshire um
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
probably more
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh aggressive sampling of groundwater
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
and soil um than any other state because
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
we've had to um and I will say our our
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Vermont are probably a
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
close second and New York State uh also
 
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
has done just tremendous work but it's
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh every state responds to the specific
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
problems that they're dealing with um I
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
think we we still have a lot of work to
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
do I mean we have a number of people at
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
Dees many people um who work every day
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
almost all of their work is focused on
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
Pas because of you know we've never had
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
anything like this before where we
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
literally have um you know thousands of
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
homes in Southern New Hampshire um that
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
have been impact who drinking water have
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
been impacted by these contaminants so
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's an outsized response but it's an
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
outsized problem thank you additional
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
question if I may followup thank
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
you uh my my second question is do these
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
P compounds occur naturally at all no
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
they are entirely synthetic they were
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
invented in a chemistry lab uh back in
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
the early
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
1940s thank
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
you so that's actually a good segue to a
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask so like with
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
oil spills and things of that nature
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
there are microbial things that can
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
occur that sort of help break these
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
compounds down and and take care of them
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
naturally do any of uh any microbial
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
action or any other type of things we
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
can do exist for re remediation of these
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
P components once they're in soil or is
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
it strictly removable and or you know
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
some of the other things we talked about
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
pumping filter and things of that nature
 
01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
I believe there's some very limited
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that microbial action can
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
impact the degradation of these
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
compounds but it is very limited and
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
very slow these are you know one of the
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
reasons they're so widely used in
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
Commerce is they're very unique and
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're really powerful
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
chemicals in the sense that they they
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
have the ability simultaneously to repel
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
water and repel oils and grease which
 
01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:31.639 align:start position:0%
almost nothing does it's usually one or
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the other right these can do both and
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
there and it has to be said these are
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
very important products I mean the the
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
the Teflon and and the various variants
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
of pasas um are used in products that
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
that uh you know make all kinds of
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
important medicine very you know
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
possible um you name it I mean they're
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're used in so many
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
different ways because they are very
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
valuable and useful um and you know one
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that Dees has said is that
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
you know if a heart valve needs Teflon
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
we want we want them to be able to make
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
that heart valve but if a hamburger
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
paper needs it to keep the grease out
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not the highest and best
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
use so society's going to have to make
 
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
decisions about where they really want
 
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
to use these compounds where it's makes
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
sense and it's important and any risks
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
are worth you know worth managing in
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
other places where Maybe they're not and
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's not something we're going to do
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
here but nationally and globally those
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
decisions are are you know starting to
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
be made and you know at some level the
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
industry is is making those decisions
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
too they you know if they have a
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
high-end need to make a product that
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
can't be made any other way they're
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
going to do it but if they've got a
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
product they could do another way and
 
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
not take on the risk of using p the
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
industry and commerce already making
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
those decisions to eliminate from those
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
products thank you representative
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
my question thank you for taking my
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
question so one one question that I do
 
01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:03.639 align:start position:0%
have for the Department is that we have
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
talked at length about potential
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
remediation strategies and I think a
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
previous speaker had mentioned that um
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
individuals were instructed not to drink
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
or use their soil in that manner and you
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
also mentioned an incoming report due in
 
01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
next year or excuse me October 2022 is
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
that correct around that time yes yeah
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so in which case I guess I'm
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
wondering is that perhaps when when will
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
those remediation strategies be
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
available to folks or what what are the
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
next steps to getting folks some
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
Remediation in those
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
areas thank you for the question so
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
really that that's a two-part question
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
the the question on drinking water is
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
pretty easy it's it's not easy or
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
inexpensive but it's it's it's it's
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
known techn technology we can very
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
effectively treat drinking water with
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
granulated activated carbon it can also
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
be you know uh treated under the sink at
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
a you know just a local point of use
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
treatment filter for a a kitchen sink
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
using reverse osmosis so there are
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
existing tested well-known affordable
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
Technologies for removing past from from
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water so that piece is really
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
just about resources and time we don't
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
need necessarily new research to get it
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're waiting for a
 
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
breakthrough on on that we we have
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
tested Technologies to take care of that
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
um on the soil side it's be much more
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
difficult there really um there's some
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
work going on that looks at treating of
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
actually sludge and um and soil through
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
some sophisticated methods that are
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
still kind of in the research and pilot
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
phase and they may come um but the
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
reality is if you look at I like to talk
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
about in the context of Southern New
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the problem is so huge
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire that even if you
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
had a costeffective technology for
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
treating soil it's just the magnitude of
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
it you know there's just the the what
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
amounts to millions of tons of soil that
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
may have detectable concentrations of
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
pasas we're not going to be looking at a
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
remedial technology now on in the
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
aggregate right so basically what we'll
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
look at is making sure that people have
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
safe drinking water either through
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
treatment or a public water system in
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire so they're not
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
getting Expos osed and then we're going
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
to look at soil concentrations to make
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
sure that locally where they might get
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
exposed to those soils they're not
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
getting an exposure that's unsafe in
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
most cases we've not seen based on what
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
we understand right now concentrations
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
in soil in except maybe you know and
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
very close into the plant site that
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
would pose a risk to somebody playing in
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
the soil you know a kid playing in the
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
soil or something like that so the main
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
concern is about whether those soils
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
pose a risk to groundwater and the
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
reality is in Southern New Hampshire
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
that will probably be the casee for many
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
years to come and there won't be a lot
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
we can do about that other than to make
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
sure people have sources of clean
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
drinking water um on an individualized
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
basis on a site there may well be
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
technologies that will be available
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
right now we have other you know sort of
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill contaminants if you will
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
that aren't past where it's also
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
impracticable to to treat the soil and
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
and we we rely on um institutional
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
controls like putting a cap on the soil
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
or you know basically eliminating
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
contact with it elim ating rain water
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
from falling on it so that it can't
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
percolate down into the groundwater so
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
um the short answer is we don't have a
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a Magic Bullet for treating soil
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure we're going to have one
 
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.390 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure we're going to have one
anytime

01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
soon thank you thank you representative
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
vix thank you for taking my question so
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if uh there's an issue
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
with uh the uptake of f past chemicals
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
by agricultural crops
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
that's a terrific question it's one
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been Fielding really
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
since the first pro the problem was
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
identified in
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
2016 um unfortunately the the amount of
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
research available for that is not large
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
there has been some research and I think
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
there's increasing research looking at
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
uptake by agricultural plants by food
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
crop plants of P um right now to be
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
honest I think our knowledge about that
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
at Dees is still in its infancy um we're
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's more work going on there's work
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
in other states they're looking at that
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
and um it it it can be a concern um but
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
I think that based on everything we've
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
seen so far the primary route of
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
exposure that is really the one that is
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
of concern for humans is the drinking
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
water and the whole idea is it's a
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
matter of dose right because you know
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
most people are getting through cooking
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
or drinking you know two liters or more
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
of water a day so that's your primary
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
exposure you're ingesting that water
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's a direct impact um and the
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural piece is obviously um it's
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a few steps removed plus
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know people don't eat the very same
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
thing all day long all three meals so
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
even if one part of their diet might
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually have a a vegetable or or crop
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
of some kind that has peast in it
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're probably not getting a very big
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
dose because you know unless they're you
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
know always eating the same thing all
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
the time um so it but but again our
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that is still pretty
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
limited and we're we're still looking at
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
that all right seeing no more questions
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
oh we do have one in the back
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
representive Perez for taking my
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
question my question to you is um I know
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
that um marac London der Le feel is
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
those the areas that more concerned
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
right now but I just wonder if a Dees is
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to be checking other areas with
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
single Von has uh buildings and um
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
for example in my area we already have a
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
superai of soil contamination from
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
previous company so we already have that
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
issue and the soil was removed and we
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
not allowed to drink the water so we
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
have water coming from another town but
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
even though we already have the
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
soil remove and bring new soil into the
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
area we have a a a problem with um soil
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
in miler and uh we have to even put
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
whole filtration system in our houses
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
because we getting um uh Rush skin rush
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
and other issues related to either soil
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
or water I just wonder if you guys
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about taking those areas with
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
sovian and other companies may be
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
contaminating the water and the
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
soil yes thank you that that's a
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
terrific question and and again you know
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
we manage somewhere on the order of 7 or
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
800 hazardous way sites in the state
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
investiga director could I get you to
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
turn your mic back on I I think I hit
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
you off by mistake they probably wanted
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
me to stop
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
but um yeah thank you for the question
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
we have about 700 uh sites uh that we
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
manage at the state level 21 superf fund
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
sites that we managed in in concert with
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government and when we
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
discovered the p pass problem we we
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
didn't just we were working to be sure
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
we were working diligently in Southern
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to address that but we
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
realized that it was a Statewide
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
question so we actually um reviewed what
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
we knew about our sites we reviewed the
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state and tried to
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
identify which ones might be using
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
processes that would use past chemistry
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we went out and indeed we found a
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
handful of sites in places other than
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire where we have P
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
problems as a result um at the sites
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we already know know about like the
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
site you're I think you're talking about
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've got ongoing monitoring and what
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
we've done at all our Superfund sites
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
and at our state sites has asked folks
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
who were already doing groundwater
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring to include pfast testing in
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
their groundwater monitoring at least
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
one time to evaluate that and then if
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
they don't detect it they might not have
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
to continue monitoring but if it's
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
detected then pfast becomes a regular
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
part of their monitoring program so we
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
are looking at the sites that are in our
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
inventory to make sure that P is not an
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
additional contaminant that we didn't
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
know about and in some cases it is I
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
mean for example that you know land you
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
have 400 closed online landfills in the
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
state every single one of those
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
virtually that that we monitor for
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality we found pasas in
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
the groundwater and now that's part of
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring well thank you uh to both of
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
you for coming in and um I appreciate
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
all the information you've given us uh I
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
have no more pain cards is there anyone
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
else that would like like to speak on
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
this bill before I close the
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
hearing all right seeing none uh we'll
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
read the blue sheet we have uh four
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
signed in on the blue sheet two opposed
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
two supporting and we had 17 signed in
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
online in support so with that I will
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
1547

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:40:19.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay we are going to open up the hearing
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
1187 which is relative to milk
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
pasteurization and I'll call on
 
01:40:43.149 --> 01:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative Allard from marac 21 to
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
bill good morning and
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
the committee uh if I look Vaguely
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
Familiar it's because I have come before
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
you twice
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
previously uh with the exact same
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
language uh the first bill as some of
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
you may remember uh died as a part of
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
the Omnibus bills that uh died with
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
covid uh a couple of years back
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
now and uh a year later I resubmitted
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 95 live with the same
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
language uh to uh allow for the uh
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
production of ice cream as a product as
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
one of the allowed products of raw milk
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
production uh House Bill 95 uh went
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
through this committee
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh as had its predecessor uh
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
it went through the house on consent and
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
it and it's stalled in the Senate and it
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh we had even been been informed that
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
it would not pass the Senate and so uh
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
during the open Period uh this fall I
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
submitted House Bill 1187 again with the
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
same language uh to move uh uh to move
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
this process forward and uh at the same
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
time uh fortunate for me the bill uh
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
received a uh uh some sort of CPR in the
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
body across the wall and uh
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh rejuvenated by the good work of some
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
senators and uh if you have seen the
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor this morning on the
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
front page uh House Bill 95 uh has
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate uh it will come back
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
to us for a small uh amendment that the
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
senate had put on about labeling but uh
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 95 uh for right now is
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
alive and well which more or less makes
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1187
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
Superfluous uh but uh in keeping with a
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedure I must introduce
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
it to you um I perhaps would
 
01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:07.870 align:start position:0%
it to you um I perhaps would
uh

01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
until uh House Bill 95 is signed sealed
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
and delivered I might recommend to you
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
that you retain 1187 if that is your
 
01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.709 align:start position:0%
that you retain 1187 if that is your
good

01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
judgment uh and Beyond that uh I guess I
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
might suggest that I give it to you and
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
you could write some Omnibus amendment
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
to it and do other good things for the
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
agriculturalists of New Hampshire uh
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
with it but uh uh as far as uh the
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
production of raw milk ice cream 1187 uh
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
as I say is Superfluous now uh on the
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
assumption that 95 will get signed uh
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
sometime this
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
spring and with that I'd be happy to
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
take your questions Mr
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative so uh we don't have the
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
ability to retain because we're in the
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
second year of our of our uh session the
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
longest I could hold the bill would be
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
into early March but I'm not sure that
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to satisfy House Bill 95
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
passing through the rest of the
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
process so I guess um
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like a little feedback from
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
you would you like us to OTP this bill
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
and or do you are we fairly confident
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
that the governor is on board and we can
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
dispose of this bill as through an
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
itl uh Mr chairman uh with the the long
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
life of this process uh that we've had
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
thus far I'm not sure that I would uh I
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
would have the confidence to bank on
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything so uh
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
I I would throw myself at the mercy of
 
01:44:57.310 --> 01:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
the committee and say I think maybe then
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
we ought to uh OTP this bill and uh uh
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
and let something happen to it in
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
future one final question I would have
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
is the language that you submitted in
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
1187 does that contain the changes that
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate did in House Bill 95 uh no it
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
does not okay it it is as 995 was
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
originally if we're going to pass this
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill would it make sense to amend now
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that you're okay with the
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
the changes that were made would it make
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
sense to amend this bill to match that
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
of that came out of the Senate it would
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
indeed okay all right thank you that's
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
all the questions I have anybody
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
else seeing none we thank you appreciate
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
you next we have uh representative
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
Woodcock from I'm sorry I can't see who
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
you're representing but I'll let
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman unfortunately
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
word processing is much better than my
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
cursive and printing a Carol County 2
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
North Conway Eaton chattam uh I have had
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
the pleasure with representative Val for
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
the last three years to meet before this
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
group once again I think the first time
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
was OTP 20 the second time was OTP 190
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
and hopefully I disagree with my friend
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
over here I'd say OTP again uh 209
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the collection number is uh
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
when I came three years ago and it
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed uh Jim and I started this
 
01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
or he started and I jumped on we both
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
had two small goat farms in our
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
districts with people just trying to get
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
their their small amount of product to
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
help with some cash flow in the summer
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
doing some ice cream out of the front
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
Farm that's where all this started and
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
we still have the same two Farms however
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
they uh listened to Gemini uh which was
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
an error because they went out and
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
bought a freezer and one bought a
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
machine and think well 190 200 terrific
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
well now they're seeing there with this
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
equipment as well so we'd really
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if this time you could uh
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
continue to support this bill uh and
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
pass it once again uh forward because
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is this is nothing more that I
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
could possibly think of that helps
 
01:47:18.189 --> 01:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
directly the small family farm in New
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%

01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
basically here to Echo what the the
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Allard had had uh
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
testified to and asked I think as most
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
of you are aware um we've met with the
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and and uh representative
 
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
Aon as a co-sponsor was part of the
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
discussions Department of Agriculture uh
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
and and others uh couple years ago to so
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we were all on the same page and we
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
came to you and um so the one suggestion
 
01:48:22.589 --> 01:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
I would I would make clear that if if we
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
would support as as I I believe has been
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
indicated before that you grab the
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment and Tack that onto this
 
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill just to be sure um if you allow me
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would like to speak to to the
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 95 which is over in the
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and just remind you that that
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
bill has an effective date of 60 days
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
after passage so we would urge you to uh
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
act on that as soon as you can when it
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
come back to you and then urge the
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
governor to sign it soon because with
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
that 60 days it would be great to have
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
the law effective so the farmers can
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
utilize it for this summer season
 
01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
starting in June so I would say by the
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
at the uh latest we hope the governor
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
would sign up by mid April and I I'll
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
leave it at that and thank you as always
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mr
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
Johnson seeing none we thank you I do

have one uh final pink card that was put
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
DHS good morning and
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning for the record my
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
name is Colleen Smith I'm the
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
administrator of the food protection
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
section within DHHS and yes I um I've
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
been before this committee on regarding
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
this bill for a few times also um I just
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to go on the record that the
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
department feels strongly against the
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
expansion of raw milk products because
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the increased risk of foodborn
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
illness while the labeling um
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
declaration that's in the Senate version
 
01:49:52.589 --> 01:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
of of hb9 5 is in the right direction
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
there was a just so you're aware last
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
January there was a very significant
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
outbreak um so that's after I had
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
testified to this to this committee
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
previously where up to U more than 50
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
people were sickened across three states
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
due to raw milk production not raw milk
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
ice cream but raw milk so it just you
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
know it certainly brings home that there
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
are by doing more expansion this is this
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
is a risky product and we just want to
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
make sure um that our concerns are are
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
you happy to take any questions thank
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
you very much any
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
comto I thank you for taking my question
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering what states had the
 
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
outbreak so it was a New Hampshire based
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
Farm but because of the proximity to
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
this Farm to Massachusetts and the main
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
borders there were also residents from
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
other states that were sicken from
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
drinking the milk from this New
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Oregon thank you
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you very
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
much uh Miss Smith um do you think do
 
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
you think there's a uh extenuating do
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
you think maybe this bill is made less
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
bad because we're talking not about raw
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
milk but about uh yogurt and butter and
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
products which um already naturally have
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
some bacteria as part of the what I want
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
say processing but whatever the
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
culturing process for them well
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the concerns that we
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
have is the product ice cream that's
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's being expanded in this bill
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
because it's a product that is consumed
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
by young children and older old the
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
older population and those folks are
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
illnesses any further
 
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you for
 
01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you for
your

01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
testimony anybody else that uh wishes to
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
speak on this oh representative viby I
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
have a question to the chair okay um so
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh in term just in terms of the process
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the Senate Bill since it's amended do
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
we need to is there some sort of
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference that needs to
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
happen before it can go to the governor
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
or uh or how is that uh that difference
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
reconciled it's my understanding that
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
will come back to the house and we'll
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to aced to the
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
changes or ask for a committee of
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
conference okay so so um does that
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
accession need to be uh made in a full
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
session of the house uh we would have to
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
accept the changes and then be voted on
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
by the Full House to accept the
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee's um agreement to acced to the
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
changes okay so that needs both a vote
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
by our committee and a vote by the Full
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
House too that that is my understanding
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh is there any way to speed
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
that or do we just wait for the slow
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
wheels of government to get it over to
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
our side I've I've not in my experience
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
with the house found any way to make it
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
go any faster or as fast as I would like
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
to but I will certainly inquire and see
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
if we can move it along all right thank
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
you any uh any further testimony on this
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill all right seeing none I have the
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
blue sheet there is one sign in um in
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
support and there are 12 online in

gardening homesteading and organic food
 
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
production the purpose of this uh bill
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
is to encourage and protect the
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
sustainable cultivation of Fresh Foods
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%

residential and agricultural properties
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of personal uh

consumption and non-commercial sharing
 
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
additionally it seeks to promote the

development and and sustainability of
 
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
USDA organic certified agriculture at
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
all levels in New Hampshire by lowering
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
certification initially
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
um this bill came about because of
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
discussions I was having with voters in
 
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
my district um some were concerned that
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
they had seen in other states where um
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
the right for individuals to uh produce
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
their own food on their their property
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
had been
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
um ridden over by zoning and so forth
 
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
they were concerned about um the
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
grandfathering of these kind of Clauses
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
into um you know for them and as far as
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
I could tell I
 
02:04:41.709 --> 02:04:41.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a gardener I grew up on a 5 Acre
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
Farm in New York that was we were just
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
raising some sheep and some other things
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
it was very much for our own personal
 
02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:50.549 align:start position:0%
it was very much for our own personal
use

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not a lawyer so as far as I
 
02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
could tell by looking through things um
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
it seemed like the grandfathering was
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
there but I wanted to be sure so I went
 
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
in and talked with some folks and uh
 
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
produced this bill I tried very hard to
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that it didn't infringe on any
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
current laws or any potential Le
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
developing laws except to say that um
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the person if someone bought a piece of
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
property and it had they had the right
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
to do it that they retained that right
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
until the property was sold
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so I did that and as I was doing that
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
um another issue appeared and and some
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
some some other voters talked to me
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
about um organic farming and we had been
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
closing down the state certification
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
part of it being replaced by private
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
certifiers their concern was in the ca
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
cost of um the certification itself and
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
how it presented uh barriers to smaller
 
02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
operating um units so as I talked more
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
with people about that
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and wanting to promote this
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide I started looking and saying
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
well all of the the um steps that you
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
would take to become organic certified
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
those are tax deductions as far as I
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
again as far as I could tell but I
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to be make sure that that was the
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
case but the important thing was the
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
cost of certification had occurred to me
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um if we could do a tax credit uh for
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
people on that certification um where it
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't being paid for because I know
 
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
there are some things that get paid for
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
by the federal government but any part
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
that wasn't being paid for if we could
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
um provide a tax credit it would
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
eliminate the the financial burden and
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
would encourage people to um look into
 
02:06:54.910 --> 02:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
and consider organic farming um and so I
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
I had that written out and uh the uh
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services helped me
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
with where to put it because I had no
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
idea and hopefully I got it in the right
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
spot um but I think it's a good idea and
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for the um committee support
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative U I guess I'll I'll start
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
with a question of my own first so
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
well I understand the intent of the bill
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's as a committee we're always
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
looking at agricultural policy and we
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
always certainly try to Pro apply those
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities equally across all
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
spectrums of Agriculture be it you know
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
organic commercial or or any other type
 
02:07:38.189 --> 02:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
just curious is there a specific reason
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
you chose to give tax deduction
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to fees that um Organic
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
certification would do versus uh
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
commercial AGC culture as well the fees
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
that they pay okay
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
the the reason I did it for organic
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
certified is because that's the issue
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
that came before me um in reality in
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
looking at it I think that that there
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
could be quite significant advantage to
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
um allowing giving a tax credit allowing
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
people to
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
um get
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
certified um using the tax dollars that
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
they had you know that they're they're
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
putting into the state so um it's
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
basically giving them back the money
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
that they're they're they're paying into
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
the state as is in order to help them
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
develop further markets that they can
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
take advantage of and increase their
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
revenues so um I have no problem with um
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
applying it to pretty much any um
 
02:08:42.549 --> 02:08:42.559 align:start position:0%
certification that's going to do that
 
02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
for a business I think it's a good way
 
02:08:49.149 --> 02:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
to go it's not it's not utilizing uh
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
um other people's money it's it's
 
02:08:53.069 --> 02:08:53.079 align:start position:0%
literally giving them back the money
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
that they're they're putting in so um I
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
have no problem uh doing it for any of
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
them this just happened to be the one
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
that came before me thank you for the
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
question uh representative viby yes um
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused about the tax
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
credit because uh the credit would be
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
against business profits tax and my
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
impression is that uh there is a fairly
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
th fairly High net income threshold for
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
even beginning to pay for business
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
profits tax do you know of uh you know
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
what what size of oper of organic
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
operation would
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
be uh liable to um to to end up paying a
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
business profits tax when the the net
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
income I
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
think I'm I'm not I know it used to be
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
75,000 but I believe it is now 50,000 is
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
the the minimum that you need to be
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
netting in order to uh get uh to in
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
order to actually be liable for business
 
02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:00.270 align:start position:0%
order to actually be liable for business
profits

02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
tax um yeah again I I'm not a lawyer I'm
 
02:10:07.149 --> 02:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
not a tax lawyer um I I spoke with the
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
the folks at legislative services and
 
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out what you know what
 
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
tax would be best to to use um so if if
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
this is a situation where that is not
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to work I would be uh open to
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
amending it to a situation that would I
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
just think that um from a a a standpoint
 
02:10:25.079 --> 02:10:27.390 align:start position:0%
just think that um from a a a standpoint
of

02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
um these regulations presenting barriers
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
to smaller operations that aren't
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
presented to larger operations I just
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
think that by reducing those barriers um
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
we could uh encourage more people and
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
encourage the growth of these uh kind of
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
of um certifications in New Hampshire
 
02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
and that leads to markets that people
 
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
would otherwise not be
 
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
um that would not be available for
 
02:10:59.229 --> 02:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
people so if you're a Dairy Farmer and
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you can get organically certified you
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
can sell it to a yogurt uh Factory that
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
is um wanting organic milk to produce
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
their yogurt so from my perspective if
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
if that is not the right tax then um
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm not a tax lawyer so I'm
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to get the the concept and
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
move the concept forward thank you thank
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
question uh rep comto thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
02:11:33.870 --> 02:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
my question um having dealt with a lot
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
of people coming before our committee in
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
all types of Agriculture and farming um
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that businesses
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
choose to go organic is because they can
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
charge a substantially higher fee um so
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to someone in traditional
 
02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
farming um that doesn't have the will or
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
can't possibly do that due to other
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
barriers now because they get to charge
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
a higher fee um their profits are a
 
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
little bit on that could be on the
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
higher side there is a business reason
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
why people go organic and or do
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
traditional um I don't see that giving a
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
tax advantage over someone who can then
 
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
profit more from doing something uh
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
would be uh Fair across the board to all
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
Farmers I was just wondering your
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that yeah I I would um I
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
would think that by reducing the the
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
barrier for all farmers in other words
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the the cost is going to be the same for
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
anyone trying no matter the size of
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
their operation it would increase the
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
the the number of people engaged in
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
organic farming and because of that it
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
would increase the amount of organic
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
produ produce in the in the State and
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
probably lower the cost I would imagine
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
of that produce so um
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
if you know initially what it's going to
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
do is is you're going to have people
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
that are still charging a premium on it
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
and that's fine you're you're all that's
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to do is bring in more business uh
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know that that's going to actually
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
bring in more revenues so I don't see a
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
problem there and in the long run I
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
think that um what it will do is it will
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of organic food
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's available within our state and
 
02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
also at at your your your flea Mark not
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
flea markets but your farmers markets
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
and things like that if you're organic
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
certified and you're you're going to a
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
farmer market to to do your food you're
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're still competing with all the
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
people that are there so um I don't see
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
a problem with it but you know I I
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from on
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
not what is the cost of getting
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
organically certified and is it a
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
sliding some kind of a a scale so that
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
if you're a you know if you're a home
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
Gardener versus five acres versus a th
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
Acres uh is there a difference in terms
 
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
cost well it was my understanding and
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
the people that I talked to that it was
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and 800 some OD um when it was
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
being certified by the state and that
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
that cost went up to um a he it
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
basically just about doubled when for
 
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
doing it um with one of the non-state
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
certified certifiers that was my
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you thank you
 
02:14:29.639 --> 02:14:30.790 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you thank you
representative

02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
Oregon thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Foster um we're
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the direction of
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
legalizing marijuana or as we like to
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
call it cannabis um do you feel this and
 
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
of course uh tobacco is already uh legal
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
to grow um so you feel like does this
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
definition um do does this definition
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
give enough protection for uh home
 
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
owners and tenants who want to grow
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
either of those plants on their property
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
for their personal use or do you think
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
maybe might need to be tweaked of course
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just a subsid on the committee so
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
any like work sessions I probably won't
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
be at but you feel like those give
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
enough for for growing like those two
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
plants or other things that people might
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
might smoke or
 
02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
not what I smoke thank you very much for
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I really don't and the reason I don't
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
is in the bill itself um it is very very
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
clear that nothing in the in the the
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
subdivision um shall be construed to
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
it it basically is saying that it it it
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
cannot go uh contrary to existing law so
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
as long as those things aren't uh legal
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
to do right now you can't do them this
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
law doesn't change that but thank you
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
for your question all right thanks thank
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair end Murray thank you Mr
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you to the prime sponsor for
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question as well I am curious
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the intersection of
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
gardening homesteading and farm stands
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
and how the differences in those
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory arms if you will are
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
intersecting with one another on a
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
larger scale of organic food production
 
02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:16:31.429 --> 02:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
explain in what
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances the organic food
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
production certification process is
 
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
necessary is that necessary for a
 
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
Stand well it's it's it's really
 
02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
designed more for the smaller form
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
operation at least in my my thinking
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's designed more for smaller
 
02:16:51.319 --> 02:16:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's designed more for smaller
operations

02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and basically by getting that
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
certification they can sell their their
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
organic eggs or their organic milk to
 
02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:04.599 align:start position:0%
other packagers or other um food
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
processing places that are looking
 
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for organic for their their
 
02:17:11.309 --> 02:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
products um and it basically is just
 
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
opening up more avenues for those um
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
Farms to actually sell their products
 
02:17:22.509 --> 02:17:22.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Duty yes thank you
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question so if I
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
read this bill correctly it seems to me
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that it's really aimed at
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
smaller uh let's say smaller gardeners
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
or or a large scale Gardener but not
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily a farm for somebody who
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
wants to be organically certified to
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
maybe um uh have a home business and
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
sell at farmers markets is are those the
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of people that came to you and and
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
requested the spill yes because okay
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
so and and they're finding out that the
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
the cost the barriers to entry are too
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
high for them for their gardening
 
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
operation $1,000 for a certification
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
would be would be too high for what they
 
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
could produce is that basically what I'm
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
hearing that was the feedback I was
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
Foster seeing none we thank you sir for
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.309 --> 02:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
you next we have uh Rob Johnson from New
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
again morning again Mr chair members of
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the committee once again for the record
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
Rob Johnson representing the New
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau as a federation
 
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.990 align:start position:0%

02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
director we certainly support the intent
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor and we certainly support
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
our right to guard in New Hampshire no
 
02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.549 align:start position:0%
our right to guard in New Hampshire no
doubt

02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
um I just want to point out to you that
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
our state's uh Planning and Zoning
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
statutes relative to the authority of M
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities in RSA 674 col 32- C it's
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
under the agricultural uses of land
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
section already go we believe above and
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
beyond what this bill does and of quot
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
it it's the tilling of soil in the
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
growing of Harve excuse me I'll start
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
over again the the the tilling of soil
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
in the growing and harvesting of crops
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
and Horticultural Commodities as a
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
primary or accessory use shall not be
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited in any District period that's
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
been on the books of some time and it's
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
basically I would say it is our right to
 
02:19:43.950 --> 02:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
right to Garden uh statue you could say
 
02:19:46.030 --> 02:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
in many regards Rob what was that irsa
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
again 67 74 col 32- C 674 col 32- C
 
02:19:52.399 --> 02:19:55.950 align:start position:0%
again 67 74 col 32- C 674 col 32- C
thank

02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
you we're all we we're also concerned
 
02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
and and I'm saying we're we're speaking
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
in Oppo opposed to the bill though again
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
we we we we we very much support the
 
02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
intent of what what the obviously the
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative Foster is a supporter of
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
Agriculture no doubt
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to point out in the bill is
 
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
drafted I mean it could be
 
02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
read to say that it weakens current
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
statute and protections for agriculture
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
under four proposed uh 432 colum 38
 
02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.150 align:start position:0%
under four proposed uh 432 colum 38
section

02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
4 under a uh AB C and D you know where B
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
for example exempts uh it says that
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in the subdivision should be
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
construed to exempt any commercial
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural operators from existing
 
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
local state or federal law what
 
02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
agriculture we're already exempt from
 
02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
from many statutes I'll give you an
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
example is the Shor land protection act
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
provided agriculture follows best
 
02:20:55.150 --> 02:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
management practices so it weakens us
 
02:20:58.830 --> 02:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
right there under SE where it mentions
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
water use
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the currently municipalities can't
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
regulate water use I mean there are
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements that farmers have
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
above and beyond a certain threshold
 
02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
they they municipalities right now they
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
can regulate water use as far as uh uh
 
02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
watering Lawns is is where they where
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
they have the authority and then it goes
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
on next one is fertilizer use there's a
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
preemption statute on the books that
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
again protects Farmers for again
 
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
providing where they're using bmps and
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
then in D it gets see appears to allow a
 
02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners association to to regulate
 
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
which current under current law they
 
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't do so again I I hate to be up
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
here opposed to a bill when somebody is
 
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
supporting agriculture we just pointing
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
out the uh these items getting to the
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
second section relative to the the uh
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions and and and and uh such
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
um there currently under federal statute
 
02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
the USD organic program if if is again
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
the this is from what I heard was
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
designed to help smaller smaller Growers
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
the existing USDA program exempts uh you
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
can call yourself call your product
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
organic if you've got under $1,500 or
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
less uh in in gross sales you you still
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
have to abide by the USD regulations but
 
02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have go through the
 
02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:20.150 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have go through the
certification

02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
program USDA does provide cost share
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds if somebody would like wants to
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
convert there's a there's a cost share I
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
from what I understand it it depends on
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're doing but adds up to
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
a good 50% or more of the of the uh the
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
cost um and as far as the and
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby alluded to this
 
02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
earlier the with the the business
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
profits tax piece there there already
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
are exemptions on the books that are
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's in the neighborhood again
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
that 75 to 100,000 I know there was
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation last year in the budget that
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
increased that so again the intent to
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
help smaller Growers uh we just don't
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
see that this this would do
 
02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
that uh there were I try to address a
 
02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
couple of questions representative
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
Harrington you asked the question about
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana well as the the RSA 21 colum
 
02:23:12.590 --> 02:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
34- which which defines the agriculture
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
in the state I believe it's defined as
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
it it's there mentioned in it legal crop
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
so if it's not legal in the state it it
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know wouldn't uh obviously
 
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered um and and
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative did you ask a question
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
about the cost of Organic certification
 
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
and uh yes there was a recently the the
 
02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture uh this
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
past fall um notified uh Farmers that
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
they were no longer providing Organic
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
certification for what they what they
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
call processors or handlers or and for
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
um uh uh what was the other one there's
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
four sections there process handlers
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
wild and which we didn't have any in
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
livestock um so they they're not we had
 
02:24:03.309 --> 02:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
a dozen or so livestock um so they're
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
they're doing this for crops and those
 
02:24:08.269 --> 02:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
people and this is what the sponsor may
 
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
have heard those people are now required
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
to find a a uh another certifier and the
 
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture is the only
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
certifier in New Hampshire there's
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
certifiers in in MA in Maine Vermont and
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not State entities they're
 
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
private agencies that do it and and
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
there the the the or the organic uh
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
certification cost in New Hampshire it's
 
02:24:32.110 --> 02:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
set by Statute and it was number of
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
years ago when it was set so the cost
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
are for New Hampshire Growers using the
 
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture are quite a
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
bit less than what they are to use uh
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
certifiers in other states so there
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
there is that's what I think the sponsor
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
is saying there is is an increase there
 
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
and actually there's a bill that in
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's was introduced in the Senate that
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
looks to that and I think everybody from
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing is uh an agreement
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
that those costs are going to have to go
 
02:24:58.590 --> 02:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
up if the program is going to continue
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that's a piece of that and
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
just lastly I will was also mentioned
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
about existing Farm operations and
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
grandfathering and we have a New
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a right to farm law that's
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
been on the book since the mid 80s 1985
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
I believe that is I seen seen as one of
 
02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
the stronger ones in the nation it's one
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
was one of the first and again that
 
02:25:19.950 --> 02:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's RSA uh
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
432 uh 32 through 35 that's 432 column
 
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
32 through 35 and that is known as you
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
won't see the Words Right to Farm but
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
that is our right to farm
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
statue and I'd be happy to try to answer
 
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
questions as always thanks for your time
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
and attention thank you Mr Johnson any
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
Aron thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.870 align:start position:0%
Aron thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
Johnson

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:48.269 align:start position:0%
Johnson
and

02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
so the sponsor of the bill mentioned
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the reason why this bill was
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
thought of was because he saw other
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
states had various zoning laws and other
 
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
laws that were uh coming onto their
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
statutes that were prohibiting
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
farming and basically didn't want to
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
have that happen here and I just want to
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
confirm that your statement is that we
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
already have those Protections in place
 
02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
through RSA 674 colon 32- c as well as a
 
02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
right to farm bill RSA
 
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
432 uh 32
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
to35 is that correct I just wanted to
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
verify that that's correct I mean there
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
are always I should say always there are
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally challenges at the municipal
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
level but we do have we do have uh at
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
the state level good Protections in in
 
02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire what I'm saying is
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
basically that the the language that's
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill weakens our
 
02:26:57.389 --> 02:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
existing statute that's what it boils
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
down to okay thank you very
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
much any further questions for Mr
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
Johnson seeing none we thank you for
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
today that is the last pink card I have
 
02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
is there any uh further testimony that
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
anyone would like to give on this bill
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
seeing there's no one in the audience
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to guess that's
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
no I will uh read the blue sheet we have
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh one signed in in support on the blue
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
sheet and online we have 12 in support
 
02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
and one
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
opposed with that I will close the
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%

04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
our plants which support our animals
 
04:05:22.349 --> 04:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
that make up our food without
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
pollinators the natural cycle of life is
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
endangered and it follows that
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
pollinator friendly policies will
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately benefit our state especially
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
when implementation is very low
 
04:05:36.670 --> 04:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
cost Mr Gordon's idea was to Model A New
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based law
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
um from other states existing
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
legislation to create a pollinator
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
friendly standard promulgated for solar
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
fields in which owners whether Municipal
 
04:05:50.670 --> 04:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
residential commercial or otherwise of
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
these said Fields could voluntarily meet
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
a set of standards and then claim a
 
04:05:58.070 --> 04:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
one-time status that the field was
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
beneficial and pollinator friendly the
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
idea was that standards could be set
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
forth for a solar vegetation management
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
plan where Native PL
 
04:06:10.590 --> 04:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
could be planted beneath the ground
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
mounted solar fields to attract
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
pollinators and serve as foraging
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
habitats to
 
04:06:18.910 --> 04:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
birds amongst the pollinator benefits
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
these plans would help reduce heat
 
04:06:22.110 --> 04:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
beneath the structures thereby improving
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
their efficiency and improve the beauty
 
04:06:26.189 --> 04:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
of the fields for communities as opposed
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
to a grass field or a soling rock
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
covering underneath the solar
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
panels I agreed to help Mr Gordon with
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation which is how
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
this proposal is reached you initially
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of interest from New
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sa our pollinators Coalition
 
04:06:46.030 --> 04:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
but as you can see um from previous
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by the Department of
 
04:06:50.429 --> 04:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh last week that
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
we've had trouble bringing Dees on board
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the uh UNH extension
 
04:06:57.550 --> 04:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
professors with this
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
idea so there are pre three primary
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why I would be cutting this
 
04:07:05.229 --> 04:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
introduction short today uh with a
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation for
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
itl uh which I will just know I did
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
previously share with the
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
committee before so first I spoke with
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
UNH Professor Amy Papo who has expertise
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
in this field and she's co-created along
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
with another retired Professor unh's
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative extensions Master Gardener
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
program and a pollinator G Gardener
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
certification program these focus on
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
much smaller scale Gardens and as I
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
understand that Professor papan didn't
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
think this proposal was feasible given
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
that each Wildflower a native plant
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
garden tends to be extremely sight
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
specific um particularly you know what
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
is in the ground previous to the
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
cultivation um and that will also
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
dictate you know success of the the
 
04:07:52.479 --> 04:07:53.630 align:start position:0%
dictate you know success of the the
field

04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
itself she was also saying that it's
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
very uh difficult to cultivate and
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
maintain um what is in and underneath
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
the soil and she has concerns about
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
scaling up the size of a small backyard
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
garden to a large solar
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
field she is obviously cautious about
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
creating a scorecard with a set of
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
permanent guidelines because she really
 
04:08:16.510 --> 04:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
believes that working one-on-one with
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
certified pollinator experts are
 
04:08:21.389 --> 04:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
required to have a successful
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
field um and ultimately she did not
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommend the previous leg uh the
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation as an immediate
 
04:08:28.640 --> 04:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation as an immediate
step

04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
step
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
forward um second I spoke with um both
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
Mr peler of the dees and Phil trobridge
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
of the Land Management Bureau
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh which is the proposed governmental
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
body that we would propose um be charged
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
with publishing the ultimate
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
scorecard as I understand it U Mr trage
 
04:08:50.109 --> 04:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
had concerns about the Department's lack
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
of expertise in creating the scorecard
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
or even evaluating what would go in the
 
04:08:57.990 --> 04:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
scorecard um and then the long-term
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
expense in tracking the status of the
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
scorecard and owner's compliance I
 
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
explained that we were simply asking
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
Dees to public the scorecard after UNH
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
extension had co-created and endorsed um
 
04:09:12.800 --> 04:09:14.389 align:start position:0%
extension had co-created and endorsed um
our

04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
proposal and that we've identified the
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
dees for purposes of publishing that
 
04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
scorecard because it's where we believe
 
04:09:22.269 --> 04:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
owners of solar Fields needed to go to
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
get the required permits at the
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
outset I also explained that this law
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
would be designed where voluntary
 
04:09:28.479 --> 04:09:30.109 align:start position:0%
would be designed where voluntary
compliance

04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
04:09:32.670 --> 04:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
um and claims of beneficial ownership
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
status did not require the state to
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
track the
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
scorecard um for either their compliance
 
04:09:40.510 --> 04:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
in the field itself or you know whom is
 
04:09:40.520 --> 04:09:41.550 align:start position:0%
in the field itself or you know whom is
claiming

04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
claiming
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
it so um the idea is that it'd be very
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
low cost it's just a simple statutory
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
permissive compliance and people can
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
choose to you know cooperate and comply
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
to U Mr trobridge believes that the
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
department of fishing game would be a
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
better promogator of this scorecard and
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
um we have yet to coordinate with the
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
Department of fishing game so I'm not
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
prepared to offer an amendment at this
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.030 align:start position:0%
prepared to offer an amendment at this
time

04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:10:09.910 --> 04:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
third neither the Dartmouth student nor
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
I have expertise to cultivate this
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
proposed SC scorecard without UNH
 
04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
extensions advice and guidance so we
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
were at a loss of what to bring to you
 
04:10:22.590 --> 04:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
today which we understand is a critical
 
04:10:24.510 --> 04:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
part of our proposed
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislation um so it's clear um you know
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
even though there are models existing
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere that we would like to design
 
04:10:35.950 --> 04:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
one that's more you New Hampshire
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
specific um and so there's a little more
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
work to do there as well and I think
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
fourth um which I did not mention to you
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
in my previous correspondence that there
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
is um some language twe tweaking that
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be done the original proposal
 
04:10:50.040 --> 04:10:51.550 align:start position:0%
needs to be done the original proposal
submitted

04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
to uh the office of legislative Services
 
04:10:58.590 --> 04:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
was based on a Vermont text and um for
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason an alternative States
 
04:11:04.510 --> 04:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
text was chosen and proposed here um
 
04:11:07.469 --> 04:11:07.479 align:start position:0%
which I think it doesn't appear very
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
permissive and its um
 
04:11:12.630 --> 04:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
titling so there's some tweaking to do
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
there as well although we are obviously
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
we that there is similar legislation
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
existing in Vermont and feasibility
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
concerns have been addressed elsewhere
 
04:11:25.950 --> 04:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
in States across United States we
 
04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
realized obviously a lot more workers
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
needed to identify and bring along the
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
relevant stakehold
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
holders and to propose you know our
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
example scorecards there's a lot more
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
work there to do as well
 
04:11:40.389 --> 04:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
um this is why we're working to revamp
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
our proposal in the coming months and
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to resubmit an LSR in the
 
04:11:46.109 --> 04:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
coming year that
 
04:11:46.119 --> 04:11:47.710 align:start position:0%
coming year that
said

04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
um my belief is that we could be more
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
efficient and productive by bringing
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
that work offline um and that um
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding with an interim study is
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably not the best use of resources
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
at this time um but of course I will
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
look to the committee um for its
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
guidance on how they would like to
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
proceed and I'm here happy to answer any
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions that you might
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative so I guess
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'll just make sure that I'm clear is
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
your request of the committee you wouldd
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
like us to itl the bill at this
 
04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
time that was my proposal but I'm happy
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
to follow your guidance okay just wanted
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure I was clear on that thank
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
you any uh questions for representative
 
04:12:28.960 --> 04:12:30.309 align:start position:0%
you any uh questions for representative
hackin

04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
hackin
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah I know this bill will probably
 
04:12:39.750 --> 04:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
be it but my question in reading it is I
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
don't understand what the goal of
 
04:12:42.199 --> 04:12:44.309 align:start position:0%
don't understand what the goal of
certification

04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
is uh it's simply a PR beneficial status
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping it will help bring
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
other folks to the table in recognizing
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
that pollinator friendly fields are um
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
available to the state of New Hampshire
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
um you know for folks here to claim it's
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
status but to Pro to promote the
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
beautification of these spaces as well
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
so not only you know having more
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
awareness raised by it actually to make
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
these spaces more beautiful and more
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
know beneficial to our
 
04:13:21.429 --> 04:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
society follow sure um I'm on the
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
nashille Conservation Commission and we
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh had to make we made a favorable
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation regarding a solar uh
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
solar panels that were done in a in a
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
field near a uh a wetland buffer and one
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
of our stipulations ations was that they
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh create a pollinator field underneath
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
that and make it wildlife and pollinator
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
friendly I'm also part of the pollinator
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
Pathways organization and we're also the
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission is part of the
 
04:13:56.590 --> 04:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
the I think they call it the Wayside so
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a number of organizations
 
04:14:01.229 --> 04:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that promote uh
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
education around building pollinator
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
Gardens and being pollinator friendly so
 
04:14:09.990 --> 04:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
why not take an educational approach as
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
to you know what seems to be just a lot
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
of steps and a lot of bureaucracy for
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
something that is basically just
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
educational in um you know in its intent
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative I have not myself
 
04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
considered that in the past um but I
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
will be happy to share those comments
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the Dartmouth student who proposed
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
this idea and to see if we could
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
incorporate any of that moving forward
 
04:14:37.279 --> 04:14:38.109 align:start position:0%
incorporate any of that moving forward
thank

04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you Mr
 
04:14:43.630 --> 04:14:43.640 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question and thank
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this bill forward and
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um one
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
thing that I was curious of I understand
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
what your intent uh and proposal to the
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee is regarding um which
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
direction you would like to see the bill
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
but I was curious to know about whether
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
or not the
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
plantings that within the proposal are
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
they New Hampshire native plants or is
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
the there any sort of delineation around
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
that that would ensure that what is
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
being planted in these proposed Gardens
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
are native and non-invasive or any of
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
those types of things thank you
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative for the question um yes
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be short the long answer is it was
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
our intention to coordinate the listings
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
of what acceptable or eligible native
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
plants could be included in the actual
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
scorecard itself and we were looking to
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
UNH extension um for guidance on what
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know identifying which of those
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
plants would be most helpful and you
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
know maintaining its space um and
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
obviously pollinator friendly
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
so uh yes obviously that's part of the
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
work that would have not needed to go
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
into the scorecard and um know when we
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
initially met
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
with uh the UNH uh Professor about you
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
know our proposed idea we' we'd shown
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
her a previous scorecard that identifies
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
native plants in this particular
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
instance it was Vermont uh so similar
 
04:16:18.750 --> 04:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
but obviously different
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and um we did not get into the
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the details at that
 
04:16:26.030 --> 04:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
point because she was um not yet on
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
board with the general proposal so um
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
yes that is something for the future to
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
be worked out thanks thank you for
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
answering my
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
question representative Bixby yes thank
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh for taking my question
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
um what I'm wondering is why this needs
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
to be legislation as opposed to uh using
 
04:16:50.189 --> 04:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
existing avenues like uh Cooperative
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
Extension which has a very good rep
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
record for public education and uh and
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps other um other organizations
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
that uh are already working with the um
 
04:17:06.990 --> 04:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
sort of public education public science
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh citizen science and of things I'm I'm
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
not sure why this needs to be
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for your question
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh and I should say that I think the
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
best answer I can provide you at this
 
04:17:22.349 --> 04:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
time is that my understanding is that
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
small backyard gardens are the focus
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently at UNH extension uh these
 
04:17:27.760 --> 04:17:30.670 align:start position:0%
currently at UNH extension uh these
sized

04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
sized
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
um the size of these current
 
04:17:37.830 --> 04:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
program focuses are much smaller than
 
04:17:40.269 --> 04:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing um of course
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
coordinating with other organizations
 
04:17:44.429 --> 04:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
who are you know for instance like the
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission that I've just
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
learned about um know these solar
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
fields are much larger and they will
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
need a different set of focus um and
 
04:17:57.149 --> 04:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
different you know there's going to be
 
04:17:59.070 --> 04:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
different management plans for that
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
scale so I think it's a matter of
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
working out you know reaching out to
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders who may already have
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
more knowledge about this and I think
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
the educational benefits will come if if
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's something that is promulgated more
 
04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
widely across the state clearly there
 
04:18:16.109 --> 04:18:16.119 align:start position:0%
are many stakeholders at the table
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
already with their fingers in this
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
project at various scales we need to try
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
to give them a centralized program or
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
for instance this permissive legislation
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
that would you know really extend much
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
further than the small circular work
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that each of those organizations are
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
doing so that's the intent with our leg
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:38.429 align:start position:0%
doing so that's the intent with our leg
legislation

04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
04:18:47.469 --> 04:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
testimony so uh we have representative
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
um MC Williams from marac 27 but I guess
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
I will I will ask all of the remaining
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
folks who have put in cards where we
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
have a request from the main sponsor to
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
itl this bill I is it uh if you want to
 
04:19:07.469 --> 04:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
wave off testimony let the committee uh
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
discuss what uh has been offered we
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
would uh we'll accept that but it's up
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
to you if you'd like to testify we
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
certainly have a some time for you to do
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
that so welcome to the EA and go
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you chair Pearl uh for the
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Rebecca
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I represent the west side of
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
conquered and you are currently sitting
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
in my district so welcome to my area of
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
conquer um I'm a co-sponsor on this bill
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
and I think my take is slightly
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
different than the sponsors take so I
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
think it's it's worth putting it on the
 
04:19:41.550 --> 04:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
record um so uh I would say that we have
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
heard from all kinds of interested
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
interested parties about this bill and I
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
think this bill has potential legs um I
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
think there's something that we could do
 
04:19:50.279 --> 04:19:51.070 align:start position:0%
think there's something that we could do
here

04:19:51.070 --> 04:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislatively um so I would respectfully
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
disagree slightly on whether this does
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
or does not need to be legislation I
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
believe this does need to be legislation
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you why I think this
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be legislation um basically we
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
have a nent but growing solar industry
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right so more and more
 
04:20:11.790 --> 04:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
companies are coming in and offering
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
solar panels and people who own large
 
04:20:15.550 --> 04:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
tracts of land are seeing the value in
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
either doing a ground lease or
 
04:20:19.469 --> 04:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
potentially selling and doing solar it's
 
04:20:19.479 --> 04:20:20.830 align:start position:0%
potentially selling and doing solar it's
happening

04:20:20.830 --> 04:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
slowly if we leave this to the market
 
04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
what will happen is these developers
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
will do the cheapest alternative
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
underneath the panels so on a smaller
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
scale that may mean gravel or wood
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
chips on a mid-range scale that might
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
mean using fossil fuels to mow grass
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
underneath the panels and on a large
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
scale that might actually mean removing
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
the entire top soil from a several Acre
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
Site and bringing in some other medium
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's easier to maintain so we as the
 
04:20:53.590 --> 04:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
state have the ability to set some
 
04:20:55.710 --> 04:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
parameters and rules for what happens in
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
these large scale solar developments and
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases small scale solar
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
developments but leaving it to the
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
market means that the cheapest possible
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
alternative is likely what will happen
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that is not necessar necessarily a
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
good thing for the environment of New
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so as the legislature I
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
would remind you that we have the
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
ability to set some parameters and
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
thresholds for what these developers do
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
on a solar site when they're developing
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so um obviously uh
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips has
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
already talked about our issues with
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
pollinators in New Hampshire this is
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
reaching a crisis point we know there's
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
a problem we have less bees every year I
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to tell you guys this you've
 
04:21:36.750 --> 04:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
heard this your your Ena um but big
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
picture um I think that there's an
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
ability to do some studying on this bill
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's studied offline that's great
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
um but I think this bill does need to
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
come back in some form to talk about
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
either capping or setting separate
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for acreage for solar
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
developments in New Hampshire and what
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
that looks like that's best for the New
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire environment um so I do think
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
that we should take a heavy hand with
 
04:22:02.109 --> 04:22:02.119 align:start position:0%
this and not just make it an optional
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
opt-in scorecard program I think we
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
should have some serious parameters for
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
the score card and I think we should
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
make this something that's required
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're not going to see
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
what we want to see for these Open
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
Spaces that Encompass large swats of
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
acreage across the state so I'm happy to
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you representative
 
04:22:21.720 --> 04:22:25.109 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you representative
any

04:22:25.109 --> 04:22:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none we thank
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
you next up we have Phil tro
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.550 --> 04:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
Ena thank you chairman Pearl and members
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee can you hear me okay or
 
04:22:55.389 --> 04:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
should I okay okay um I I thank you for
 
04:22:56.830 --> 04:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify I'll keep
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
this brief um we support the
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation to itl this bill um the
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
department had several concerns um and
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know some of which have already been
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
covered related to duplicating effort
 
04:23:13.870 --> 04:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
with with UNH Cooperative Extension the
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
one part that hasn't been mentioned yet
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
today is that the Department's main role
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
with these solar sites is in storm water
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
management on the on those sites and so
 
04:23:24.670 --> 04:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
we would want to make sure whatever
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
proposal comes forward is consistent
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
with that uh I think Native vegetation
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
pollinator friendly vegetation could be
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with that we want to make
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
sure that it is um when we did a we
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of expertise in this
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
area when we did some preliminary
 
04:23:43.510 --> 04:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
research um some of the recommendations
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
were needing to strip down soil and and
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
put down some plastic barriers which
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
would increase erosion and that would go
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we were trying to do
 
04:23:55.389 --> 04:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
through our permitting of these sites so
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's definitely ways to make these
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
two things work together I support we
 
04:24:01.070 --> 04:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
support the goal and the intent uh we
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
just think it uh needs some further
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
study thank you thank you you any
 
04:24:08.429 --> 04:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr tro representative
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh so um in do uh at the ele
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
school where my kids went uh at UNH did
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
a project installing rain Gardens to um
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
slow the the uh runoff of uh rainwater
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
particularly from the building roof into
 
04:24:32.349 --> 04:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
a relatively sensitive uh local Brook
 
04:24:35.469 --> 04:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if uh something in
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:24:40.189 --> 04:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
of uh rainwater management Gardens might
 
04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
be something that would be workable in
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
the future as as if someone want was
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
trying to continue this
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislation yes thank you representer
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby um I think the answer is a
 
04:24:55.109 --> 04:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
qualified yes and it it all depends on
 
04:24:57.790 --> 04:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
the scale we deal with some of these
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
solar Farms are 100 acres and so a a
 
04:25:04.349 --> 04:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
rain Garden would be quickly overwhelmed
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
um with the amount of runoff from such a
 
04:25:10.710 --> 04:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
site so we often have to have uh quite
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
sophisticated storm Water Management
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
Systems just to handle that to make sure
 
04:25:16.109 --> 04:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
we're keeping the soil on the site but a
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
smaller site a rain Garden could work or
 
04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
a distributed a distributed system of
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
rain Gardens could work um but it it's
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
when we are permitting these things
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting engineered
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
plans uh to to C that show how the storm
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
water is going to be captured and
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
managed and uh it can be uh fairly
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
complicated thank you than
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
you any further questions representative
 
04:25:44.189 --> 04:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
Mason thank you for taking my question
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here today
 
04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
question I have is pretty simple you
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
spoke about 100 Acre Parcels being used
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
for these projects um is there a seed
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
available that is a native seed for New
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that people can purchase and
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
and and plant that with a native seed
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
crop I don't know of any place that
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
manufactures that has that
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
available um thank you representative
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
Mason uh there is a seed mix that is
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
supported by New Hampshire fishing game
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
and it it it may be better to call it

the absence of invasive species seed
 
04:26:24.670 --> 04:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
than um a a you know purely native
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
vegetation but when we permit these
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
facilities we do require the use of the
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
seaing mix that does not introduce
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
invasive species thank
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%

1517 creating a pollinator pollinator
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
solar scorecard the Department of
 
04:27:45.309 --> 04:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources division
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
of forest and lands we take no position
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill but we wanted to offer
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
these following
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
comments so the division of forest and
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
lands as most of you know is one of the
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
five divisions under the Department of
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources and
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
within that division the natural
 
04:28:02.189 --> 04:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau responsibilities include
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
collecting and analyzing data on the
 
04:28:06.189 --> 04:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
status location and distri distribution
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
of native plant species and natural
 
04:28:10.590 --> 04:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
communities to develop and Implement
 
04:28:13.109 --> 04:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
measures for the protection conservation
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
enhancement and management of native New
 
04:28:14.800 --> 04:28:17.670 align:start position:0%
enhancement and management of native New
Hampshire

04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
plants as many of you know again native
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
plants support a diverse food web due to
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
a long history of interacting and
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
evolving with Native Wildlife most
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
native insects evolve to be Specialists
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
on native plants therefore we suggest
 
04:28:32.109 --> 04:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
amending the proposed language in
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
section 362
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
f161 uh a to also include other Wildlife
 
04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
that benefit from native
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
plantings I I'm I'm GNA offer very
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
specific amended language changes but I
 
04:28:47.469 --> 04:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
realize way ahead of the curve here
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
since it's the sponsor is asked it to be
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
itl so I've submitted my testimony to
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
you I don't know that it's productive
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
right now for me to go through the two
 
04:28:57.870 --> 04:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
or three amendments we're suggesting but
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
I did want to let let um the committee
 
04:29:01.469 --> 04:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
know that the division of forest and
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
lands natural heritage Bureau is very
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the sponsor to
 
04:29:08.990 --> 04:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
refine it one one last point I will say
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
is there's been a question of expertise
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
as far as how to advise the sponsors on
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
how this scorecard can be developed and
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
I would like to just uh give a plug for
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
our staff at our division so the natural
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau and our colleagues at
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
the uh non-game and endangered species
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
program at fish and game department uh
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
those two agencies would really be a
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
good source of technical guidance for
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsors going
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%

04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
people whether it be the John Deere
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
dealership or the hatchland da which is
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
a large uh dairy in this state or it be
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
growing apples we we have it all right
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
there in um in U havil as you do many
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state here so I'd
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
like to address 1584 which is
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
established as a capital Improvement
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
grant program for benefit of state fairs
 
04:34:52.590 --> 04:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
and agricultural fairs uh throughout our
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
state and to start off
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
with uh the the issue of state fairs in
 
04:35:03.070 --> 04:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
our in our state uh we've had state
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
fairs it's been a way of life for going
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
back to when my my grandfather came here
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
back in the 1700s a direct grandfather
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
in haal New Hampshire from haal
 
04:35:18.189 --> 04:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Newberry Port um but
 
04:35:20.429 --> 04:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
we have been as a past in the state here
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the commissioner will be
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
able to address even a little bit more
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
that back in
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
1989 we had funds that came from the
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
paramutual pools there at Rockingham
 
04:35:35.470 --> 04:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
which money came annually to state fairs
 
04:35:38.590 --> 04:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
in our state back in that year it was
 
04:35:38.600 --> 04:35:40.590 align:start position:0%
in our state back in that year it was
$145,500

04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
$145,500
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
and it's it's G it's grown to $150,000
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
then down to $50,000 and stopped in 1979
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
or thereabouts at around
 
04:35:54.429 --> 04:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
$275,000 now the the North havil Fair
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
which I'm very familiar with because
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's just in my own backyard is a fair
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
which uh attracts folks from all over
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
New England as does hopkington fair and
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of the others which at times can
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
attract as many as 70,000 per uh people
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
during the course of that fair and when
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
I came across and back to I'd taken the
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
grandkids over to look at Saratoga and
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%

04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
back through Vermont and when I came to
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
the visitor center there in Vermont this
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%

going I'm going to the north North hail
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
fair I said guess where I live uh right
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
there only a little bit I live in havil
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of towns within our
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
village districts within havil from Pike
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
to North havil to havil to Woodsville
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
Etc but any rate we used to get that
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
funding and I I leave the committee this
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
I had research do a research on it this
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
goes back over the years on state fairs
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
and how the it was done by Anna Bickford
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
who is a researcher there in in the
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
office so I'll leave that for for your
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
records so Madam clerk you won't have to
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
do any um writing on that
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
part but there have been some recent uh
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
research here this is about 10 years old
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
done by Plymouth State
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
University um I was just up again
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
talking with Don Burks who's the
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
president of Plymouth State last night
 
04:37:25.949 --> 04:37:25.959 align:start position:0%
at 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock and we talked
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
a little bit about fairs and how they
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
feel that that's an integral part of our
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
our lifestyle up there but back then in
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
in um they started started in 2002
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
they've gone all the way through 2011
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
they said what what is the income that
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
comes from these state fairs here in the
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it's over
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
$4.6 million annually some from the
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
state fairs but it's dwindling it's
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
dropping off and we got to be cognizant
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
of that and try to address the report
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
stated agricultural fairs in New
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generated 97 jobs 27.4 million
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
in household income and $7.1 million in
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
state local government receipts this was
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is about 10 years ago when PSU did
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
these surveys they haven't done it since
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
but that information was available back
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
then now we're dealing with a situation
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
where the life and fairs is really
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
changing it's changing in terms of the
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
need for having Capital facilities
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
buildings and three-phase power and all
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
that coming in and that's adding costs
 
04:38:34.590 --> 04:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
you have to have uh many utilities and
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
and and various services for uh visitors
 
04:38:41.230 --> 04:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
available and that's required by Dees
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
and many of the organizations which
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
assess this in hail our state fair does
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
generate a sizable honk of dollars and
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
one thing they try to do up there is
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
that because they are a nonprofit they
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
do not um they don't have to pay their
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
taxes but they do pay property taxes up
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
there because they're trying to make
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the local taxpayers don't get
 
04:39:08.349 --> 04:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
caught with the bill for for the fair
 
04:39:11.629 --> 04:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
and um the fair is set up and this bill
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
that you have before you defines who's
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for a capital Improvement Grant
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
and in order to be eligible to receive
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
grant money that we are proposing that
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 be contributed to a grant fund
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
to support Capital Improvements be it
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
the roof be it the the toilets be it
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
whatever in in this you had to be member
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association Affairs
 
04:39:37.199 --> 04:39:38.628 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association Affairs
and

04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
expositions I I don't know the exact
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
number it's probably around 14 or so
 
04:39:46.350 --> 04:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
right now and you have to promote
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and the B and you have to uh
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
develop uh support economic rule
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
Economic Development and support the
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
youth that through 4 and and Future
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
Farmers of America and you have to have
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
those types of elements which contribute
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
to Agriculture and the way of life and I
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
I believe the fair at at at at North
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
havil does that of course I I know
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's some maple syrup Growers here
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at one and uh we do have the
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
museum and all the paraphernalia goes
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
with it but we don't have the facility
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
for it we it's it's sitting outside and
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
rusting and we do have a maple serup
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
Museum in fact uh the commissioner and I
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
went through that this just this year
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
but we need some help and and all these
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
fairs need help right now and to
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
maintain this way of life to maintain
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire is there there this
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%

eligible to receive a grant according to
 
04:40:54.390 --> 04:40:54.400 align:start position:0%

they maintained their buildings in a way
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they should be maintained for the
 
04:42:44.190 --> 04:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
last 20 years we also make sure that
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
there's an effort to uh from the
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
community to support the the grant that
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
they're receiving the same should occur
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
here there has to be an effort to
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
maintain and not let things just go go
 
04:42:56.360 --> 04:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
maintain and not let things just go go
to

04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
heck um the overall condition and
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
appearance of the grounds and Facilities
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
is also looked at which is is really
 
04:43:04.120 --> 04:43:05.868 align:start position:0%
is also looked at which is is really
important

04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:43:10.110 --> 04:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
um grants are on a competitive basis uh
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
the department shall develop and manage
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate contracts with the selected
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh applicants monitor pro project
 
04:43:19.628 --> 04:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
expenditures and grantee performance and
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a process that's outlaid in
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill here on the health or safety C
 
04:43:26.190 --> 04:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh or C safety Capital Improvements
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
and contract
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
requirements so I won't take much more
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
time on this we see it as as uh vital uh
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
and a good way to vital for Community
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
growth vital for agriculture in our
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
state and a way to maintain and continue
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
what we have in the state I've worked
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
with the fair Association they're very
 
04:43:49.390 --> 04:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of this of course they would
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
be but they are but and I've also Lo
 
04:43:55.390 --> 04:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
worked with the 4 and and those that are
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
in FFA up in our our NEC Woods um in
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
havil and I I believe that this is uh
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
not a great deal of money we're talking
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
about here a capital Improvement fund of
 
04:44:11.310 --> 04:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
$250,000 of which grants that go out 5%
 
04:44:13.390 --> 04:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
would be remaining for the commissioner
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
use in administrative purposes um the
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
remainder would go to the you know
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
districts as on a merit basis based upon
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
how the commission decides they should
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
go there's a lot a latitude in this bill
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the commission of Agriculture and
 
04:44:30.190 --> 04:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
marketing so in conclusion I would like
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
to you know just uh maybe hand the Baton
 
04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
off to others that are more
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about agriculture I'm not
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
I I plant my own garden every year but
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
that's about the extent of it nothing
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
comes out of the ground I
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
have uh you know a lot of weeds so and I
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
do go out there periodically every every
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
so often to try and Chase the dog and
 
04:44:53.550 --> 04:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
various animals out of it but doesn't
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
never work so thank you very much for
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity it's always a pleasure
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
to come to agriculture it's uh I'm
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
surprised you don't have some food for
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
us here
 
04:45:06.670 --> 04:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative first we can
 
04:45:10.510 --> 04:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.230 --> 04:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
farming only one question that I have is
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
there is there language in here that
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
caps an individual project as to the
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
portion of that
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
$250,000 I I didn't see it but it may be
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
there I I can't you know quite
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
truthfully I haven't looked at it since
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
I put this together with the farming
 
04:45:30.670 --> 04:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
Folks up there uh I can't recall
 
04:45:30.680 --> 04:45:32.310 align:start position:0%
Folks up there uh I can't recall
um

04:45:32.310 --> 04:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:35.310 --> 04:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh contributed contribute matching funds
 
04:45:37.470 --> 04:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
and are kind there's a yeah there's a
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that they also match some
 
04:45:42.670 --> 04:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
money 15% but I don't recall seeing what
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're addressing this it's something
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
that you know I don't think people would
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
be objecting to I I I do believe if you
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
talk to Sean Jasper about that U there
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
may have been a provision when that's
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
been done in the past sure I I'll save
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that question for the Commissioners as
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
well any other questions for
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative lab we'll start around
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
repes com
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
question um just to you're asking for
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
$250,000 out of the general fund um we
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
have just instituted historic uh horse
 
04:46:21.150 --> 04:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
racing and chable gaming in the state in
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
the last few years why are we not
 
04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
tapping into uh those funds as opposed
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
to adding additional funds from in from
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
the general I in response to that when I
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
when we put this together we re
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
recognized $250,000 is about what we
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to start we didn't want to shoot
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
moon I was really relying upon Ways and
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
Means to figure out where how this money
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
would be appropriated and and and I I
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
think that's where I still am on that I
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
didn't get into whether we're going to
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
deal with horse racing or some other way
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
of doing this which is you know
 
04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
Rockingham is just not not a source
 
04:47:03.150 --> 04:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
anymore and you know I know I've had a
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
number of bills just Rec recently with
 
04:47:06.430 --> 04:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
15 early bills and a lot of them are all
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
asking for more money and there again
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll send it on to nor major and let
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
him figure it
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
out uh representative Murray thank you
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for taking my question and
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you to the sponsor for bringing
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
the bill forward I do have a question
 
04:47:24.990 --> 04:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
sort of in line with representative cona
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
and maybe um you can answer is the
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement grant program where
 
04:47:34.548 --> 04:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
the monies will be deposited non-aps so
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
that this could be in years forward used
 
04:47:42.590 --> 04:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
it yes it is and that that's the intent
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill that the money you
 
04:47:48.830 --> 04:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
know if you're re if you receive a grant
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
that has to be expended within a
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
two-year time frame that's that's I
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
believe in the bill as far as yes the
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
money's non-aps it's just like our our
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
fund which we have for infrastructure
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
money for
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
schools thank you
 
04:48:05.680 --> 04:48:06.830 align:start position:0%
schools thank you
representative

04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
hola yes thank you for taking my
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
question uh you if I heard you correctly
 
04:48:14.590 --> 04:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that there was a grant
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
program prior or there were money monies
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
prior and I was just wondering if you
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
know the time frame of when those were
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
and what kind of financials were
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
involved with that and and why that
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
stopped when that stopped I believe was
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
1979 but in
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
1979 I was living in Alaska so I can't
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
really get give you that uh the
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
historian amongst us right now is your
 
04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner standing by you know his
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
family comes believe it or not we're
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
related and and uh I'm very proud of
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
that uh and uh but the paramutual I I I
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
gave you that that information and which
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it with you that was which
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
was done by research and that goes
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
through how those monies from rocking
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
ham have been used during the short
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
period of time that that
 
04:49:04.548 --> 04:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
existed can I follow on uh yes sir thank
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
you for the follow on question to follow
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
on to that if if those monies were if
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
the fairs have existed since
 
04:49:18.190 --> 04:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
1979 without additional funding um
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
besides the is it just the
 
04:49:22.990 --> 04:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is dated 1979 and now it
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
needs to get
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
replaced what's the justification for
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know 50 years later to to now start
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
that program back up I I think we're
 
04:49:34.990 --> 04:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
getting the point where the fairs have
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
tried based upon revenues that come in
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
from gate that a a fair cannot survive
 
04:49:42.548 --> 04:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
just alone on those four or five days
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
when the fair is open at their for their
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
big Fair a lot of the grounds are used
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
like in north haval right now if you
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
were to go up there and look at all the
 
04:49:52.990 --> 04:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
facilities we have cars which being put
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
in them while people are in Florida we
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
have storage in them we're making money
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
that way there's there's various uh
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
travel groups that come and setup shop
 
04:50:07.310 --> 04:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
there um so that that type of Revenue
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
has always the the revenue that comes in
 
04:50:12.190 --> 04:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
from other than during fairgate and what
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
you have to pay out to exhibitors and
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
what you get from
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
that that is not enough to sustain the
 
04:50:20.190 --> 04:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
North havil Fair alone we have to have
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
sources coming in from the other months
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
and we're working very diligently to try
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
and find ways to do that now what's
 
04:50:31.868 --> 04:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
happening is that with the cost of
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining we have put new roofs on the
 
04:50:36.750 --> 04:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
buildings new sighting on the buildings
 
04:50:39.868 --> 04:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
um and we're trying to keep up however
 
04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
the the washrooms for example the
 
04:50:45.548 --> 04:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
bathrooms they need some work and we're
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
at the point now that there there just
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
isn't the money there and it's a way of
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
life that's going to slide from us very
 
04:50:57.070 --> 04:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
quickly fairs are really part of this
 
04:51:00.030 --> 04:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
state and I'd like to see that history
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
continue and with the the funds which
 
04:51:05.788 --> 04:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
would come from a grant and with the
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
local having to put in 15% or so in kind
 
04:51:11.548 --> 04:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it's through Labor or
 
04:51:13.708 --> 04:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
through something such as that I think
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to really um address some
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
of those issues for example bringing
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
three-phase power into the North havil
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
Fair has been extremely extremely costly
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to have that in the
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
operation of the fair you know 20 30
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
years ago but now we do with all the
 
04:51:34.510 --> 04:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
campers that come in and and and Park so
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
those are the type of what this time is
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
asking us this year and the recent years
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
have required us to do to stay in
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
business so I hope I answered it
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh you did okay you did if I
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
could check have one more one more one
 
04:51:54.510 --> 04:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
um you said there's a cost share of 15%
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
for the community yes is there a reason
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
why that cost is is so modest because I
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
know you know when you're talking
 
04:52:04.030 --> 04:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
certain federal grants it's usually a 2
 
04:52:07.548 --> 04:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
575 is there a reason why that 15 well
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
in looking at $250,000 and splitting
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
amongst all the state fairs are those
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
that are prioritized by the
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office um when you look
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
at 15% 15% in terms of North haal Fair
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
Association is a lot of money uh this is
 
04:52:28.990 --> 04:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm coming forward with the request
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
for there be a capital pool available
 
04:52:33.150 --> 04:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
for us to help out with some of that
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:52:37.708 --> 04:52:37.718 align:start position:0%
um the hail continues to pay the taxes
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the property too fair not the town's
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
people so we're not pushing that burden
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
off I guess they could try to do that
 
04:52:46.590 --> 04:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
and get a tax exemption from the select
 
04:52:50.350 --> 04:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
board as some fairs may do however it's
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh something that you're just
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to pay for all
 
04:52:56.670 --> 04:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
that and and it's the feeling of the
 
04:52:58.270 --> 04:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
people up there that they'd rather do it
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
and the 15% they can get that that could
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
be you know that could be modified it's
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
not necess putting up 15 thou 15% in
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
cash it could be in kind I know that
 
04:53:09.390 --> 04:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
when we got a grant from the federal
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
government to fix the covered bridge
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
going across the Connecticut River up
 
04:53:16.110 --> 04:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
there we matched that through bringing
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
in time and effort from our town so that
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
was already budgeted for the in our town
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
manager in some of the equipment we use
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
so it was inine type contribution the
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
county does that as well you're welcome
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you for
 
04:53:34.350 --> 04:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um thank you again
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
for taking another question so with
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
regard to the in-kind matching I'm aware
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that does exist as you mentioned
 
04:53:42.310 --> 04:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
but I was curious to know I think it is
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
enumerated on line 23 of page two um for
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
your purposes who is monitoring the
 
04:53:52.868 --> 04:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
value of those inine Services is that
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
enumerated in rules or like how would
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be that's right we I we
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get down into the weeds as far as
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
getting there however we did give stat
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
Authority for to not stat rulemaking
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
authority to the commissioner so when
 
04:54:11.070 --> 04:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
the application comes in how
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
accountability how to say that that is
 
04:54:15.548 --> 04:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
an in kind that we're going to accept or
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
not accept that would be up to uh
 
04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and marketing to make that
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know and go to Jael car and and sell
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
their product okay thank you very much
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my call sorry
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
to be behind you a bit here um I love
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
state fairs I've been to the Iowan and
 
04:54:41.788 --> 04:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
saw the butter cow I grew up in Kentucky
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
huge fair but I've always been a little
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
confused because there technically isn't
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire state fair by deao I
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
guess it's the hopkington state fair oh
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
it's north Harville Fair okay well that
 
04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
gets to my point aren't I and I'm mean
 
04:55:00.510 --> 04:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
no offense but I had never heard of the
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
haal fair to say that all of the these
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
Regional fairs are de facto state
 
04:55:11.070 --> 04:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
fairs um I'm not sure everyone would
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
agree with that and wouldn't it make
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
more sense for regional fairs to be run
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
by say the County cooperative or the
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
communities I I I just on that question
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
right there I I'll default to the
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner but uh the
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
Grafton County for example is the only
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
County left that is uh State Farm or
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
County Farm an active County Farm which
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
has produce which we use to provide
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
produce for the nursing home we use it
 
04:55:51.868 --> 04:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
you know for people in need within the
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
community and it's also helps uh uh
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
substi some of the costs at the
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
corrections facility by providing food
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
there as well um so the county up there
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
is very involved with
 
04:56:09.070 --> 04:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and um I there is the state
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
fair Association and and I guess that's
 
04:56:13.548 --> 04:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
the closest thing we can get to as a
 
04:56:16.830 --> 04:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
state type operation even though that's
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
not it's a
 
04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um I as far as getting into
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms and the governance and
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
all that I think it's wise to put that
 
04:56:27.390 --> 04:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
forward to the commissioner and find out
 
04:56:28.548 --> 04:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
a little bit about where we've been in
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
the history why we don't have a state
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
fair um North ail fair I'm surprised you
 
04:56:38.190 --> 04:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of it it's uh a wonderful
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
Fair uh it really is it's it's got all
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
the rides it's got all the you know
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
activity for young kids even if you like
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
bumping cars apart and all that but it
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
also has the oxen and the horses and the
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
sheep and and and and we we give Awards
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's in a commissioner's award as you
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
know in other fairs the commissioner
 
04:56:58.750 --> 04:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
also gives award out to the best exhibit
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of Agriculture and that's done
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
in havil as well um it's the big deal at
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
the end of July every year up that way
 
04:57:10.030 --> 04:57:10.040 align:start position:0%

Perez thank you for uhu giving me the
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask this question and
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
question to you this build sounds
 
04:57:28.548 --> 04:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
amazing but um we not Tak in
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
consideration festivals and uh all homes
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah and and I just wonder um if
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's the intention to add them or just
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
U talking about uh
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
fairs so I I didn't quite get the
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
question could you say it again please
 
04:57:51.390 --> 04:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because I'm on the other side
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's do hangy here yes my question is
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
because the bill sounds really
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
interesting and and and good but we're
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
not including festivals for example uh
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
in my my my area we have the Pumpkin
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
Festival which is a big deal and and
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's other festivals in keen and
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
festivals in other areas and then we
 
04:58:16.110 --> 04:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
have the old home days in in certain
 
04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
areas in in New Hampshire and I just
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
wonder uh these
 
04:58:25.150 --> 04:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
Bill uh intentionally not putting those
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
into consideration as well well we have
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
the old home days over in Warren that's
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
just on the other side of moose loock
 
04:58:34.510 --> 04:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
from us and it's part of the region we
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
do have the pumpkin farm up there that's
 
04:58:39.070 --> 04:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
Grafton County and we bring all the kids
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
out of school and they all go down there
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the grade school and pick their
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
pumpkins every year um there's a lot of
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
associated activities that go along with
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
the fair up there the fair is an
 
04:58:51.150 --> 04:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
integral part of the culture and the way
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
way any other questions uh excuse me
 
04:58:59.600 --> 04:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
way any other questions uh excuse me
representative

04:59:01.270 --> 04:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so as I I
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
understand it um these all these fairs
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state are local
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
supported and so would would this bill
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
enable the state to participate in a
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
more active manner to come under the
 
04:59:21.070 --> 04:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella of
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
sponsorship and thereby kind of make it
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
more of a state recognized uh operation
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
activity uh tradition I think it's
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
important that the state be involved
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
with these these fairs um it is New
 
04:59:38.910 --> 04:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where jobs it's a lot of job
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money that comes from
 
04:59:45.868 --> 04:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
these um the state involvement is good
 
04:59:47.708 --> 04:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
as long as the state doesn't try to
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
start telling them how to do it um I'm
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'm a local control guy um so but I I I
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
think that in terms of supporting some
 
04:59:58.750 --> 04:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the organizations like our youth
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
organizations the 4ers and the FFA
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's an educ ation and and what we're
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do up there right now is that
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
we are trying to develop more
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity through our
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
fairs for the schools and we're tying in
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
the just like you have the Agriculture
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
and the schools um committee which is a
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
group that is not made up of legislators
 
05:00:26.470 --> 05:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
or senators or Representatives made up
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
of various associations in a state ver
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
that are vested in
 
05:00:33.868 --> 05:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
agriculture and we have that bill in
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
front of us um this year so I I think
 
05:00:40.270 --> 05:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
that for the state to be involved that's
 
05:00:43.390 --> 05:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
important um we look at recreation in
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
our state which is powerful agriculture
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
is especially some of the uh smaller
 
05:00:50.910 --> 05:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
Farms the the innovative ways they're
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
getting involved with by local we've had
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
several bills today just we've dealt in
 
05:00:58.470 --> 05:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
downstairs which have dealt with uh food
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
in our schools meals in our school
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
lunches etc represent Oregon is aware of
 
05:01:02.718 --> 05:01:03.910 align:start position:0%
lunches etc represent Oregon is aware of
that

05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
and and um we are looking at trying to
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
figure out ways that the produce and
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
growing of of crops locally can be used
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
within our schools like using that milk
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
that comes out of hatchin dairy and
 
05:01:20.548 --> 05:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
rather than taking it from a large Co-op
 
05:01:22.110 --> 05:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
that takes it out to New York State and
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
does it all out there and then ships it
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
back let's give the guys a little break
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
here in our own
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
State it's it's going to be good for our
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
economic future and just for Main
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining our rural sense of
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
life thank you any other
 
05:01:41.788 --> 05:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we appreciate your
 
05:01:45.310 --> 05:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll look to commissioner Jasper to
 
05:01:47.470 --> 05:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps shed a little more light on some
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
of these
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
topics I have some materials here should
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
I just give them to the clerk so them in
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%

to be on but never got assigned to
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%

05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
so I am here in in full support of this
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%

05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
the Association of Fairs last year
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
asking how we could could help I try to
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
get to every Fair every year can't
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
always make
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
everyone um so I'm well aware of their
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
their needs and their struggles I
 
05:03:07.708 --> 05:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
generally meet with u members of their
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
board board of directors when I'm there
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the the uh the managers of the fairs
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
you heard about how much um activity
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
there is monetarily the fairs bring in
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not a lot of that money
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
actually goes to the fair associations
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
they go to the vendors and the people
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
who pay a relatively modest fee to to be
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
there a relatively modest gate
 
05:03:33.628 --> 05:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
attendance there's that issue issue of
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
when do you go up too much and and
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
people stay
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
away I I want to first before I forget
 
05:03:42.430 --> 05:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the issue that question that
 
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
was asked about festivals in Old home
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
days I am not aware of any of them that
 
05:03:50.548 --> 05:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
have Capital needs those generally just
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
set up um on a field or within
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
city-owned land or something for a
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
period of time they go away there's no
 
05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
footprint this is for the capital needs
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and so the history and
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative lad covered it pretty
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
well my my distant cousin um covered it
 
05:04:13.750 --> 05:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
pretty well but it it it was an
 
05:04:16.030 --> 05:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
interesting story because when uh
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham asked to have Races they had
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
to pay paramutual to the state and then
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
they wanted to expand the number of
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
racing days and there was a state
 
05:04:31.470 --> 05:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
senator it was he was the deciding vote
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
essentially in the Senate
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
and so he came up with the scheme to
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
allow them to
 
05:04:41.390 --> 05:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
expand that got a took a quarter of
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
one% of their uh premiums essentially
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and put them to the state
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
fairs for um paying premiums to the to
 
05:04:55.948 --> 05:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
the people who came in and exhibited um
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
showed animals and and whatnot so
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
anything that the fairs paid out in
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
monetary prizes most of that money came
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham Park and so that number
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
that number grew over the years and
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
eventually Rockingham went into into
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
Decline and the the num the money went
 
05:05:19.470 --> 05:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
away that was really how we lost the uh
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
the Plymouth State Fair is they had not
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
really they didn't see it coming and
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't adapt and then suddenly the
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
money from the state went away and they
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have um the ability to pay the
 
05:05:35.070 --> 05:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
premiums that they had been most of the
 
05:05:39.070 --> 05:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
fairs were able to um pivot a bit and
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
and change their model um we've lost a
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
couple of fairs since those those days I
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
think the number is at 11 right now um
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
stratum just will probably not be coming
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
back number of factors with that and
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
there was another one that tried to
 
05:06:00.430 --> 05:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
start up an eeping that is also um
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
closed down so
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
the issue of of capital investment is is
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
really very important particularly if
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
you were to go to um a fair like rooch
 
05:06:15.868 --> 05:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
Rochester um which has been on the brink
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
for years they've got some big old
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
buildings they've got some benefactors
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
who help but their agricultural
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
buildings are primarily gone they very
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
much want to get back into that business
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
and start attracting more people there
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
they simply don't have the wherewith
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
with all I can tell you that in in many
 
05:06:36.990 --> 05:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
cases now the fire departments are
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
putting a very heavy burden on the on
 
05:06:42.548 --> 05:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
the fairs uh in terms of fire safety
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
where before it was okay you know it's
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
50 feet to a door people are going to
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
get out there's never been an accident
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
but now oh you have to have this
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
particular system that may cost you you
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
know 100 or 200,000 to put in in some of
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
these these cases so there's a lot of a
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
lot of issues there there are aging U
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
buildings and well what did they do over
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
the last you know 50 years well I I'll
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
tell you you know I'm a member of the
 
05:07:16.548 --> 05:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
Hudson Historical Society I was the
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
first and I think I'm still the only
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
Junior member that the Historical
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
Society has ever had I still sit on the
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
board of directors and I'm still one of
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
the youngest members who participating
 
05:07:32.430 --> 05:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
in historical society a and that is
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much true of all the
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that I belong
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
to there are very few organizations that
 
05:07:41.708 --> 05:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
have the younger members who now have
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
the Physical Agility and the energy to
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
say well I'm going to go roof that
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
building myself you know and that's what
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
used to happen 50 years ago it was
 
05:07:52.350 --> 05:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to get a group of of people
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
who were young enough and agile enough
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
to do that maintenance now you're in
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
many cases looking at the same people
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
who've been running those fairs for for
 
05:08:07.150 --> 05:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
30 40 years you know obviously
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
deerfield's one that we're pretty much
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
all familiar with how long has Junior
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
Gardner been doing those
 
05:08:17.548 --> 05:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
ads you know it's still Junior Gardner
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
out there I think I was in my teens the
 
05:08:24.030 --> 05:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
first time I heard Junior Gardner doing
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
those ads and I think that pretty much
 
05:08:28.590 --> 05:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
tells you the story of of what's going
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
on um with with everything in in the
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
state um and so they do need need the
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
help they are very very important to New
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you asked a question Mr
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
chairman about limit and I don't think
 
05:08:46.670 --> 05:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
there should be because when you look at
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 it's not a lot of money for
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of these um projects and if we were
 
05:08:56.110 --> 05:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
to say well you can only get you know
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
25,000 we'd probably see more buildings
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
being torn down because they just
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't could couldn't get there there
 
05:09:09.110 --> 05:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
are um occasions um where Cornish just
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
put in a beautiful livestock Pavilion
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know they worked very hard and got a
 
05:09:17.430 --> 05:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot of local businesses to to help and
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's great and that's what we would
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage but then I look
 
05:09:23.430 --> 05:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
around at the fairs and see those those
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
that can't and see the things that need
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
to be done and if we have facilities
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
that aren't up to par people are going
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
to start to go elsewhere they're going
 
05:09:35.708 --> 05:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
to say okay look at how Vermont's fairs
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
are are supported and they do support
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
them look at Maine you know and people
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
are going to start to drift away and the
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
Situation's going to get get much worse
 
05:09:47.788 --> 05:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I you know as as to
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
your question of the general fund I
 
05:09:51.868 --> 05:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
don't know where the the money from the
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
historic racing or anything else is
 
05:09:56.830 --> 05:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
going uh I think that representative lad
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
hit on that that's a decision for ways
 
05:10:01.390 --> 05:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
and means to me it's all one pocket of
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
money really because you take it from
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
one place it's not available you know in
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
another so but um I I Look to Ways and
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
Means where I'm sure this would go or
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
Finance to decide um if if the general
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
fund is the appropriate place I
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
certainly hope we do support this um and
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is different than what was done
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
because before it was the prize money
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and I will tell you the prize in
 
05:10:29.070 --> 05:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
money needs to be increased to the
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
people who are are showing animals
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
because it's more and more expensive for
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
them this will take some of the pressure
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
off but it will guarantee that we get
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
something in return because it will
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
improve the facilities directly instead
 
05:10:45.150 --> 05:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
of just giving the money there it will
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
allow for an adjust adjustment and I I
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
think there are fairs that may apply and
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get any money because they're
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
doing very well and others that um would
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
get more because of the difficulties uh
 
05:11:01.708 --> 05:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
they've had every every fair is
 
05:11:01.718 --> 05:11:02.750 align:start position:0%
they've had every every fair is
different

05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
as to why they're called state fairs you
 
05:11:07.830 --> 05:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
got me on that that's just the
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
traditional uh name we call them state
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
fairs hopkington just put that in its
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
name it's got nothing to do with its
 
05:11:18.310 --> 05:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state they've all
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
been considered I think state fairs
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
because they occur within the state of
 
05:11:22.600 --> 05:11:23.350 align:start position:0%
because they occur within the state of
New

05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but if we ever had a a
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
state sponsored fair I'm actually not
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
aware of it but so I think that's a
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
distinction without a without a
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
difference and you if you look into the
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
actual definition although the title is
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
state fairs Capital Improvements act the
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
ne definition of a fair has nothing to
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
do with State Fair so I don't think
 
05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's anything that requires to be
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
changed because that's just the title of
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
the chapter that um was was put in place
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
by legislative services so I'll be glad
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any question that I can
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
and if I miss some that were
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
um um asked and I've forgotten that's I
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
just turned 63 on Sunday so it's just
 
05:12:10.558 --> 05:12:11.868 align:start position:0%
just turned 63 on Sunday so it's just
old

05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
old
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
age well yes happy birthday so just for
 
05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the committee this is an
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
early bill I don't know what it second
 
05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee assignment is but my
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
assumption it would be either Finance or
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
Ways and
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
Means uh representative
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you for taking my question
 
05:12:30.430 --> 05:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here as being an
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
exhibitor over the past 20 years years I
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
have seen the decline of a lot of these
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
fairs um and I have also been the
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
culprit of going elsewhere because prize
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
money for the animals that we put a lot
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
of money into has uh not been what it
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
once was you mentioned how Rockingham
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
paid in was that a part of the original
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
fund that ended up disappearing or what
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
happened to the original fund that was
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
part of all it was an annual
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation as I said it was a is a
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
quarter of 1% of what they paid to the
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
state so as the revenues declin and then
 
05:13:08.590 --> 05:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
Rockingham eventually closed I'm not
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
sure if it if the legislature changed it
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
after 79 or or not because I the fair
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
the uh racing occurred there for many
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
years afterward so I I didn't look at
 
05:13:24.750 --> 05:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
the history of that but it obviously um
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
went away at some point and rather the
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislature just said oh wait a minute
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting too much money as
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative lad said they were
 
05:13:31.440 --> 05:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
representative lad said they were
getting

05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
275,000 all went towards premiums at
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
that point in the legislature might have
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
might have said well that's a lot of
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
money but it started out by by the time
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
they went to night racing which is when
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the monies really went up um yeah that
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
150 was a lot of money in the 40s and I
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
think it was the very early 40s or the
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
late 30s when the whole scheme started I
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
did write a market bullettin column
 
05:13:59.910 --> 05:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
about that couple of years ago and I
 
05:14:00.990 --> 05:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
should have brought that with me but I
 
05:14:01.000 --> 05:14:03.350 align:start position:0%
should have brought that with me but I
forgot

05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
forgot
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
any other question representative
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:14:09.390 --> 05:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
question property and liability
 
05:14:14.670 --> 05:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
insurance is a big load on many
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
businesses and Enterprises and private
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
and even charitable organizations and
 
05:14:22.830 --> 05:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's climbing what extent does Property
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and Casualty have on the fairs that
 
05:14:29.670 --> 05:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I I don't have any
 
05:14:32.390 --> 05:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
um firsthand knowledge of the premiums
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're paying but I thank you
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative because that was
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
something I did intend to mention was
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
that in fact you know the liability
 
05:14:43.948 --> 05:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
insurance is definitely climbed I know
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know in my business and in anything
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'm involved with it's a big ex expense
 
05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
and particularly when you're dealing now
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
with with animals and even though I'm
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
sure the all the uh companies that run
 
05:14:59.948 --> 05:14:59.958 align:start position:0%
the midways are insured you can't escape
 
05:15:02.350 --> 05:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
that liability if it's on your your
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
property so I'm sure they have to have
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
coverage for that but but all of those
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
things add up and this is the problem
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
they're all adding they're all adding up
 
05:15:14.590 --> 05:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
and they're adding up on an aging um
 
05:15:16.510 --> 05:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
group of people and that was one of the
 
05:15:20.110 --> 05:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
factors in stratom they were all aging
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
out the town did some things that hurt
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it just there wasn't the wherewithal
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
to continue and I really we worry that
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
when we look at some of some of the the
 
05:15:32.590 --> 05:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
buildings on some of these fairs if we
 
05:15:34.990 --> 05:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
don't provide some help these people are
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to become overwhelmed and just
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
throw in the towel and they're there are
 
05:15:42.548 --> 05:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
too few people coming up along I mean I
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
worry about that in everything that we
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
do in in agriculture and the other thing
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
I meant to me mention is that these
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
these fairs are really no different than
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
farming they're dependent on the
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
weather and when the weather is bad
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
their revenues go down and and they have
 
05:16:00.430 --> 05:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
expenses that continue throughout the
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
year and so if they have a bad year
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
because it rained consecutively on the
 
05:16:08.190 --> 05:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
weekends on the gate attendance was down
 
05:16:10.110 --> 05:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
where's the money going to come from
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to come from building
 
05:16:14.110 --> 05:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance facility maintenance and it
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
just continues a cycle I'm not surprised
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of people here today
 
05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
because I'm having a hard time keeping
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
up with the schedule of the bills that
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
I'm um trying to keep track of I'm sure
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
many of the fair associations weren't
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
aware of them and frankly they're all
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
volunteers um so please don't take the
 
05:16:39.628 --> 05:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
fact that there aren't throngs of people
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
here from the fairs that uh don't take
 
05:16:45.788 --> 05:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
that to mean that um that they don't
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
care they do they met with me they asked
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
for help and and probably if anything
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I I'll put a little blame on my my
 
05:16:55.150 --> 05:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
cousin and take some myself that we
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
probably didn't do the Outreach that we
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
should have because he's busy running a
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
a a department I'm a running a committee
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm busy running a department and
 
05:17:05.948 --> 05:17:05.958 align:start position:0%
and things are things are crazy I just
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't think they knew that this hearing
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
was taking place today represent
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you Mr chairman for
 
05:17:14.670 --> 05:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you to the
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner sorry I am thank you for
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder um and this
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
is just I I'm curious to know what your
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on the balance that might
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
result um that would could or should be
 
05:17:32.350 --> 05:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
with regard to what port portion goes to
 
05:17:34.350 --> 05:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
building maintenance code compliance all
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
of these other types of things alongside
 
05:17:38.110 --> 05:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that you mentioned like
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
prize funding Etc well I I a capital
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
expense is going to be a thing like a
 
05:17:47.230 --> 05:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
fire alarm not a premium Capital could
 
05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
be repaving a section of Ro roadway um
 
05:17:52.990 --> 05:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
building a new building potentially
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
repairing what they have but it would
 
05:17:57.788 --> 05:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
all be related to the agricultural
 
05:18:02.830 --> 05:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
portion of the fair so not to to some of
 
05:18:05.190 --> 05:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
the other the exhibitor buildings that
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
that may be showing some of the other
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
things what my focus would be on is
 
05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that the components relating
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
to agriculture were improved but they
 
05:18:16.510 --> 05:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be something that had a I
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
think the bill says a life of at least
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
20 years follow up if I may sure one
 
05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um so to that end then so it
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
is you would take this on a per
 
05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
applicant basis for the request correct
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's in if I may that's
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
why I think it's important that it be a
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
revolving fund because there may be
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
years when it's going to be important to
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
let that fund build up knowing that
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
there are things coming up that may
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
total more than that and some years well
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that that's critical but
 
05:18:49.708 --> 05:18:49.718 align:start position:0%
you can see into the future that there
 
05:18:51.910 --> 05:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
are going to be be things
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
250,000 in buildings don't doesn't go
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
very far but it's going to be a huge
 
05:18:56.558 --> 05:18:59.190 align:start position:0%
very far but it's going to be a huge
help

05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
repola yes thank you thank you thank you
 
05:19:04.030 --> 05:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
sir for taking my question um you had
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned sort of the the Aging
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
committees that are running these um if
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
I understand this
 
05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
correctly um as I know that this goes
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
towards the Capital Improvements is
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
there a concern that even if this money
 
05:19:22.270 --> 05:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
is allocated that on the on the regional
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
and town end they may not have the
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
manpower to even say
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
oversee that fair is that a concern
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
well as I as I just told you it was a
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
concern in in
 
05:19:39.070 --> 05:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
stratum um you know there are people out
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
there who are often willing to help but
 
05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the time that folks used to
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
and so if they know all right I don't
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
have to do the fundraising I don't have
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
to do the actual construction I'm
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
hopeful that this would encourage people
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
to to take a uh a more active role you
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
know we've had a societ
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and probably in most of
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
the country where people were very
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
Hands-On they got involved in in
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
something I mean I jacked up the shed at
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
the Historical Society and poured you
 
05:20:16.628 --> 05:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
know footings under it yeah and I don't
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
see myself doing that anymore and
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
there's nobody coming along to do that
 
05:20:23.070 --> 05:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
but if I knew there was you know the
 
05:20:25.948 --> 05:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
money for that to be done I wouldn't
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
mind being part of the planning process
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
and so I'm more hopeful that that that
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
happens and and Hope hopefully um while
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
we may not have people involved as much
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the 20s and 30s that when they get
 
05:20:37.200 --> 05:20:38.628 align:start position:0%
in the 20s and 30s that when they get
towards

05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
towards
 
05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
retirement they'll be more willing to
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
take part in something that has a a
 
05:20:44.590 --> 05:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
revenue stream where they don't feel
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to do the physical
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
work thank you it's only a hope but it's
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
all I can do and I know hope is not a
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
plan any further
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
questions yes rep excuse me repi thank
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question and
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
I will apologize Upfront for this
 
05:21:09.628 --> 05:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
question okay and and that is you know
 
05:21:11.868 --> 05:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
you're coming to us to ask for
 
05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
$250,000 out of the general fund and two
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
years ago uh we were looking at a bill
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
to fund the uh animal abuse fund and we
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
were looking for 50 cents a year
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the dog fees and my
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues um voted that down
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
because it was a tax okay so if we
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't allocate 50 cents a year um to
 
05:21:42.430 --> 05:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
the increase in the dog fees um because
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's a tax why should I now which I
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
would like to support but why should I
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
now support a bill taking
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
$250,000 out of the general
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
fund that's an excellent excellent
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
question and I'll probably get myself in
 
05:22:00.320 --> 05:22:01.948 align:start position:0%
question and I'll probably get myself in
trouble

05:22:01.948 --> 05:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
but the general fund doesn't have a
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
constituency dog owners have a
 
05:22:09.868 --> 05:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
constituency snowmobile owners have a
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
constituency and and I remember the bill
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about but there
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
are always going to be people from those
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
constituencies saying I don't want to
 
05:22:22.270 --> 05:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
you know pay more money for that for
 
05:22:24.510 --> 05:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the snowmobiles I bring
 
05:22:29.150 --> 05:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
up because that was a particular fee
 
05:22:32.110 --> 05:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
increase that the snowmobile users
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to pay so that the
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
trails could be improved the legislature
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
still said no because unfortunately we
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
have groups out there that are scoring
 
05:22:46.510 --> 05:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
legislators and saying no more fees no
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
more taxes and you get a ding next to
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
your name if you vote for an increased
 
05:22:55.990 --> 05:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
fee or tax and so even in those cases
 
05:23:00.030 --> 05:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
where the constituents want the increase
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's somebody out there doing a score
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be scored by anybody
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
for 20 you know
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
50,000,000 so this is more likely to be
 
05:23:14.590 --> 05:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
a case where if um ways or means or
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
finances yeah we can do this then people
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
should be good with I mean there's
 
05:23:23.230 --> 05:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
always going to be people I I I've said
 
05:23:25.350 --> 05:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
get myself in trouble again that there
 
05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
are are probably people in the
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislature who don't want to spend any
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
money on anything and so there'll always
 
05:23:32.798 --> 05:23:33.868 align:start position:0%
money on anything and so there'll always
be

05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:23:36.990 --> 05:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
opposition but um I think this is one of
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
those hopefully wholesome things where
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
people know that if we lose our fairs we
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
lose an important part of who we are as
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
a state we lose an important part of our
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
Our Heritage and for something that
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't amount to 25 cents a person a
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
year uh in you know it's less than 20
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
cents per person I think that that's one
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
of those things that and I and I get it
 
05:24:07.390 --> 05:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
there's 10,000 things out there
 
05:24:10.350 --> 05:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
everybody can say the same thing too uh
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
and and so I understand that and I I
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
understand the decision that you have to
 
05:24:17.070 --> 05:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
make but hopefully as the environment
 
05:24:17.080 --> 05:24:18.510 align:start position:0%
make but hopefully as the environment
agricultural

05:24:18.510 --> 05:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee you can see that this is an
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
important part of of Agriculture and who
 
05:24:25.868 --> 05:24:25.878 align:start position:0%
we are as a
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
state any further
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions see none we thank you for your

05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:25:47.390 --> 05:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay we've got about six or seven
 
05:25:51.070 --> 05:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
minutes before the next hearing so I'm
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
session and we're going to open up the
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
exact session on House Bill 10:49
 
05:26:20.430 --> 05:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
amendments give a minute for the uh
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to actually take a motion
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
on this and get a second second and
 
05:26:32.350 --> 05:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
while these are being passed out and
 
05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
then I can start explaining uh what our
 
05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
process is here so I am going to uh I'm
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
going to move House Bill 1049 ought to
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
second I didn't catch who it was who
 
05:26:55.628 --> 05:26:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay so what we've done as as you
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
all remember we have a uh we had several
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
bills that were of similar topic that we
 
05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
heard last
 
05:27:08.548 --> 05:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I apologize I got to switch
 
05:27:10.350 --> 05:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
sheets here oh there it is that's the
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
for so we uh in our various caucuses
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
discussed a path forward with this and
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
we decided that we would move a lot of
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
the bills specifically the content of
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
1111 the content of House Bill
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
1121 and the content of House Bill
 
05:27:37.390 --> 05:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
1454 and combine that into house bill
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
1049 and so the amendment that I've
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
passed around which we haven't approved
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
yet but I'm just kind of giving you a um
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
an idea of how we're approaching this
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
contains all of the uh all of the
 
05:27:52.670 --> 05:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
criteria uh excuse me all of the active
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
parts of those bills and adds them to
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the part of House Bill 1049 so that
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
that all becomes part part of the study
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bixby uh spent
 
05:28:05.070 --> 05:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of time over the weekend in
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
putting this language
 
05:28:09.510 --> 05:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
together and so I want to
 
05:28:13.548 --> 05:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
offer to the committee the amendment to
 
05:28:16.350 --> 05:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
house bill for 1049 which
 
05:28:20.190 --> 05:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
is the uh oh actually we have to take a
 
05:28:22.830 --> 05:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
vote on OTP and then we we we actually
 
05:28:24.990 --> 05:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take a vote on OTP okay that's
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
right oh we we should we need to do the
 
05:28:29.708 --> 05:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
motion to amend you want me to do that I
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
always get that back backwards okay so
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look to uh representative
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually I'm going to make a motion to
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
move house the amendment to House Bill
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
1049 Amendment
 
05:28:46.270 --> 05:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
2022-23 I'll look for representative
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
Biby for a second um I will second that
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and would you like me to speak
 
05:28:52.910 --> 05:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
to it sure I think I've given somewhat
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
of an oversight on it already and I'll
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
turn it over to you to continue on okay
 
05:29:00.910 --> 05:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
so um the amendment essentially places
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
the um existing uh duties of the
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
committee the first two elements are uh
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as were in the um the
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh and then we've added
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
that to that uh section three which is
 
05:29:21.868 --> 05:29:21.878 align:start position:0%
looking at uh the uh maturity bonding of
 
05:29:23.788 --> 05:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
landfills to ensure that there's a
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
capacity to um pay for potential damages
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
and uh what particularly needs to be
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
studied there is a clarification of uh
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
how damages would be determined and who
 
05:29:37.628 --> 05:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
would uh and who would be eligible to
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
seek compensation for damages uh that's
 
05:29:42.030 --> 05:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh so that's something that
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
needs a needs study you both in terms of
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
is that something that we need that uh
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
we should have require of landfills as
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
the new landfills and the mechanisms for
 
05:29:59.548 --> 05:29:59.558 align:start position:0%
doing it if we uh if that if we decide
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
that's important thing to do
 
05:30:06.788 --> 05:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
um uh the next uh section is the content
 
05:30:11.310 --> 05:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
of uh uh dealing with the content of HB
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
1154 uh which is changing the setback
 
05:30:19.868 --> 05:30:19.878 align:start position:0%
for uh the um for a landfill from a
 
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
water water body uh which is currently
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
defined as 200 feet which is sort of an
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number uh this would look into
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh looking at iological characteristics
 
05:30:34.470 --> 05:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
of the site as a way of determining what
 
05:30:37.868 --> 05:30:37.878 align:start position:0%
that setback should be based on how fast
 
05:30:42.070 --> 05:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
a um contaminant might travel uh if it
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
if there is a a breach uh and so that
 
05:30:48.510 --> 05:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
would essentially um looking at how to
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
do a more science-based uh assessment of
 
05:30:54.270 --> 05:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
that uh we are also going to be not
 
05:30:55.948 --> 05:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
executing that bill right away but
 
05:30:58.510 --> 05:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
potentially seeing if we can amend amend
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
it before the deadline uh which would
 
05:31:02.510 --> 05:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
then make this part of the study less
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
important but uh if we if we can't come
 
05:31:09.670 --> 05:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
up with a resolution before the deadline
 
05:31:12.190 --> 05:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh then we can we'll still have this
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee this part of the study
 
05:31:17.230 --> 05:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
available to uh cover that um the next
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
section is uh the question of extended
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility which is a
 
05:31:25.868 --> 05:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
fairly broad concept uh and uh it exists
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
in some uh in some forms already uh
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are uh re so when you get a when
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
you um buy a new car battery you return
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
your car battery that is a form of
 
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility um the uh similarly with
 
05:31:46.750 --> 05:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
tires there are some states that already
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
have programs for electronics uh like
 
05:31:52.670 --> 05:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
computers and television screens uh New
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have one of those we
 
05:31:57.150 --> 05:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
can look at those States and see how
 
05:31:59.310 --> 05:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
they are doing that uh and there are a
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
couple of states that have looked at uh
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
that that are moving towards doing a
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
similar thing similar um program with
 
05:32:10.350 --> 05:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
packaging and a number of Canadian
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
provinces are doing that as well we can
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
look we can study those laws and see if
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
those laws would be uh something that we
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
could adapt to New Hampshire and um and
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
all of the benefit of all of those
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
things would be reducing the pressure on
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
our landfills which is costing us in uh
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
what we pay in our M Municipal Taxes for
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh tipping fees uh transfer disposal Etc
 
05:32:39.040 --> 05:32:40.750 align:start position:0%
uh tipping fees uh transfer disposal Etc
so

05:32:40.750 --> 05:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh this basically fits in with also
 
05:32:46.670 --> 05:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
with the that initial the section number
 
05:32:48.510 --> 05:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
two in terms of reducing pressure on
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
landfills one of the things that I think
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
is really important in terms of uh doing
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
any sort of extended producer
 
05:32:58.990 --> 05:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility is making sure that it
 
05:33:02.430 --> 05:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
really fits Within in how we do how our
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire solid waste system works
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of our system of uh local
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
transfer stations local recycling
 
05:33:16.350 --> 05:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
centers that uh and so if in order to
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
make it work in New Hampshire we need to
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
study how it works how it will work with
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire system already uh if
 
05:33:26.708 --> 05:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh trying to take a bill from another
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
state and just graft it onto our laws
 
05:33:31.110 --> 05:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
probably won't work work so this is
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to take us a fair amount of um you
 
05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
know fair amount of uh work and and
 
05:33:40.510 --> 05:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
research uh the last piece on here is uh
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
probably the least important piece
 
05:33:47.310 --> 05:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
because uh HB 1134 the bill dealing with
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
wipes uh we are going to uh deal with
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
that later today and hopefully pass it
 
05:33:56.670 --> 05:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
with Amendment so that it can go to
 
05:33:58.830 --> 05:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
resources as a second committee and they
 
05:34:00.510 --> 05:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
can figure out what to really do with it
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%

11 186 relative to companion animals
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
during a declared state of emergency and
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
I will call on rep Gallagher from
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
conquered Ward six to come in and
 
05:39:16.110 --> 05:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
good hi so I'm representative Eric
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
Gallagher from uh Mar County district 15
 
05:39:28.350 --> 05:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
which is conquered w six so I have this
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill on
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
pet evacuations um so you if you pay
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
attention to the news much
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
um you know there there's often lots of
 
05:39:47.070 --> 05:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
natural disasters being reported um and
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
even in my Committee just yesterday my U
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
my own committee Municipal and County
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
government we were hearing about
 
05:39:55.548 --> 05:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
flooding in um
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
aworth um and when there's something
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
like a blood people need to be evacuated
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
and one thing I've heard about is that
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes when people get evacuated they
 
05:40:13.150 --> 05:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
get separated from their pets and
 
05:40:13.160 --> 05:40:15.150 align:start position:0%
get separated from their pets and
they'll

05:40:15.150 --> 05:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
and that is not good for either the
 
05:40:22.510 --> 05:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
people or the pets
 
05:40:26.788 --> 05:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
um so in the aftermath of in the
 
05:40:31.468 --> 05:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina uh the
 
05:40:31.478 --> 05:40:32.590 align:start position:0%
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina uh the
federal

05:40:32.590 --> 05:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
government passed the pets act um the
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
pet evacuation and transportation
 
05:40:43.788 --> 05:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
standards act I think is um what it
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
stood for um so that was a bipartisan
 
05:40:51.788 --> 05:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
bill um setting up standards for how
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
exactly pets would be evacuated in the
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
case of emergencies but it had some
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
holes in it uh um
 
05:41:05.708 --> 05:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
so um that applies pretty much just to
 
05:41:05.718 --> 05:41:07.070 align:start position:0%
so um that applies pretty much just to
FEMA

05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
FEMA
 
05:41:09.990 --> 05:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
shelters um but the thing is sometimes
 
05:41:13.708 --> 05:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
people when being evacuated from an
 
05:41:16.350 --> 05:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
emergency uh get sheltered in other
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
places so this bill is intended to close
 
05:41:24.510 --> 05:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
some of the loopholes in the pets act
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
um such as when people get sheltered in
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
a hotel for instance
 
05:41:32.080 --> 05:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
a hotel for instance
um

05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:34.000 --> 05:41:38.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:41:38.190 --> 05:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
um so the language here
 
05:41:41.958 --> 05:41:43.708 align:start position:0%
um so the language here
um

05:41:43.708 --> 05:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
so says uh during a declared state of
 
05:41:49.548 --> 05:41:49.558 align:start position:0%
emergency containing an evacuation order
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
any hotel or Community shelter which is
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
required to shelter evacuated persons
 
05:41:56.910 --> 05:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
shall also shelter a companion animal
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
belonging to such evacuated persons so
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's the text as it reads um there's
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
also an
 
05:42:07.548 --> 05:42:07.558 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which uh the uh drafting
 
05:42:12.270 --> 05:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
attorney that OS should have or um I
 
05:42:14.430 --> 05:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
mean I I got the email for I think you
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
all were CC on it too um So after
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
talking with some people about this bill
 
05:42:26.310 --> 05:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
um some concerns that were raised um
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
were so where it says hotel or Community
 
05:42:29.400 --> 05:42:30.590 align:start position:0%
were so where it says hotel or Community
Shelter

05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
Shelter
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hotel uh some of the people I talked to
 
05:42:37.628 --> 05:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
were fine with but um there's a concern
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that Community shelter was a little bit
 
05:42:44.468 --> 05:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
vague as to what exactly that might
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
apply to so um I tried
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
to I tried to come up with an
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
amendment um to clarify that a bit but
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately um that
 
05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
part did make it in um the idea is
 
05:43:07.708 --> 05:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
basically that it should only be places
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
and shelter um places used as shelters
 
05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
where like it's possible for the people
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
and their pets to have their own
 
05:43:18.130 --> 05:43:18.140 align:start position:0%
separate rooms so like if it's a
 
05:43:18.140 --> 05:43:19.230 align:start position:0%
separate rooms so like if it's a
[Music]

05:43:19.230 --> 05:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:43:23.070 --> 05:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
school if if it's a school auditorium or
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
a sports Stadium or something where
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
everyone would just be in a big common
 
05:43:29.708 --> 05:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
area that probably wouldn't be the best
 
05:43:29.718 --> 05:43:31.270 align:start position:0%
area that probably wouldn't be the best
idea

05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
um but the thing is it's hard to come up
 
05:43:38.350 --> 05:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
with a term that um besides Community
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
shelters that draws that sort of
 
05:43:44.350 --> 05:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
Distinction um so what the amendment
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
does actually do um so the DHHS um it
 
05:43:53.070 --> 05:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
has this program called the disaster
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
animal response team which has kind of
 
05:43:58.628 --> 05:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
been kicked around from Department to
 
05:43:58.638 --> 05:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
been kicked around from Department to
Department

05:44:01.030 --> 05:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.030 --> 05:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
um which is kind of why I'm confused as
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
to why this bill is before this
 
05:44:09.270 --> 05:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
committee rather than uh before the
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee but
 
05:44:13.390 --> 05:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a question for the clerk
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
um but anyways um the disaster animal
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
response team needs some help getting
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
set up and one of the things they raised
 
05:44:25.948 --> 05:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
was how uh they enlist the help of
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers to help
 
05:44:30.670 --> 05:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
people uh
 
05:44:33.510 --> 05:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
evacuate animals in the case of
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
emergencies so
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
um but state law is kind of unclear
 
05:44:45.070 --> 05:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
about how exactly to treat
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
um treat these volunteers when they're
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
doing this so um my what my Amendment
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
does is it adds a definition of to
 
05:45:00.070 --> 05:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
Define these volunteers
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
as um
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
emergency as emergency workers so
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
they're created the same as other
 
05:45:07.478 --> 05:45:08.670 align:start position:0%
they're created the same as other
emergency

05:45:08.670 --> 05:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
05:45:08.680 --> 05:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
emergency
workers

05:45:10.230 --> 05:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
um so yeah the the idea is basically to
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
help get this disaster animal response
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
team and DHHS set up and going so it can
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
actually help rescue or help Pro
 
05:45:30.110 --> 05:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
properly keep people P people and their
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
pets together during emergency
 
05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
evacuation so that's the bill and the
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'll take any
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative so we
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
have not seen copies of the amendment um
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay would so we right now we're kind of
 
05:45:49.708 --> 05:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
working from the original Bill itself
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can well that's all
 
05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
right probably the best thing you could
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
do is we we'll sort of continue on uh
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
it's I think we all have a general
 
05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
understanding of the amendment language
 
05:46:01.868 --> 05:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
from what you've described but if you
 
05:46:04.510 --> 05:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
could provide that to the committee as
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps after the hearing here when you
 
05:46:08.230 --> 05:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
get a chance would be good or email us
 
05:46:11.070 --> 05:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
the copy that you do have would be
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
helpful any questions for rep Galler yes
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative amola yes thank you for
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I was just curious
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
about how the process works now during
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
an evacuation would would the companion
 
05:46:27.910 --> 05:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh animal be boarded somehow left behind
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
at the house what what what exactly
 
05:46:31.468 --> 05:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
happens right
 
05:46:31.478 --> 05:46:33.230 align:start position:0%
happens right
now

05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:46:33.240 --> 05:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
now
um

05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
so well if they're if they're brought to
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
a FEMA shelter then they're kept
 
05:46:41.878 --> 05:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
a FEMA shelter then they're kept
together

05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:46:43.600 --> 05:46:45.350 align:start position:0%
together
um

05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:52.350 --> 05:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
if um if it's not a FEMA shelter then um
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
I Heard uh that DHHS has some sort of
 
05:47:01.750 --> 05:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
trailer specific specifically for this
 
05:47:01.760 --> 05:47:03.390 align:start position:0%
trailer specific specifically for this
purpose

05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that they put the animals into
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
um but anyways um yeah in in the case of
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hurricane Katrina with the original pets
 
05:47:18.230 --> 05:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
you did actually hear about um pets
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
getting left
 
05:47:24.190 --> 05:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
behind but um okay thank you could I
 
05:47:26.030 --> 05:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
have a follow follow up sure uh the
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
question I had is in here if I'm reading
 
05:47:30.110 --> 05:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
this under understandingly it says a
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
companion animal there's no sort of
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
limit on what that definition is did
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
your Amendment address that in any way
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
because I mean it could be a companion
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
llama a companion dog I is there any
 
05:47:44.590 --> 05:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
kind of cap to
 
05:47:44.600 --> 05:47:47.590 align:start position:0%
kind of cap to
that

05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:50.190 --> 05:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
mean the the intent here is pretty much
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
the type of I um I mean my original
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
language just said pets and then o OAS
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
changed it to companion animals um so
 
05:48:07.708 --> 05:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's because companion
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
animals must already be a term some
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
defined um somewhere else in the law
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
that has a specific meaning that would
 
05:48:20.670 --> 05:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
be only applicable to the kinds I'm
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
thinking of which is the types of an
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
people normally people's pets you know
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
dogs cats snakes guinea pigs um rodents
 
05:48:31.520 --> 05:48:35.230 align:start position:0%
dogs cats snakes guinea pigs um rodents
whatever

05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:38.590 --> 05:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
else thank you repola there there is
 
05:48:40.468 --> 05:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
definitions in other areas of Statute
 
05:48:42.510 --> 05:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
for companion animals I'm not sure if
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
there is in 126a specifically we'll have
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
to look into that but representative
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
Oregon yes I assume the term companion
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
animals also encompasses service dogs as
 
05:48:54.670 --> 05:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
well as pets but do you know if there's
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
already a provision in RSA 2026 or
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that uh specifically
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
requires uh humans service animals in
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
there to be uh sheltered along with
 
05:49:07.638 --> 05:49:08.948 align:start position:0%
there to be uh sheltered along with
their

05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:49:12.990 --> 05:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
humans uh thanks for the question and
 
05:49:15.310 --> 05:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
sorry but no I do not
 
05:49:19.110 --> 05:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
know that the answer to that
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Murray thank you
 
05:49:24.910 --> 05:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for taking my question and uh
 
05:49:26.670 --> 05:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
welcome to the committee thank you for
 
05:49:29.310 --> 05:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill before us um I did
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
have one question in addition to I'm
 
05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
still looking for an amendment that I I
 
05:49:36.510 --> 05:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't get track down so thank you for
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
sending that along when you get it but
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
also um is there a limit to physically
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
how many animals
 
05:49:48.270 --> 05:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
may join a person who is seeking shelter
 
05:49:50.350 --> 05:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
during an
 
05:49:50.360 --> 05:49:54.468 align:start position:0%
during an
evacuation

05:49:54.468 --> 05:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
05:49:57.440 --> 05:50:01.070 align:start position:0%
um yeah
they're

05:50:01.070 --> 05:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah all right that's um a fair point
 
05:50:07.990 --> 05:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see one currently WR in this
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
language um I mean i' I'd
 
05:50:11.280 --> 05:50:12.910 align:start position:0%
language um I mean i' I'd
assume

05:50:12.910 --> 05:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
assume
 
05:50:16.590 --> 05:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
that the people doing the evacuations
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
would interpret it reasonably and not
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
try to pack more animals into a room
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
then can fit into it but um if you
 
05:50:29.310 --> 05:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
wouldd like
 
05:50:32.468 --> 05:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
an additional amendment to clarify that
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
I would be open to
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you any further
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions for rip
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
gallager seeing none we thank you sir
 
05:50:46.830 --> 05:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
in okay next we have uh rep Ellen Reed
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.270 --> 05:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
17 good afternoon and welcome to Ena
 
05:50:58.590 --> 05:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:51:01.110 --> 05:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
you honorable members for welcoming me
 
05:51:02.750 --> 05:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
into your committee I believe this is
 
05:51:05.110 --> 05:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
the first time I've ever testified in
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
front of Ena before so thank you very
 
05:51:09.628 --> 05:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
much I actually wasn't planning oh for
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Ellen Reed I
 
05:51:13.390 --> 05:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 17 New Market and
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
new Fields very proudly represent
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 17 I wasn't planning on
 
05:51:20.190 --> 05:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
testifying but as I was hearing the the
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
hearing I had a few thoughts because I
 
05:51:24.990 --> 05:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
have an unrelated but um kind of similar
 
05:51:27.788 --> 05:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
topic bill in another committee and I I
 
05:51:29.548 --> 05:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
happen to have some uh have been working
 
05:51:31.628 --> 05:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
on similar language about these types of
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
issues that bill has to do with pets in
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
rental housing um so I am a co-sponsor
 
05:51:40.270 --> 05:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill I will say that
 
05:51:42.030 --> 05:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
statistically speaking everyone here
 
05:51:45.750 --> 05:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of you own companion animals
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
pets um and when I was introducing this
 
05:51:50.830 --> 05:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
other bill I had a member I want to say
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
of the opposite party but there is no
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
opposite party for me anymore so for my
 
05:51:59.390 --> 05:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
former opposite Party come to me after
 
05:52:02.430 --> 05:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
and say can you imagine can you imagine
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
having to choose between giving up your
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
animal who will most certainly die or
 
05:52:11.948 --> 05:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
having to choose being homeless and that
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
was very poignant in fact that
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
particular member was recounting to me a
 
05:52:18.110 --> 05:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
story of one of her friends having to
 
05:52:21.628 --> 05:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
lose her housing because um of a dog
 
05:52:23.548 --> 05:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
that she had now can you imagine that
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
awful choice and now combine it with an
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
emergency a weather event or whatever
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
and you being displaced from your home
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
and on top of all of the trauma and all
 
05:52:37.310 --> 05:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the loss having to lose your beloved
 
05:52:40.110 --> 05:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
Companion Animal on top of it or being
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
forced to not be insecure housing
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
because you've decided to choose to make
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure that your animal stays alive
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
because you have that profound sense of
 
05:52:51.190 --> 05:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
of obligation to to that
 
05:52:55.468 --> 05:52:55.478 align:start position:0%
animal so um in terms of the questions
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
that were brought up about definitions
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
of which an animal uh in in the language
 
05:53:03.030 --> 05:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
I've worked on separately I use the
 
05:53:05.468 --> 05:53:05.478 align:start position:0%
definition cats dogs and animals in
 
05:53:08.670 --> 05:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
enclosures so that would be caged or
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
aquarium type animals so that I felt
 
05:53:11.948 --> 05:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
that that was very reasonable in terms
 
05:53:14.510 --> 05:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
of limiting it to something that wasn't
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
llamas and farm animals and what have
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
you um I do think this is a reasonable
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
idea I'm happy to work with the
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee members who are interested as
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
well as rep Gallagher on further
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
amendments to to help clarify those
 
05:53:29.430 --> 05:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
definitions also the limit in the
 
05:53:30.990 --> 05:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
language I've worked on on a separate
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill I use the limit by saying whatever
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal ordinances exists so if
 
05:53:38.548 --> 05:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
Municipal ordinance exists that says no
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
more than six cats then that would be
 
05:53:44.670 --> 05:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
apply to whatever the individual um
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
separate family housing structure that
 
05:53:49.310 --> 05:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
exists that is the shelter so I just
 
05:53:50.990 --> 05:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to put those little notes out
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
there again I'm happy to work on
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment if that's um what the members
 
05:53:56.190 --> 05:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
of this committee would be interested in
 
05:53:59.230 --> 05:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative any
 
05:54:02.468 --> 05:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
uh questions for representative
 
05:54:05.150 --> 05:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
Reed I did really well it easy and I I
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
think your assistance would be uh
 
05:54:11.590 --> 05:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
you okay our final pink card that I have
 
05:54:24.270 --> 05:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
AKC good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Stacy oer I
 
05:54:31.910 --> 05:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
am the legislative analyst and community
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
outreach contact in New England for the
 
05:54:39.110 --> 05:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
American Kennel Club uh the AKC is a 135
 
05:54:41.548 --> 05:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
yearold not for-profit organization
 
05:54:45.468 --> 05:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
that's recognized as an expert in K9
 
05:54:48.270 --> 05:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
Health breeding training and responsible
 
05:54:51.788 --> 05:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
dog ownership and when we saw this bill
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
we were're grateful that rep Gallagher
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
has raised it and support the intent of
 
05:54:58.510 --> 05:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:55:01.948 --> 05:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
um you've already heard the consequence
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
of Katrina resulting in uh federal law
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
to establish the pets act which creates
 
05:55:11.230 --> 05:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
some standards around evacuation and
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
transportation of pets my understanding
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
is that back in '06 New Hampshire did
 
05:55:21.390 --> 05:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
enact statutory language that requires
 
05:55:25.708 --> 05:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
uh shelters the femous shelters to house
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
the service animals that might go with
 
05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
an individual a disabled person who
 
05:55:32.590 --> 05:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
would have a service animal to be sure
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
they weren't separated um and AKC has in
 
05:55:40.350 --> 05:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
the past few years uh with our clubs
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
raised funds to establish disaster
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
animal disaster relief trailers and we
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
have deployed 92 of these trailers
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
across the country because we know
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
people will refuse to evacuate if they
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
can't bring their companion animal with
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
them um we have 12 more trailers that
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
are in the pipeline to be distributed
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
and so not knowing whether or not that
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
was a gap here for New Hampshire had
 
05:56:10.830 --> 05:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
discussed with New Hampshire dogs
 
05:56:12.830 --> 05:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not um the clubs in New
 
05:56:14.590 --> 05:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be interested in in
 
05:56:17.788 --> 05:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
looking to fund a trailer um I did reach
 
05:56:20.750 --> 05:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
out and speak to the individual over at
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS about the DART program here in New
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and she acknowledged that
 
05:56:28.830 --> 05:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
there are four Trail trailers here in
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh that probably could
 
05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
accommodate about 200 companion animals
 
05:56:36.270 --> 05:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh if there were a
 
05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
disaster and I think that's important
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's important to acknowledge because we
 
05:56:43.948 --> 05:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
know for instance in the recent past
 
05:56:45.750 --> 05:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
there was the flooding in New York City
 
05:56:47.708 --> 05:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
as a consequence of the hurricane that
 
05:56:50.350 --> 05:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
hit uh the southern part of the country
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
we know that Kentucky just suffered
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
those uh tornadoes for instance uh so it
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
is a crucial uh part of the emergency
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
plan I did read online that New
 
05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does have its emergency plan
 
05:57:06.270 --> 05:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
and it's carved up by state agency and
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
chapter so for instance the Department
 
05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture has responsibility for
 
05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
creating a plan for agricultural animals
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
and livestock and my understanding is
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility for companion
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
animals that would be housed in domicile
 
05:57:24.510 --> 05:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
or people's residences and homes was
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
transferred over to DHHS right before Co
 
05:57:27.600 --> 05:57:28.788 align:start position:0%
transferred over to DHHS right before Co
hit

05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
hit
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
so there really hasn't been a lot of
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
work that's been done in um implementing
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
and the volunteer uh network has fallen
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
apart so to speak uh because of the
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
issue heard rep Gallagher address in his
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment around um volunteers who are
 
05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
trained in the transport of dogs cats
 
05:57:52.510 --> 05:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm told Turtles are very popular in
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a companion animal um
 
05:57:59.510 --> 05:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a dis incentive to become a
 
05:58:02.070 --> 05:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
trained volunteer because under the
 
05:58:06.190 --> 05:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers uh anyone who is a
 
05:58:08.468 --> 05:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
Public Employee whether that be for the
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
state or a local subdivision there are
 
05:58:13.230 --> 05:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
certain Protections in the event you're
 
05:58:15.510 --> 05:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
deployed and you might be injured while
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
providing those uh uh those
 
05:58:20.510 --> 05:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and that same
 
05:58:23.190 --> 05:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
protection doesn't exist for the
 
05:58:26.110 --> 05:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
disaster animal Response Team volunteers
 
05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm grateful to rep Gallagher for
 
05:58:30.670 --> 05:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
working on some language uh with the
 
05:58:32.910 --> 05:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office to attempt to address
 
05:58:34.548 --> 05:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
that because of those are some
 
05:58:36.670 --> 05:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental pieces I think that ought to
 
05:58:39.150 --> 05:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
be put in place so that the program can
 
05:58:42.468 --> 05:58:42.478 align:start position:0%
um reconvene and and formalize itself
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
and um eliminate some of these gaps on
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
the question of how many animals I agree
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
with rep Reed that commonly there may be
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
by local ordinance a uh limit for
 
05:58:55.230 --> 05:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
instance on how many dogs you can own
 
05:58:57.070 --> 05:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
without before having to get a kennel
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
license and I will share with you that
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
AKC when we do our kennel inspections uh
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have our club members fill out
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork and do recordkeeping and
 
05:59:10.310 --> 05:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
included as part of that is to have an
 
05:59:13.150 --> 05:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
emergency evacuation plan for those dogs
 
05:59:16.030 --> 05:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
that would be in your kennel um so
 
05:59:17.548 --> 05:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
that's a critical component that's
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
covered by a and the clubs as
 
05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your
 
05:59:25.468 --> 05:59:25.478 align:start position:0%
support all right thank you for
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
Testimony any questions uh
 
05:59:28.830 --> 05:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
05:59:31.230 --> 05:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
um yes I I did have one question for you
 
05:59:32.990 --> 05:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I also just wanted to call to the
 
05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
record that the amendment did make its
 
05:59:37.948 --> 05:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
way to us so it is there um also thank
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:59:45.868 --> 05:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
um I am curious so you did mention that
 
05:59:48.350 --> 05:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
obviously the dart vehicle uh trailers
 
05:59:52.110 --> 05:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
are already there um would those be also
 
05:59:54.510 --> 05:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
would they be transporting those animals
 
05:59:55.868 --> 05:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to educate myself would they
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
be transported to another location or
 
05:59:57.840 --> 05:59:58.830 align:start position:0%
be transported to another location or
would

05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:00:01.390 --> 06:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
those when the animals are then put on
 
06:00:03.190 --> 06:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
those safety trailers where would they
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
go after that so my understanding is the
 
06:00:07.948 --> 06:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for trailers are between
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
16 and 24 feet long and they would come
 
06:00:14.070 --> 06:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
supplied with everything you would need
 
06:00:16.708 --> 06:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to quickly identify animals
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
who the owner is it would come with um
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
crates so that you could individually
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
shelter those animals and move them to
 
06:00:25.948 --> 06:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
safety whatever wherever that might be
 
06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was a flood a fire or tornado
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
I guess arguably if the only public
 
06:00:35.468 --> 06:00:35.478 align:start position:0%
shelter was uh let's say an a an
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
auditorium then arguably the the
 
06:00:39.628 --> 06:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
trailers could be in the parking lot and
 
06:00:42.390 --> 06:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
that would perhaps suffice as ter in in
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
the context of keeping um owners with
 
06:00:47.788 --> 06:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
their companion animals in close
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
proximity thank
 
06:00:53.628 --> 06:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
you excuse me representative Bixby yes
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question U I'm
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is leg legislation or
 
06:01:01.390 --> 06:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
if there are laws in other states that
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
we could use as um that might help us uh
 
06:01:07.468 --> 06:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
as as a model for this because it I have
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
this feeling that the bill as pres I
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment but I have
 
06:01:13.150 --> 06:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
the feeling that the bill is has
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
presented doesn't have a lot of the
 
06:01:14.958 --> 06:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
presented doesn't have a lot of the
working

06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:01:18.510 --> 06:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms necessary to to actually make
 
06:01:18.520 --> 06:01:19.468 align:start position:0%
mechanisms necessary to to actually make
this

06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:21.310 --> 06:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
operational I think one of the biggest
 
06:01:24.030 --> 06:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
issues is probably funding I my
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that DHHS had
 
06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated getting a Federal grant so
 
06:01:31.190 --> 06:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
they could hire a program manager so
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
these responsibilities were brought over
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
to DHHS and assigned to someone who has
 
06:01:38.628 --> 06:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility for other programs um the
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
grant didn't go forward as an
 
06:01:42.350 --> 06:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
application because it was specific
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
under the uh US Department of Homeland
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
Security for terrorism and that's kind
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
of a narrow focus and uh animal
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
relocation in a disaster would include
 
06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
so many other traumatic events outside
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
of terrorism so apparently that was not
 
06:02:03.070 --> 06:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
a viable funding opportunity as they had
 
06:02:05.628 --> 06:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
hoped for um but I do think that it
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be um very helpful if there was
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
funding for a program manager to pull
 
06:02:13.990 --> 06:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
all of those straight pieces
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
together thank
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for is
 
06:02:23.310 --> 06:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
over I have read through the amendment
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
real quickly and it appears to address
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
the liability protection that you were
 
06:02:32.190 --> 06:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
looking for but um it does not address
 
06:02:33.548 --> 06:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
some of the other concerns that were
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
raised here so we may have some further
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
work to do on that but we'll um
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
certainly get copies for everyone to
 
06:02:41.708 --> 06:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
see all right thank you for your
 
06:02:43.468 --> 06:02:43.478 align:start position:0%

06:04:39.990 --> 06:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
put in a pink card but I won't be uh
 
06:04:42.468 --> 06:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
questioning any of the other testifiers
 
06:04:44.590 --> 06:04:44.600 align:start position:0%

chairman good afternoon uh honorable
 
06:05:52.948 --> 06:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues um so since I have joined the
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
legislature I have been educated in many
 
06:05:58.990 --> 06:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
areas of law uh but nothing surprised me
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
quite like
 
06:06:02.948 --> 06:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
decline I've always known decline was
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
painful barbaric and should never be
 
06:06:07.390 --> 06:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
allowed but after learning the specifics
 
06:06:09.510 --> 06:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
and what the procedure actually consists
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
of I'm truly surprised that it is still
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
allowed the lure consistently shows that
 
06:06:17.230 --> 06:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
decline has permanent and detrimental
 
06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
effects on cats uh quick disclaimer
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are many sources used throughout
 
06:06:23.628 --> 06:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
my testimony and after I get home
 
06:06:25.390 --> 06:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
tonight I will send the committee uh
 
06:06:27.750 --> 06:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony with the those sources
 
06:06:30.830 --> 06:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh for your reference uh so there is uh
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
no literature that I could find that
 
06:06:35.830 --> 06:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
states decline is harmless an article in
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
the Journal of feline medicine and
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
surgery from 2018 shows de declaw cats
 
06:06:44.350 --> 06:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
one Bitmore two used a litter box less
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
three have back pain and four are overg
 
06:06:51.390 --> 06:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
groomed uh which is a sign of pain and
 
06:06:53.628 --> 06:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
frustration if there is any literature
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
that offers information to disprove it I
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
would love to see it
 
06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'll now briefly highlight five
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
important facts related to some
 
06:07:05.430 --> 06:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
objections I anticipate you may hear uh
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
so first decline is common and a law is
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
needed to stop it an estimated 20% to
 
06:07:14.788 --> 06:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
25% of own cats are
 
06:07:17.190 --> 06:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
declawed I keep hearing that declawing
 
06:07:19.030 --> 06:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
is rare but this stat consistently
 
06:07:21.150 --> 06:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
disproves that again I have searched for
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
alternative information but cannot find
 
06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
it in 2014 a survey of 3,000
 
06:07:28.830 --> 06:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarians only 24% responded that
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
they do not
 
06:07:34.670 --> 06:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
declo also in 2014 a report out of North
 
06:07:38.910 --> 06:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
Carolina 21% of cat 21% of cats seen in
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
vet hospitals were
 
06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
declawed so I find it hard that we can
 
06:07:44.670 --> 06:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
truly consider that
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
uncommon now outside of the USA uh you
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
may be wondering what other countries
 
06:07:51.510 --> 06:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
are doing Canada is the only other
 
06:07:54.270 --> 06:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
nation that regularly declaw eight out
 
06:07:57.628 --> 06:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
of 10 of their provinces uh have banned
 
06:08:00.430 --> 06:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
it with the two remaining pending
 
06:08:02.708 --> 06:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
legislation in the UK the College of
 
06:08:04.468 --> 06:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
veterinarian services coins it
 
06:08:07.590 --> 06:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary mutilation Veterinary
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
Ireland has pointed out that the cat uh
 
06:08:12.990 --> 06:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
gets no benefits from this and quote
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
while commonly performed in USA it is
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
not performed in Ireland and any
 
06:08:19.628 --> 06:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
Veterinary practitioner performing this
 
06:08:21.270 --> 06:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
act would clearly be open to
 
06:08:24.390 --> 06:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action this mindset is not
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
uncommon in the rest of the world's
 
06:08:28.750 --> 06:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
countries again only the US and Canada
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
practice this
 
06:08:33.230 --> 06:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
currently two uh decline cats do not
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
keep cats out of shelters on the
 
06:08:37.548 --> 06:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
contrary declaw bands keep cats out of
 
06:08:39.750 --> 06:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
shelters a survey of shelters and
 
06:08:41.468 --> 06:08:41.478 align:start position:0%
Rescuers show that these entities have
 
06:08:43.628 --> 06:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
strict no declaw policies in their
 
06:08:45.868 --> 06:08:45.878 align:start position:0%
contracts why would an organization that
 
06:08:48.590 --> 06:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
is desperate to find animals a home
 
06:08:51.230 --> 06:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
disqualify potential adopters only on
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
the basis that they are going uh to
 
06:08:56.030 --> 06:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
declaw their cat I have two cats and
 
06:08:58.110 --> 06:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
that question was asked uh when I
 
06:09:00.830 --> 06:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
adopted them they know that declawed
 
06:09:02.910 --> 06:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
cats bite more and use the litter box
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
less if someone is intolerant of cat
 
06:09:07.230 --> 06:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
scratching which is a very normal feline
 
06:09:09.190 --> 06:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
Behavior enough that they seek a maming
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
surgery to stop it that person is really
 
06:09:13.708 --> 06:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
going to probably be intolerant of a cat
 
06:09:16.110 --> 06:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
peeing on the couch or biting to defend
 
06:09:18.670 --> 06:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
itself or the other consistent
 
06:09:21.868 --> 06:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues that we have seen a
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
study published in 2021 examined data
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
from 3 years prior and 3 years after
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
Durban in British Columbia and found no
 
06:09:30.548 --> 06:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
difference in the number of cats
 
06:09:32.670 --> 06:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
surrendered including those surrendered
 
06:09:35.190 --> 06:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
specifically for destructive scratching
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
there was also no difference in the
 
06:09:39.628 --> 06:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
length of time cats spent at the shelter
 
06:09:41.868 --> 06:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
or a number of cats that were euthanized
 
06:09:44.350 --> 06:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
however the number of owner requested
 
06:09:47.150 --> 06:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
euthanize Asia decreased after the
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
ban excuse me considering uh the time of
 
06:09:52.990 --> 06:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
the committee I will just state that
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
there are many examples from other
 
06:09:57.150 --> 06:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
studies like one in La that I uh will
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
provide through uh
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
email so to conclude this point in a
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
survey of owners of cats that had been
 
06:10:06.030 --> 06:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
brought in to be declawed by their
 
06:10:08.350 --> 06:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarians only 4% of owners said
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
that they would relinquish their pets if
 
06:10:13.510 --> 06:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
it could not be declawed in contrast the
 
06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the survey speculated
 
06:10:17.070 --> 06:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
that 50% of those owners would have
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
relinquished their
 
06:10:21.548 --> 06:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
pets uh and again it was only
 
06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
4% uh so third Point laser decline uh is
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
not painless uh or better for cats where
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
lasers are used uh it they essentially
 
06:10:34.910 --> 06:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
burn uh the cat's toe tissues the
 
06:10:37.230 --> 06:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
American Animal Hospital Association
 
06:10:40.430 --> 06:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
published a study that only 12.2% of
 
06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian hospitals use this
 
06:10:45.788 --> 06:10:45.798 align:start position:0%
technique research shows that lasers
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
offered no benefit over a more
 
06:10:50.070 --> 06:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
conventional method of declawing finding
 
06:10:51.628 --> 06:10:51.638 align:start position:0%
differences in discomfort and
 
06:10:55.310 --> 06:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
complications between groups treated um
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
were not clinically r
 
06:10:59.310 --> 06:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
another study found complications such
 
06:11:01.830 --> 06:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
as bleeding limping swelling infections
 
06:11:03.868 --> 06:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
were generally worse in the laser
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
decline group compared against uh blade
 
06:11:10.990 --> 06:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
laser decline can result uh in fourth
 
06:11:11.000 --> 06:11:11.948 align:start position:0%
laser decline can result uh in fourth
degree

06:11:11.948 --> 06:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
degree
 
06:11:14.990 --> 06:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
burns it can leave the cat suffering
 
06:11:17.150 --> 06:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
from bony fragments left under the skin
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
just like any other method of decline so
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely not a per uh ferred
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
method four exemp exemptions for the
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
cat's medical and physical health Health
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
are already included in this bill the
 
06:11:31.948 --> 06:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
language is that a physical or medical
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
condition that compromises the health or
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
well-being of the animal but not
 
06:11:38.468 --> 06:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
including cosmetic reasons or reasons of
 
06:11:40.830 --> 06:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
convenience uh in the keeping or
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
handling of the animal so medical
 
06:11:46.230 --> 06:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
necessity like a tumor or a deformity of
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
the toe is
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
included decline to avert cat scratching
 
06:11:52.990 --> 06:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
is not allowed in this bill like I said
 
06:11:56.548 --> 06:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
declawed cats develop far worse Behavior
 
06:11:58.110 --> 06:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
than the scratching ever was and
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
therefore will likely lose their homes
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
for those behaviors not using the litter
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
box and biting are the number one one
 
06:12:05.868 --> 06:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
and two behavioral reasons that cats
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
lose their home decline can and in many
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
cases does cause both these bad
 
06:12:12.990 --> 06:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
behaviors medical exemptions for the
 
06:12:14.830 --> 06:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
well-being of the cat owner are not
 
06:12:16.750 --> 06:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
warranted because there is no valid
 
06:12:19.350 --> 06:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
human health reason to declaw a cat
 
06:12:22.030 --> 06:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
which will bring me to
 
06:12:24.990 --> 06:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
0.5 uh people with compromised immune
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
systems do not need to declaw their cat
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
in fact decl cats to prevent human
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses is not recommended by the CDC
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
the US Public Health Service uh the
 
06:12:36.510 --> 06:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Health or
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
infectious disease experts just to make
 
06:12:41.190 --> 06:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
the point one more time all around the
 
06:12:42.910 --> 06:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
world people are living with indoor cats
 
06:12:45.310 --> 06:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
and not decline them despite human
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
health issues this is because there is
 
06:12:50.590 --> 06:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
no reason to decline cat for the already
 
06:12:50.600 --> 06:12:52.788 align:start position:0%
no reason to decline cat for the already
said

06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
reasons uh you know personally I I
 
06:12:57.708 --> 06:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
believe CDC and those other
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
organizations are the ones that we
 
06:13:01.350 --> 06:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
should listen to regarding uh human
 
06:13:01.360 --> 06:13:03.070 align:start position:0%
should listen to regarding uh human
health

06:13:03.070 --> 06:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
health
 
06:13:06.390 --> 06:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh and uh yeah so I'll conclude here Mr
 
06:13:08.270 --> 06:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um so for the reasons just
 
06:13:09.948 --> 06:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
stated Banning decline is good for
 
06:13:12.230 --> 06:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
everyone uh it's a horrible surgery that
 
06:13:14.590 --> 06:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
was invented in the 1950s to stop a very
 
06:13:16.868 --> 06:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
normal behavior at this point we know
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
better uh and we should do better I
 
06:13:21.070 --> 06:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
humbly ask for your support I think this
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan issue I think the cats
 
06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
have the right for the highest uh
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
standard of Medical Care
 
06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
I think cats have the right to bear arms
 
06:13:31.468 --> 06:13:31.478 align:start position:0%
uh I ask for your
 
06:13:34.350 --> 06:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
support and I am happy to take any
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions um and there will be um
 
06:13:39.590 --> 06:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in support of the bill
 
06:13:41.390 --> 06:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
testifying after uh who you can also
 
06:13:43.628 --> 06:13:43.638 align:start position:0%
direct questions to thank you
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Aaron
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:13:50.910 --> 06:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny for your
 
06:13:54.190 --> 06:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill um I do have a
 
06:13:57.948 --> 06:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
question in your bill you said say that
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
first of all that this is a clas D
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to dclock hat um but it also
 
06:14:10.350 --> 06:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
says that it gives an exception um that
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know whatever medical condition the
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
cat such as uh recurring illness disease
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
injury abnormal condition of the claw so
 
06:14:22.310 --> 06:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
for instance if there's a tumor on one
 
06:14:24.390 --> 06:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
paw of the
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
cat I'm assuming this bill would allow
 
06:14:31.110 --> 06:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian to remove the
 
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
claw would that be of the entire paw or
 
06:14:38.190 --> 06:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
just one or all of them I mean it's it
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't State
 
06:14:43.230 --> 06:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
specifically how that medical procedure
 
06:14:44.628 --> 06:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
be uh done sure and at risk of being a
 
06:14:50.990 --> 06:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you know I think it would be
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
important to determine that yeah sure
 
06:14:57.590 --> 06:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
and um there will be vets who um speak
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
after me but to my understanding if
 
06:15:02.070 --> 06:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's a tumor on just one claw then
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
the whole paw does not have to be
 
06:15:08.110 --> 06:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
declawed is that your question right so
 
06:15:13.830 --> 06:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
follow up so if the veterinarian then
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
declaws the toes that do not have the
 
06:15:20.350 --> 06:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
illness or disease on it would they be
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
facing a misdemeanor
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
charge um how I could answer that is if
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
there is a medic I reason to take off
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
the other um the other claws on the Paw
 
06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
then then yes but um you know basically
 
06:15:40.110 --> 06:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
if there is a reason um medically and a
 
06:15:42.830 --> 06:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian feels so then that would be
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
allowed thank
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:15:49.990 --> 06:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murray uh thank
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question and
 
06:15:54.110 --> 06:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you to the prime sponsor for um
 
06:15:56.468 --> 06:15:56.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question as well can you speak
 
06:15:56.478 --> 06:15:58.990 align:start position:0%
taking my question as well can you speak
to

06:15:58.990 --> 06:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:16:03.310 --> 06:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
the um fiscal note a little bit in the
 
06:16:06.510 --> 06:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
how is it in the event of a a
 
06:16:08.948 --> 06:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor are we actually we're
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:16.150 --> 06:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
individual um so for the there's a lot
 
06:16:20.910 --> 06:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
of ambiguity in the um fiscal note um
 
06:16:22.750 --> 06:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
one sentence says a new case study is
 
06:16:25.150 --> 06:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
being conducted and updated uh estimates
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
will be a available in the future
 
06:16:29.520 --> 06:16:31.230 align:start position:0%
will be a available in the future
um

06:16:31.230 --> 06:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:34.350 --> 06:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
but so so a lot of it is indeterminable
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
right now um in the bill it's a
 
06:16:40.670 --> 06:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um so however the law deals
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
with that misdemeanor is how the bill
 
06:16:45.910 --> 06:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
would deal with it okay thank you
 
06:16:45.920 --> 06:16:48.270 align:start position:0%
would deal with it okay thank you
representative

06:16:48.270 --> 06:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:16:50.670 --> 06:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you for taking my question
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
and recognizing me um the question that
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
I had uh was similar to that it says any
 
06:16:57.788 --> 06:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
person who violates this section will be
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
guilty of a Class B misdemeanor so would
 
06:17:03.750 --> 06:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
that be the owner and the
 
06:17:07.990 --> 06:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
vet um so to my understanding I I I
 
06:17:09.708 --> 06:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
believe it would be the veterinarian
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
because the veterinarian would have to
 
06:17:13.628 --> 06:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
be practicing um the
 
06:17:16.270 --> 06:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
decline okay thank
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you for taking my question
 
06:17:25.680 --> 06:17:27.350 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you for taking my question
so

06:17:27.350 --> 06:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:32.110 --> 06:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
so why do you not see that the
 
06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
relationship between the vet and the cat
 
06:17:34.440 --> 06:17:36.310 align:start position:0%
relationship between the vet and the cat
owner

06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
owner
 
06:17:36.320 --> 06:17:41.948 align:start position:0%
owner
itself

06:17:41.948 --> 06:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:44.788 --> 06:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
is shouldn't this decision be between
 
06:17:47.548 --> 06:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
them and not us and should it not be
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
reprimanded because it's between an
 
06:17:52.350 --> 06:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
animal and their professional
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that's doing declawing sure
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well veterinarians uh from around
 
06:18:00.070 --> 06:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
the world come out because this is a
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
barbaric practice for uh to be honest
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
there's there's very limited reasons why
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh decline is necessary it's been quite
 
06:18:11.670 --> 06:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
commonly since the 50s used more for
 
06:18:14.310 --> 06:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
convenience um again if there is a
 
06:18:16.910 --> 06:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate medical reason then this bill
 
06:18:20.468 --> 06:18:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:23.670 --> 06:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
that representative Murray uh thank you
 
06:18:25.750 --> 06:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
for Tak my question thank you also when
 
06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh let's go back to that point about
 
06:18:30.948 --> 06:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
medical reasons for the health of the um
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
owner as well is there any situation
 
06:18:36.350 --> 06:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
where that would be a reason for which
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary uh no um you
 
06:18:42.990 --> 06:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
know according to um human human health
 
06:18:46.468 --> 06:18:46.478 align:start position:0%
experts um that there's there's been no
 
06:18:49.310 --> 06:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
evidence of that the only um the only
 
06:18:50.590 --> 06:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
place where you have seen that is
 
06:18:52.948 --> 06:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
through the recommendations of of
 
06:18:52.958 --> 06:18:53.948 align:start position:0%
through the recommendations of of
certain

06:18:53.948 --> 06:18:53.958 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians thank you
 
06:19:00.190 --> 06:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:19:04.750 --> 06:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I would ask one
 
06:19:07.948 --> 06:19:07.958 align:start position:0%
so we have to dis you know the the
 
06:19:09.270 --> 06:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
charge of our committee is always
 
06:19:11.390 --> 06:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
looking at policy relating to animals
 
06:19:14.190 --> 06:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
and and their care certainly
 
06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
and when we start down a path of going
 
06:19:20.190 --> 06:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
into deciding Veterinary decisions
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
versus in owner
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
decisions information that should be on
 
06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we kind of get into an area that
 
06:19:27.788 --> 06:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
gets a little touchy at times and I
 
06:19:29.190 --> 06:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
think you've had a couple of questions
 
06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
in in fact the last one was one I was
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to ask about the health of the
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
owner as well but is there um has there
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
been any consideration given to
 
06:19:41.510 --> 06:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
why that why this would be good public
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
policy I understand that you're looking
 
06:19:46.830 --> 06:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
at at the health of the cat but about as
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
far as general policy if we start down
 
06:19:51.628 --> 06:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
this path of deciding Veterinary
 
06:19:55.390 --> 06:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
ownership decisions you know would would
 
06:19:56.750 --> 06:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
would you see that extending into other
 
06:19:59.830 --> 06:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
animals as well beyond cats um no
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
personally I wouldn't only because um
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of surprised me was
 
06:20:06.468 --> 06:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
most of the world has never done this
 
06:20:08.948 --> 06:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
because again they just view it as
 
06:20:11.510 --> 06:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
barbaric um so you know I don't think
 
06:20:13.468 --> 06:20:13.478 align:start position:0%
it's a slippery slope I I think
 
06:20:17.310 --> 06:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
primarily right now um cats are are the
 
06:20:19.310 --> 06:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
animal being declawed and there's really
 
06:20:22.590 --> 06:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
no justifiable reason for it um although
 
06:20:24.510 --> 06:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
if it was happening to other animals I
 
06:20:26.590 --> 06:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
don't think it should there too because
 
06:20:29.390 --> 06:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
again other than the few uh medical
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasons which the bill does allow
 
06:20:33.230 --> 06:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason other than
 
06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
convenience um that that I've seen uh
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know including about human health um
 
06:20:39.760 --> 06:20:41.468 align:start position:0%
you know including about human health um
for

06:20:41.468 --> 06:20:41.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:20:44.628 --> 06:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
decline thank you any further question
 
06:20:47.548 --> 06:20:47.558 align:start position:0%
we have one more I do apologize I I'm
 
06:20:49.788 --> 06:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
just looking through the bill and I
 
06:20:52.830 --> 06:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to make doubly and triple sure
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about would be
 
06:20:55.200 --> 06:20:56.190 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about would be
Cit

06:20:56.190 --> 06:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
Cit
 
06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
against the entity performing the
 
06:21:02.788 --> 06:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
declawing and or would this potentially
 
06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
then by default
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
because the individual who owns the cat
 
06:21:11.708 --> 06:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
is signing off on the medical procedure
 
06:21:13.990 --> 06:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
asking for that like who where does the
 
06:21:14.000 --> 06:21:15.150 align:start position:0%
asking for that like who where does the
legal

06:21:15.150 --> 06:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
legal
 
06:21:18.830 --> 06:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
liability lie with the person
 
06:21:20.990 --> 06:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
potentially being charged with the
 
06:21:25.070 --> 06:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sure so um line four it says
 
06:21:29.310 --> 06:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
um that no person shall remove the claw
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's essentially saying that
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the vet because you know if if an
 
06:21:37.548 --> 06:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
owner wants it a vet would have to um
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
perform the
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
surgery thank you any further
 
06:21:45.430 --> 06:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative we
 
06:21:48.430 --> 06:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you so
 
06:21:51.670 --> 06:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
much okay next up we have uh rep Timothy
 
06:21:53.548 --> 06:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
Horgan from
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
straford I'm not sure is that straford
 
06:21:58.708 --> 06:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
six yes okay thank
 
06:22:01.070 --> 06:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
you um as most of you probably know
 
06:22:02.190 --> 06:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
because I've been sitting here all day
 
06:22:03.628 --> 06:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
I'm represented Timothy Horan from
 
06:22:05.548 --> 06:22:05.558 align:start position:0%
straford County district 6 to towns of
 
06:22:07.510 --> 06:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
Durham and Madbury and that's the same
 
06:22:10.670 --> 06:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
district that rent Kenny represents and
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I have indeed uh mat and petted his
 
06:22:16.110 --> 06:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
cats they're like truly outstanding
 
06:22:19.110 --> 06:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
felines not just like all other felines
 
06:22:21.708 --> 06:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
um I just want reiterate this is a
 
06:22:25.070 --> 06:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
barbaric practice it um the fing jamine
 
06:22:26.468 --> 06:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
basically means you're they're cutting
 
06:22:30.430 --> 06:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
the uh last fance we also have three
 
06:22:33.070 --> 06:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
fanes on all our fingers and two on our
 
06:22:34.510 --> 06:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
toes and big toes so like you're
 
06:22:37.030 --> 06:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
basically amputating the cat's fingers
 
06:22:38.190 --> 06:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
and then if you do it in the back you're
 
06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
amputating his toes too so that's um
 
06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
just as bad or maybe even worse for a
 
06:22:45.430 --> 06:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
cat than if it happened to one of us
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
because they're just as sensitive
 
06:22:50.510 --> 06:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
probably more so than um than we humans
 
06:22:53.468 --> 06:22:53.478 align:start position:0%
are so that that alone is a a reason to
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
reason to ban it it uh
 
06:22:58.590 --> 06:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
and uh sometimes sometimes decline is
 
06:23:00.468 --> 06:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
Justified because they'll scratch their
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
humans or others who annoy them but
 
06:23:04.868 --> 06:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
usually uh usually scratching is one of
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
their first lines of defenses and then
 
06:23:09.548 --> 06:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
after that uh biting is one of the next
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
ones so they basally they're skipping
 
06:23:13.468 --> 06:23:13.478 align:start position:0%
their first way of one of their first
 
06:23:15.070 --> 06:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
ways of telling you to back off and then
 
06:23:17.430 --> 06:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
they have to go straight to biting and
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
that also uh that probably also
 
06:23:22.030 --> 06:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
partially explains uh the worst use of
 
06:23:23.628 --> 06:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
the litter box aside from the fact that
 
06:23:25.868 --> 06:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
like it can't just like you human who
 
06:23:27.150 --> 06:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have all his fingers would be
 
06:23:28.948 --> 06:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
less happy all things being equ than
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
someone who has all his fingers can't um
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
the can't be less happy and there's uh
 
06:23:37.190 --> 06:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
it does appear that usually there's a
 
06:23:39.510 --> 06:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
lot of residual pain and even if they're
 
06:23:42.030 --> 06:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
um and then that's also a means of uh
 
06:23:44.750 --> 06:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
marking their territory in terms of uh
 
06:23:46.310 --> 06:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
terms of scratching your furniture I
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
guess that depends on what your
 
06:23:50.590 --> 06:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
priorities are but there are uh tips you
 
06:23:54.468 --> 06:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
can affix to their their claws which uh
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know make their claws
 
06:23:59.350 --> 06:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
softer and um so I just think this is a
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
barbaric practice that should be should
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
be outlawed and um answer ver Erin's
 
06:24:06.190 --> 06:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
question if for some reason this
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prevent a vet from amputating
 
06:24:10.990 --> 06:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
the cat's leg or front or back leg or
 
06:24:13.590 --> 06:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
even just a foot if that was uh
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
medically needed because the cat had
 
06:24:17.628 --> 06:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
cancer or an injury or something so
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
that's uh and I myself one of my late
 
06:24:22.750 --> 06:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
cats I did have to have one of the claws
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
taken off because he dislocated it well
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
climbing a tree when he's about 18 years
 
06:24:29.510 --> 06:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
old and too old to be climbing trees
 
06:24:33.230 --> 06:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
like that but um so uh I think this bill
 
06:24:36.230 --> 06:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
is uh this bill is very well drafted um
 
06:24:38.190 --> 06:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
and it's been for this committee before
 
06:24:39.788 --> 06:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
and hopefully this time we'll we'll pass
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
it and send it on its way to the cross
 
06:24:43.948 --> 06:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
the wall to the other body and hopefully
 
06:24:46.910 --> 06:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
for Signature by the governor who I
 
06:24:48.990 --> 06:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
learned this summer is uh very fond of
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
cats himself so he's I think I think
 
06:24:52.750 --> 06:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
he'll be happy to be able to sign this
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill so thanks any questions
 
06:24:55.920 --> 06:24:57.270 align:start position:0%
bill so thanks any questions
rep

06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
rep
 
06:24:59.990 --> 06:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
pamola yes sir thank you for taking my
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
my question um I I just have to be
 
06:25:04.670 --> 06:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
honest I'm sitting here thinking how
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
different this conversation would be if
 
06:25:07.548 --> 06:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
we were talking about a fetus and not
 
06:25:10.590 --> 06:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
cat claws um but I'll just say that uh
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
do you have sir do you know how many uh
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
decline procedures happen in the state
 
06:25:17.468 --> 06:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
every year just so we have some
 
06:25:20.310 --> 06:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't I don't own a cat so
 
06:25:23.230 --> 06:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
well the estimate uh estimate I seen is
 
06:25:28.910 --> 06:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
about 25% of the uh 25% of of uh of cats
 
06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh in the United States have been
 
06:25:33.230 --> 06:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
declawed and virtually zero elsewhere
 
06:25:35.270 --> 06:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
so do you
 
06:25:38.750 --> 06:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
so do so do you have any statistics or
 
06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
if maybe maybe somebody might provide
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
that after you but do you have any
 
06:25:43.590 --> 06:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
statistics on how many times this
 
06:25:47.628 --> 06:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
procedure is performed in New Hampshire
 
06:25:49.830 --> 06:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
um that yeah you might have to ask
 
06:25:51.468 --> 06:25:51.478 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody El probably would ask
 
06:25:53.910 --> 06:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else about it I know um first
 
06:25:55.830 --> 06:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
many vets are uh
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
many RS are elant to uh elant to do the
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
procedure and or if you do ask them to
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
do it they would uh you know try to Cel
 
06:26:04.750 --> 06:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
you to make sure you really understood
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
the implications of it but I I don't
 
06:26:09.190 --> 06:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
have the number maybe somebody has an
 
06:26:12.430 --> 06:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
estimate I don't know thank
 
06:26:15.708 --> 06:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
sir representative Aaron thank you Mr
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Horgan so
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
my question is I know the um previous
 
06:26:25.788 --> 06:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
speaker and and uh sponsor of the bill
 
06:26:27.468 --> 06:26:27.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was no health
 
06:26:31.548 --> 06:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
issues of owners that would require a
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
cat to be
 
06:26:37.510 --> 06:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
declawed what if a person had developed
 
06:26:40.030 --> 06:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of illness that uh required
 
06:26:41.430 --> 06:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
them to be on blood
 
06:26:41.440 --> 06:26:42.948 align:start position:0%
them to be on blood
thinners

06:26:42.948 --> 06:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
thinners
 
06:26:46.110 --> 06:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
and their cat then
 
06:26:49.548 --> 06:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
became a you know problem with that
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
because of their claws and despite any
 
06:26:56.830 --> 06:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
kind of behavior modification trials or
 
06:27:01.030 --> 06:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
other ways to uh prevent the cat from
 
06:27:04.310 --> 06:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
scratching them they would have then the
 
06:27:07.230 --> 06:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
decision of whether to keep the cat or
 
06:27:11.590 --> 06:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
not um in this situation would you say
 
06:27:14.910 --> 06:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
that the owner would be justified for
 
06:27:17.830 --> 06:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
their own health reasons to have be able
 
06:27:20.708 --> 06:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
to have the cat declaw um well
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
my first this is a little out of my area
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
of expertise although I did have a
 
06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
family member who was taking warer and
 
06:27:28.910 --> 06:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
and had a cat living in the household
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
with her and
 
06:27:35.628 --> 06:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
um and and um they did not die of that
 
06:27:38.230 --> 06:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
so and even with even in the absence of
 
06:27:39.548 --> 06:27:39.558 align:start position:0%
cats there's lots of other things that
 
06:27:41.468 --> 06:27:41.478 align:start position:0%
can scratch you and cause minor minor
 
06:27:43.750 --> 06:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
bleeding so he probably had to have a
 
06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
strategy for dealing with that
 
06:27:48.750 --> 06:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
possibility anyway so uh that might I
 
06:27:50.070 --> 06:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
think probably deploying the cat would
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
not be your first alternative and uh
 
06:27:56.590 --> 06:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
frankly that may be uh and then perhaps
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
you may may want to probably the best
 
06:28:01.070 --> 06:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
thing to do if you if you don't have a
 
06:28:03.110 --> 06:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
way of you know dealing with that
 
06:28:05.670 --> 06:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with minor bleeding is to you
 
06:28:08.390 --> 06:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
might have to rehome the cat which is uh
 
06:28:09.990 --> 06:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
a terrible thing to say but it's not as
 
06:28:12.910 --> 06:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
bad as cutting off it's uh fingers I
 
06:28:16.110 --> 06:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
think so thanks thank you probably not
 
06:28:18.868 --> 06:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
the answer you wanted to hear
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah thank you for taking my
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
question um the original owners of my
 
06:28:29.788 --> 06:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
house had two dogs and I still have uh
 
06:28:32.548 --> 06:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
doors that have been gouged uh from
 
06:28:37.510 --> 06:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
those dogs yeah so my question is um how
 
06:28:41.548 --> 06:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
much how many times do we do declawing
 
06:28:46.030 --> 06:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
of dogs and and if not why not since
 
06:28:50.830 --> 06:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
they can also tear apart um furniture
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
and uh woodwork well we
 
06:28:57.190 --> 06:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
um this this bill is about cats um with
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
with the dogs we did have a bill which
 
06:29:00.788 --> 06:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
has come to this committee a number of
 
06:29:02.788 --> 06:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
times I sponsored it at least once if I
 
06:29:05.310 --> 06:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
remember offand and uh just a band
 
06:29:07.230 --> 06:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
taking off the do Claws from the cat and
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
we got uh we got a lot of push back from
 
06:29:13.468 --> 06:29:13.478 align:start position:0%
various people who felt that they um
 
06:29:15.150 --> 06:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
especially dog especially dogs are
 
06:29:16.548 --> 06:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
trained to trace animals and tight
 
06:29:19.468 --> 06:29:19.478 align:start position:0%
spaces were concerned that the uh dog
 
06:29:21.548 --> 06:29:21.558 align:start position:0%
might get caught on his two claw in the
 
06:29:23.708 --> 06:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
tunnel or whatever it's going through so
 
06:29:25.750 --> 06:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
there it's uh
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
it has been uh there have been bills
 
06:29:29.190 --> 06:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
about that and they haven't uh they
 
06:29:31.230 --> 06:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
haven't passed yet and uh as far as I
 
06:29:33.670 --> 06:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
know actually have the whole list of
 
06:29:35.548 --> 06:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
bills on my desk there there's not one
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
of those this year but yeah that yeah we
 
06:29:41.070 --> 06:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
did anyway we did have a bill about not
 
06:29:42.750 --> 06:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
not we have been had a bill in the past
 
06:29:45.030 --> 06:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
about not Banning the appication of du
 
06:29:47.670 --> 06:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
Claws and that which is just the claw
 
06:29:50.110 --> 06:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
which cats have sort of on their wrist
 
06:29:53.190 --> 06:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that actually frankly has failed
 
06:29:54.910 --> 06:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of there's just a lot of
 
06:29:58.030 --> 06:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
resistance from U especially from uh The
 
06:30:00.190 --> 06:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club and dog readers and people
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
like that so that's I guess it didn't
 
06:30:04.070 --> 06:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
come with this year just because you
 
06:30:05.628 --> 06:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
know we're not operating a full capacity
 
06:30:08.190 --> 06:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
in the house we want to pick our battles
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
so follow up yeah Ju Just to be clear do
 
06:30:16.990 --> 06:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know of cases where we declaw dogs
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh for cosmetic reasons or because they
 
06:30:22.030 --> 06:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
destroy Furniture um I I don't know but
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
it probably has happened
 
06:30:23.840 --> 06:30:25.628 align:start position:0%
it probably has happened
f

06:30:25.628 --> 06:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
f
 
06:30:27.468 --> 06:30:27.478 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:30:29.948 --> 06:30:29.958 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to ask one actually
 
06:30:32.270 --> 06:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
you I want to clarify and make sure that
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
I heard what you said earlier you were
 
06:30:36.628 --> 06:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
made a statement about there wasn't a
 
06:30:38.670 --> 06:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
lot of veterinaries that were doing it
 
06:30:39.990 --> 06:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
and they see would have a long
 
06:30:42.670 --> 06:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with their clients so my
 
06:30:44.190 --> 06:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
question is do you feel like the
 
06:30:46.388 --> 06:30:46.398 align:start position:0%
veterinaries are doing a good job in
 
06:30:48.468 --> 06:30:48.478 align:start position:0%
educating their clients on the benefits
 
06:30:51.868 --> 06:30:51.878 align:start position:0%
or issues with the cats when they do
 
06:30:54.830 --> 06:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
this perform this well procedure this
 
06:30:56.190 --> 06:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
particular procedure I've never wanted
 
06:30:57.990 --> 06:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be done to my cat the one time I had
 
06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
one toe cut off was because the cat was
 
06:31:04.548 --> 06:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
injured and I um I was uh I was
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do it and I've heard that
 
06:31:08.270 --> 06:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
was that was many years ago in that
 
06:31:09.548 --> 06:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
particular vet I was back when I was
 
06:31:11.468 --> 06:31:11.478 align:start position:0%
living in the Upper Valley I for if that
 
06:31:13.110 --> 06:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
was actually based in Vermont but I do
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
know he um I do know he if you come in
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
ask him to claw the cat I've heard him
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
them try to talk other clients out of it
 
06:31:22.948 --> 06:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
and I mean most veterans are very caring
 
06:31:26.948 --> 06:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
people they're uh probably in general uh
 
06:31:28.590 --> 06:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
better at their job than human doctors
 
06:31:31.030 --> 06:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
are so I think I my companion Andel here
 
06:31:32.548 --> 06:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
I think have gotten better Medical Care
 
06:31:34.150 --> 06:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
than I've gotten from my doctors not
 
06:31:35.310 --> 06:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
that I haven't had some very good
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
doctors but
 
06:31:40.990 --> 06:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh any other questions
 
06:31:43.628 --> 06:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
testimony all right next up we have H
 
06:31:47.350 --> 06:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reid from
 
06:31:47.360 --> 06:31:50.230 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reid from
Rockingham

06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:53.590 --> 06:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
17 welcome again to the ENA thank you
 
06:31:56.548 --> 06:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair again I am Ellen Reed I
 
06:31:58.230 --> 06:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 17 New Market and
 
06:32:01.030 --> 06:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
newfields again I'm very uh grateful
 
06:32:02.150 --> 06:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
that you're welcoming me to your
 
06:32:05.110 --> 06:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee and um again I actually wasn't
 
06:32:07.110 --> 06:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
planning on speaking but I did hear a
 
06:32:10.270 --> 06:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
couple things I wanted to to mention um
 
06:32:12.430 --> 06:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
the idea of a slippery slope or starting
 
06:32:14.430 --> 06:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
something new we already have cruelty
 
06:32:16.628 --> 06:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
statute for domesticated animals and
 
06:32:19.030 --> 06:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
animals in captivity longstanding
 
06:32:20.430 --> 06:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty statute which I'm sure you're
 
06:32:22.910 --> 06:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with so the concept is not a
 
06:32:25.150 --> 06:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
New Concept we do prohibit certain types
 
06:32:28.270 --> 06:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
of actions acted upon animals in
 
06:32:31.110 --> 06:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
captivity um and certainly I think if
 
06:32:34.030 --> 06:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
you think about it and just imagine if
 
06:32:36.150 --> 06:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
every single one of your fingers and
 
06:32:39.030 --> 06:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
toes were amputated or burned off at the
 
06:32:41.750 --> 06:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
first knuckle the kind of pain and
 
06:32:44.230 --> 06:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
impairment that that would cause that
 
06:32:46.628 --> 06:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
certainly would qualify if it was done
 
06:32:50.310 --> 06:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
for no reason uh for your health as
 
06:32:53.350 --> 06:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
cruelty in your mind and because of that
 
06:32:55.030 --> 06:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
I think personally it should under our
 
06:32:56.868 --> 06:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
cruelty statute unfortunately it's not
 
06:32:59.830 --> 06:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
been considered um to do so prior to
 
06:33:03.468 --> 06:33:03.478 align:start position:0%
this but it's not a New Concept to say
 
06:33:05.230 --> 06:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
that we have to prohibit certain
 
06:33:06.788 --> 06:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
behaviors towards
 
06:33:09.510 --> 06:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
animals the the difference here is the
 
06:33:13.150 --> 06:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
doctor element human doctors are held to
 
06:33:14.868 --> 06:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
the standard that they have to always
 
06:33:16.910 --> 06:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
act in the best interest of their
 
06:33:18.910 --> 06:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
patient whereas veterinarians are not
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
held to that standard certainly I think
 
06:33:22.628 --> 06:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
probably the majority of veterinarians
 
06:33:24.590 --> 06:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
believe in that standard but they're not
 
06:33:27.310 --> 06:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
legally required they can do something
 
06:33:29.270 --> 06:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
that is not in The Animals best interest
 
06:33:31.310 --> 06:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
in fact I was speaking with my vet once
 
06:33:34.150 --> 06:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
and he said he had to put an animal down
 
06:33:35.670 --> 06:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
he actually refused to do it but the
 
06:33:37.948 --> 06:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
owner requested that he put the animal
 
06:33:39.990 --> 06:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
down because um the animal was allergic
 
06:33:41.110 --> 06:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
to her
 
06:33:43.868 --> 06:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
perfume um that's not something a human
 
06:33:45.990 --> 06:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
doctor would ever consider obviously
 
06:33:48.590 --> 06:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
just really quick on the idea of if if a
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
person developed like you know
 
06:33:52.948 --> 06:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
hemophilia or had to take blood thinners
 
06:33:55.590 --> 06:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is is that if you
 
06:33:57.868 --> 06:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
have that condition that the if the
 
06:34:00.110 --> 06:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
animal doesn't have claws the next thing
 
06:34:02.030 --> 06:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to do is bite and how much
 
06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
worse the bleeding would be from a bite
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
rather than a scratch but the
 
06:34:08.590 --> 06:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives exist the Caps that you can
 
06:34:10.510 --> 06:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
have and they they they wear off after a
 
06:34:13.310 --> 06:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
few weeks the Caps can be placed on the
 
06:34:16.830 --> 06:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
the claws of the cat but also just and I
 
06:34:17.948 --> 06:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
think this is the number one thing
 
06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
because we talk about this as a
 
06:34:22.708 --> 06:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
convenience thing providing for any
 
06:34:24.670 --> 06:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
animal that you decide to own being
 
06:34:26.468 --> 06:34:26.478 align:start position:0%
responsible in providing the appropriate
 
06:34:28.388 --> 06:34:28.398 align:start position:0%
material so the animal can engage in
 
06:34:30.430 --> 06:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
their natural behaviors providing
 
06:34:33.628 --> 06:34:33.638 align:start position:0%
scratching posts providing um
 
06:34:35.590 --> 06:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
attractants to the scratching posts and
 
06:34:37.388 --> 06:34:37.398 align:start position:0%
the toys that you provide and then
 
06:34:39.030 --> 06:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
deterrence on your furniture these
 
06:34:42.868 --> 06:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
things exist so anyway uh again I just
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
had a few comments and thoughts as we
 
06:34:45.388 --> 06:34:45.398 align:start position:0%
were going through the hearing and
 
06:34:47.628 --> 06:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to share them I appreciate your
 
06:34:51.388 --> 06:34:51.398 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative any
 
06:34:54.990 --> 06:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you next
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
up we have representative Chris Schultz
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
nine welcome to the ENA
 
06:35:06.270 --> 06:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair it's
 
06:35:08.430 --> 06:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
an honor to be here with you all today I
 
06:35:10.150 --> 06:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
would have been here even if I wasn't
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
subbing because I'm a co-sponsor of the
 
06:35:15.788 --> 06:35:15.798 align:start position:0%
bill and while I'm not an animal expert
 
06:35:18.430 --> 06:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
overall certainly not agriculture expert
 
06:35:21.310 --> 06:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
overall uh my marriage depended on a
 
06:35:24.030 --> 06:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about cat Decline and in
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
brief I will tell you that story and
 
06:35:29.230 --> 06:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
some of the things that impacted my
 
06:35:31.070 --> 06:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
decision and hopefully this is helpful
 
06:35:32.788 --> 06:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully it mirrors the conversations
 
06:35:34.670 --> 06:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people have around this
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
issue that can be helpful uh growing up
 
06:35:41.030 --> 06:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
I had to during the summer I agreed to
 
06:35:43.110 --> 06:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
really take care of the neighbor's cat
 
06:35:46.388 --> 06:35:46.398 align:start position:0%
when they went uh to their camp out of
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
town and that sies cat hated
 
06:35:55.070 --> 06:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
me and I developed a fear cats because
 
06:35:58.270 --> 06:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
of that I liked the extra money so I
 
06:36:00.670 --> 06:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
found my way to run in feed the cat
 
06:36:04.030 --> 06:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
scoop the litter get out uh and that
 
06:36:06.670 --> 06:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuated a fear of cats into my
 
06:36:09.670 --> 06:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
adulthood I did not know any friendly
 
06:36:13.030 --> 06:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
cats other than my experience with this
 
06:36:16.670 --> 06:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
cat then I met my now husband uh
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
definitely a cat person I brought a pug
 
06:36:23.670 --> 06:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
along with me and marrying me meant you
 
06:36:24.910 --> 06:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
got the pug
 
06:36:28.708 --> 06:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
too um and over time we discussed often
 
06:36:31.388 --> 06:36:31.398 align:start position:0%
you know cat people dog people thinking
 
06:36:34.150 --> 06:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
these issues out and not only was my
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
fear a concern but so was the I'd heard
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
cats can destroy your
 
06:36:42.910 --> 06:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
furniture uh I was worried would the cat
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
get along with my pug he's used to being
 
06:36:48.510 --> 06:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
the only pet in the house uh long story
 
06:36:51.070 --> 06:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
short I first talked to my dog's vet who
 
06:36:53.628 --> 06:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
also cared for cats and she went into
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
great details
 
06:36:58.868 --> 06:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
about how harmful cat dcang was and
 
06:37:02.110 --> 06:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
encouraged me to look at the literature
 
06:37:04.830 --> 06:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
on uh actually buying some books she
 
06:37:07.388 --> 06:37:07.398 align:start position:0%
recommended that you can actually not as
 
06:37:09.468 --> 06:37:09.478 align:start position:0%
much as a dog maybe but you can do
 
06:37:11.830 --> 06:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
certain things with a cat that is
 
06:37:14.948 --> 06:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
essentially training a cat and I was
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
skeptical at first long story short
 
06:37:21.548 --> 06:37:21.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully um I learned a lot from that
 
06:37:24.628 --> 06:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
and decided for my husband's sake that
 
06:37:27.270 --> 06:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
getting a cat was the right thing to do
 
06:37:29.430 --> 06:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we definitely had some challenges at
 
06:37:29.440 --> 06:37:30.270 align:start position:0%
and we definitely had some challenges at
the

06:37:30.270 --> 06:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:37:32.430 --> 06:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
beginning my husband at one point even
 
06:37:34.230 --> 06:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
thought about returning the cat to the
 
06:37:37.070 --> 06:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
SPCA here in conquer where we adopted
 
06:37:40.150 --> 06:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
him and I'm so glad we didn't he's a
 
06:37:42.548 --> 06:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
wonderful addition to our family and
 
06:37:44.388 --> 06:37:44.398 align:start position:0%
there were ways to keep him from
 
06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
scratching the furniture There were ways
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
to keep him from using his claws on us
 
06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
when we played and we slowly introduced
 
06:37:55.868 --> 06:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
him to our dog and um knowing the
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
cruelty that happens to cats because of
 
06:38:00.310 --> 06:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
deawing if it's something that isn't
 
06:38:00.320 --> 06:38:01.310 align:start position:0%
deawing if it's something that isn't
medically

06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
medically
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
necessary um it's not even just about
 
06:38:06.150 --> 06:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
missing your fingers and toes it's about
 
06:38:10.190 --> 06:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
how cats move in general cats uh you
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
know obviously don't move the same way
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
as humans but having that contact on the
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
objects that they're on uh is a really
 
06:38:23.270 --> 06:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
crucial thing too it's not just the you
 
06:38:25.868 --> 06:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
know missing fingers and toes it's an
 
06:38:28.150 --> 06:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
integral part of their senses I don't
 
06:38:29.388 --> 06:38:29.398 align:start position:0%
know maybe you could say it's an
 
06:38:31.270 --> 06:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
additional sense I'm not that kind of an
 
06:38:33.708 --> 06:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
expert to say that but I certainly am
 
06:38:35.670 --> 06:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
glad that we made the decision we
 
06:38:38.990 --> 06:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
did and um you know I get that this
 
06:38:42.990 --> 06:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee has a culture and developed uh
 
06:38:44.670 --> 06:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
you know just like other committees that
 
06:38:47.788 --> 06:38:47.798 align:start position:0%
I've served on to look at the bills that
 
06:38:49.628 --> 06:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
come before you and I know that you've
 
06:38:53.190 --> 06:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
had bills about ear docking of dogs tail
 
06:38:56.948 --> 06:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
docking uh I had a pug who his Duke claw
 
06:38:59.708 --> 06:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
were gone before I adopted him I didn't
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
know that would be a decision that was
 
06:39:02.750 --> 06:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
made and I didn't know anything about
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
that at that time anyway but um I don't
 
06:39:08.670 --> 06:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
know that the decisions around other
 
06:39:12.468 --> 06:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
animals necessarily impacts this one um
 
06:39:14.230 --> 06:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how to think or feel
 
06:39:16.628 --> 06:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
about that I get that you have developed
 
06:39:19.230 --> 06:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
your own um way of looking at these
 
06:39:21.270 --> 06:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
issues but I would encourage you to
 
06:39:23.990 --> 06:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that uh over
 
06:39:27.110 --> 06:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the vets in America won't
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
do this but there are vets who do and
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
like representative cam Kenny said and
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
all the facts that he presented I think
 
06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
they're compelling um you know
 
06:39:39.310 --> 06:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
apparently we're one of the few
 
06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
countries that even uh has this as a
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
practice and I would suggest that uh
 
06:39:50.388 --> 06:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
decla cats is is a is a fear-based
 
06:39:50.398 --> 06:39:52.270 align:start position:0%
decla cats is is a is a fear-based
vanity

06:39:52.270 --> 06:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
vanity
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
decision uh that unknowingly people do
 
06:40:00.910 --> 06:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
because maybe it was a norm to their
 
06:40:04.590 --> 06:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
introduction of cats but because not
 
06:40:07.788 --> 06:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
everyone has uh learned what I've
 
06:40:09.590 --> 06:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
learned not everybody researches that
 
06:40:12.750 --> 06:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
much I do think that understanding the
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals as it is that decline
 
06:40:21.070 --> 06:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
cats uh uh is worthy of inclusion in
 
06:40:25.510 --> 06:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that um how we as a State look at cats
 
06:40:28.468 --> 06:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
and decisions about cruelty to cats I
 
06:40:30.190 --> 06:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
think it's an integral thing and I will
 
06:40:32.670 --> 06:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
add and I don't think he's here our
 
06:40:34.788 --> 06:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
friend representative abis is a
 
06:40:36.868 --> 06:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
supporter of this uh hopefully he will
 
06:40:38.830 --> 06:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
be emailing you you know he's a cat
 
06:40:42.510 --> 06:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
person too and um we talk about our cats
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
often so I don't know if that's
 
06:40:47.430 --> 06:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
persuasive to any Republicans but um it
 
06:40:50.830 --> 06:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan issue so I hope that's
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
helpful and I'm happy to take any
 
06:40:54.708 --> 06:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
06:40:54.718 --> 06:40:56.590 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
representative

06:40:56.590 --> 06:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:40:59.310 --> 06:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
Schultz seeing none we thank you for oh
 
06:41:01.510 --> 06:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed you looked right over
 
06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
you all right representative Duty uh
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz do you think if
 
06:41:09.230 --> 06:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill that this would give
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians another tool in which
 
06:41:17.990 --> 06:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
to um basically use with clients or
 
06:41:20.910 --> 06:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
customers you know who want to have uh
 
06:41:24.030 --> 06:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
declin for a cosmetic reason um um
 
06:41:26.788 --> 06:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
because my assumption would be that
 
06:41:28.990 --> 06:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're put in a difficult position
 
06:41:30.788 --> 06:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
between what they feel is the best for
 
06:41:34.548 --> 06:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
the animal and uh having being pressured
 
06:41:37.948 --> 06:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
by a customer I what's your opinion well
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely and our new vet actually
 
06:41:42.948 --> 06:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it my state WRA and
 
06:41:46.510 --> 06:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
this bill came up uh Veterinary Schools
 
06:41:48.750 --> 06:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
often now aren't even teaching this as a
 
06:41:52.070 --> 06:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
practice except as any other emergency
 
06:41:54.628 --> 06:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
procedure they might have to perform
 
06:41:58.868 --> 06:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
on any animal's bones or limbs or skin
 
06:42:02.190 --> 06:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know uh well I don't know
 
06:42:04.030 --> 06:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
the statistics of how many veterinary
 
06:42:06.110 --> 06:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
schools aren't teaching it as a practice
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
but it certainly is becoming a norm but
 
06:42:13.070 --> 06:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
the pressures from unknowing families
 
06:42:15.230 --> 06:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
that want a cat I think it would be very
 
06:42:17.510 --> 06:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to that decision for the state
 
06:42:19.830 --> 06:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
to have this as a part of our animal
 
06:42:19.840 --> 06:42:22.750 align:start position:0%
to have this as a part of our animal
cruelty

06:42:22.750 --> 06:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:22.760 --> 06:42:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
laws

06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
laws
 
06:42:24.360 --> 06:42:25.990 align:start position:0%
laws
representative

06:42:25.990 --> 06:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:42:28.350 --> 06:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
comto thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
06:42:31.040 --> 06:42:31.948 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
if

06:42:31.948 --> 06:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:42:35.468 --> 06:42:35.478 align:start position:0%
we Outlaw declaring do you think that
 
06:42:38.070 --> 06:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
these uh owners who want to declaw their
 
06:42:39.788 --> 06:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
cats would find other means that are
 
06:42:42.388 --> 06:42:42.398 align:start position:0%
actually more unsafe and unhealthy I
 
06:42:44.750 --> 06:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
hope not obviously that's a hypothetical
 
06:42:47.150 --> 06:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to that I certainly
 
06:42:50.230 --> 06:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
think I do know a family in my district
 
06:42:51.708 --> 06:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
that had made that decision and we've
 
06:42:54.910 --> 06:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
talked about it I would hope
 
06:42:59.788 --> 06:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
that anyone who has a pet has a a vet
 
06:43:02.590 --> 06:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
that they can speak to I would
 
06:43:05.230 --> 06:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
hope uh that that would be considered
 
06:43:07.150 --> 06:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
any other thing than the law where
 
06:43:08.868 --> 06:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
someone takes something into their own
 
06:43:10.510 --> 06:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
hands I mean I don't know I mean that's
 
06:43:12.548 --> 06:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical that I hope wouldn't
 
06:43:14.788 --> 06:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
happen but geez people make some weird
 
06:43:17.190 --> 06:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
decisions sometimes I would hope not and
 
06:43:20.430 --> 06:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
I would consider it cruelty if they
 
06:43:22.510 --> 06:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
did any further
 
06:43:24.388 --> 06:43:24.398 align:start position:0%
questions thank thank you representative
 
06:43:25.830 --> 06:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony thank you
 
06:43:25.840 --> 06:43:27.670 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony thank you
so

06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:30.430 --> 06:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
much next we're going to have uh Richard
 
06:43:34.270 --> 06:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:37.388 --> 06:43:37.398 align:start position:0%
branch good afternoon welcome to Ena
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
06:43:39.830 --> 06:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard
 
06:43:41.150 --> 06:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
headed I'm the government Affairs
 
06:43:43.548 --> 06:43:43.558 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch um
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
as you might expect we do not have a
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
policy position on this bill um I did
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony through the
 
06:43:53.670 --> 06:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
very helpful uh electronic system my
 
06:43:55.868 --> 06:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
request is an amendment on this bill um
 
06:43:58.590 --> 06:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
the bill includes a criminal penalty and
 
06:44:00.910 --> 06:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
there is a statute that deals with the
 
06:44:03.388 --> 06:44:03.398 align:start position:0%
effective data bills that impact the
 
06:44:05.788 --> 06:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh create new criminal
 
06:44:08.270 --> 06:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
or civil penalties and this would fall
 
06:44:12.230 --> 06:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
within RSA 14 col and N um and as I put
 
06:44:14.110 --> 06:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony each law
 
06:44:15.510 --> 06:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
affecting judicial practice and
 
06:44:17.990 --> 06:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
procedure or establishing or eliminating
 
06:44:19.990 --> 06:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
criminal prohibitions civil causes of
 
06:44:22.990 --> 06:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
action or remedies or eliminates uh or
 
06:44:25.750 --> 06:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh or limitations of actions shall take
 
06:44:28.270 --> 06:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
effect January 1 of the following year
 
06:44:30.750 --> 06:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is is fairly
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward um every year
 
06:44:36.430 --> 06:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
legislation amends a wide range of
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
statutes and include criminal Provisions
 
06:44:40.948 --> 06:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
civil Provisions change policies and
 
06:44:43.388 --> 06:44:43.398 align:start position:0%
procedures within the judicial branch
 
06:44:45.230 --> 06:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
with when it comes to a criminal penalty
 
06:44:48.270 --> 06:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
as this statute would create um there's
 
06:44:50.830 --> 06:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
something called J1 which is which is
 
06:44:52.510 --> 06:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
essentially the uniform charge table
 
06:44:54.388 --> 06:44:54.398 align:start position:0%
used by law enforcement officers to
 
06:44:56.788 --> 06:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have a very uniform
 
06:44:59.190 --> 06:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
system of charging individuals that
 
06:45:00.910 --> 06:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
takes a little while to get updated
 
06:45:02.190 --> 06:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Department of
 
06:45:05.150 --> 06:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
Justice work on that within the judicial
 
06:45:07.670 --> 06:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
branch we have a system called Odyssey
 
06:45:11.708 --> 06:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
so every line of code in in the J1 and
 
06:45:13.990 --> 06:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
in our Odyssey database have to match up
 
06:45:15.590 --> 06:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the statutory Provisions where
 
06:45:17.788 --> 06:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal penalty there are
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
lots of them and every time there's even
 
06:45:22.590 --> 06:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
the slightest tweak in one of those all
 
06:45:24.388 --> 06:45:24.398 align:start position:0%
of those things have to to get adjusted
 
06:45:26.468 --> 06:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
and and realigned to whatever the new
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
Criminal penalty is you know if it's a
 
06:45:30.670 --> 06:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
drug it may be the amount of the drug it
 
06:45:32.708 --> 06:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
takes a long time to get all those
 
06:45:35.430 --> 06:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
things lined up to train law enforcement
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
to train the judges so there's a statute
 
06:45:39.910 --> 06:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
that says if you're doing any of those
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
things it should be a January 1
 
06:45:44.990 --> 06:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
effective date so my simple request is
 
06:45:47.948 --> 06:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
is that the um the effective dat of the
 
06:45:50.350 --> 06:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
bill be changed to January 1
 
06:45:52.350 --> 06:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
2023 and with that I'd be happy to
 
06:45:54.110 --> 06:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
06:45:56.230 --> 06:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Aaron yes
 
06:45:57.750 --> 06:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you so much
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and for giving
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon my question is
 
06:46:06.190 --> 06:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to be
 
06:46:09.750 --> 06:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
passed how would somebody
 
06:46:09.760 --> 06:46:12.070 align:start position:0%
passed how would somebody
be

06:46:12.070 --> 06:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:46:17.070 --> 06:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
um reported or I mean if this is between
 
06:46:20.270 --> 06:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian who maybe doesn't know
 
06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
the law or maybe doesn't care about
 
06:46:25.310 --> 06:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
about the law and does it
 
06:46:29.788 --> 06:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
anyway um who who might be somebody who
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
would report such an
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
action family members who don't get
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
along um uh there could be a wide range
 
06:46:40.910 --> 06:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
of of people probably I can come up with
 
06:46:41.830 --> 06:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
a 100
 
06:46:43.750 --> 06:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals um but I'll start with
 
06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
spouses that are
 
06:46:50.868 --> 06:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
fighting okay uh follow up follow up so
 
06:46:53.468 --> 06:46:53.478 align:start position:0%
and is there would there be some sort of
 
06:46:56.150 --> 06:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
time limit where somebody would be able
 
06:46:59.230 --> 06:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
to report a veterinarian for doing that
 
06:47:02.190 --> 06:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
I mean um say somebody had their cat
 
06:47:05.270 --> 06:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
declawed prior to this law going into
 
06:47:08.190 --> 06:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
effect would they be able to report that
 
06:47:10.190 --> 06:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's cat was
 
06:47:13.388 --> 06:47:13.398 align:start position:0%
declawed in a you know previous time so
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
so generally if if uh if at the time the
 
06:47:17.708 --> 06:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
ACT occurred it was not a crime it
 
06:47:19.468 --> 06:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't become a crime by passage of of
 
06:47:21.190 --> 06:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
the statute there are statutes of
 
06:47:23.948 --> 06:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
limitations for crimes actually don't
 
06:47:25.548 --> 06:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
know what the clasp of misdemeanor of
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
Statute is I I'm guessing three years
 
06:47:29.070 --> 06:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't know off the top of
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
my head um so there are statutes and
 
06:47:34.628 --> 06:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
limitations you can't go further back in
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
time um based on the statute of
 
06:47:39.468 --> 06:47:39.478 align:start position:0%
limitations and if the Act was not a
 
06:47:41.070 --> 06:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
crime at the time it wouldn't become a
 
06:47:42.548 --> 06:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
crime by virtue of the passage of the
 
06:47:44.990 --> 06:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
06:47:47.990 --> 06:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
you so actually generates a question
 
06:47:49.590 --> 06:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
from a previous question that I heard
 
06:47:52.750 --> 06:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
rep Aon ask another W another person who
 
06:47:55.310 --> 06:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:57.310 --> 06:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
by your read of this who would be the
 
06:47:59.948 --> 06:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
Violator because this is very vague in
 
06:48:01.590 --> 06:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
the sense of any person and knowing the
 
06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
definition of person and statute it's
 
06:48:05.468 --> 06:48:05.478 align:start position:0%
it's pretty wide open could be a
 
06:48:07.388 --> 06:48:07.398 align:start position:0%
business it could be the individual
 
06:48:09.030 --> 06:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
themselves there's there's multiple
 
06:48:11.830 --> 06:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
definitions of what person is in statute
 
06:48:13.990 --> 06:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
how how would the judicial branch
 
06:48:15.868 --> 06:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
interpret this would would you have any
 
06:48:18.708 --> 06:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
guidance for us in a way to for us to
 
06:48:20.788 --> 06:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
understand um so the best thing about my
 
06:48:22.910 --> 06:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
job is I'm not a judge uh I don't I
 
06:48:26.190 --> 06:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
don't uh interpret them um I will talk
 
06:48:28.830 --> 06:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
generally instead of the the statute so
 
06:48:32.110 --> 06:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
as you said person is is uh typically a
 
06:48:33.510 --> 06:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
very broad definition include
 
06:48:36.310 --> 06:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
individuals or corporations um sometimes
 
06:48:39.990 --> 06:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
you see um uh criminal penalties based
 
06:48:41.350 --> 06:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
on whether or not the person is an
 
06:48:44.350 --> 06:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
individual or or a Crim or a corporation
 
06:48:47.948 --> 06:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
um this one does not it does not have
 
06:48:50.948 --> 06:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
um any more specificity than a person so
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
I I would say potentially you know could
 
06:48:57.628 --> 06:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
be the business or it could be uh the
 
06:49:01.230 --> 06:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
individual veterinarian but the the uh
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
the tie is that the statute at least has
 
06:49:08.110 --> 06:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
a a connection between person and the
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
removal of clause so there has to be a
 
06:49:11.628 --> 06:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
direct connection between those two I
 
06:49:14.750 --> 06:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
would assume um and so to whether it be
 
06:49:16.590 --> 06:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
the individual veterinarian or the
 
06:49:19.190 --> 06:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
corporation would be a charging decision
 
06:49:20.670 --> 06:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
as the judicial branch we don't get
 
06:49:22.670 --> 06:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
involved in the charging decisions we
 
06:49:25.830 --> 06:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
only rece receive the the uh the charge
 
06:49:28.070 --> 06:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then go from there understood thank
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
06:49:32.948 --> 06:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we appreciate you
 
06:49:34.708 --> 06:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
coming in your testimony today thank you
 
06:49:36.430 --> 06:49:36.440 align:start position:0%

06:49:39.310 --> 06:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
testify okay next we'll have uh Joyce
 
06:49:52.030 --> 06:49:52.040 align:start position:0%

Boston

06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:58.070 --> 06:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome to the ENA
 
06:49:59.948 --> 06:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon thanks for
 
06:50:04.270 --> 06:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
having me so um my name is Joyce
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
Arabella and I live in New
 
06:50:10.110 --> 06:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
Boston I am a manun hobby breeder my cat
 
06:50:11.948 --> 06:50:11.958 align:start position:0%
is registered with and I'm a member of
 
06:50:13.948 --> 06:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
both cat fanciers Association and Cat
 
06:50:15.990 --> 06:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
fanciers Federation I'm here
 
06:50:16.000 --> 06:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
fanciers Federation I'm here
representing

06:50:17.190 --> 06:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
representing
 
06:50:19.468 --> 06:50:19.478 align:start position:0%
myself I'm here to speak in opposition
 
06:50:20.990 --> 06:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
06:50:23.628 --> 06:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
1226 cats are generally clawed to
 
06:50:25.590 --> 06:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
protect the owner's Furniture walls
 
06:50:27.708 --> 06:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
themselves or their children from being
 
06:50:30.070 --> 06:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
scratched they can unintentionally be
 
06:50:32.030 --> 06:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
quite destructive and even harmful to
 
06:50:34.590 --> 06:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
their owners although there are ways to
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
discourage this Behavior they do not
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
work with all cats the population of
 
06:50:41.548 --> 06:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
cats and animal shelters is always very
 
06:50:44.388 --> 06:50:44.398 align:start position:0%
high declaring prevents abandon
 
06:50:45.708 --> 06:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
abandonment and
 
06:50:48.510 --> 06:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
euthanasia declaring can also be done by
 
06:50:52.388 --> 06:50:52.398 align:start position:0%
laser now this laser method is much less
 
06:50:52.398 --> 06:50:53.468 align:start position:0%
laser now this laser method is much less
painful

06:50:53.468 --> 06:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
painful
 
06:50:55.510 --> 06:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
it minimizes the bleeding and seals the
 
06:50:57.708 --> 06:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
nerve endings during surgery which means
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
less pain faster healing and fewer
 
06:51:04.150 --> 06:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
complications in my opinion declaring
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be a last resort that is decided
 
06:51:08.190 --> 06:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
between an owner and their
 
06:51:10.150 --> 06:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarian however if it is
 
06:51:12.990 --> 06:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
criminalized the owners feel as if they
 
06:51:16.110 --> 06:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
will have no choice and then cats will
 
06:51:18.190 --> 06:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
likely be abandoned Outdoors or
 
06:51:20.788 --> 06:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
surrendered to already cat cat filled
 
06:51:23.948 --> 06:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
shelters and rescues I spoke with my
 
06:51:26.030 --> 06:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarians office and they're not
 
06:51:28.150 --> 06:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any veterinarians in the state
 
06:51:32.510 --> 06:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:35.788 --> 06:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
so if there are any it must be few and
 
06:51:38.750 --> 06:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
far between now that's my opinion now
 
06:51:39.948 --> 06:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
this is not to say they wouldn't
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
consider it if it you know meant the
 
06:51:47.430 --> 06:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
health of the cat or giving up the cat
 
06:51:49.350 --> 06:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the they had tried everything else I
 
06:51:51.110 --> 06:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
think it should be a last
 
06:51:53.750 --> 06:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
resort it seems to me that this isn't a
 
06:51:55.468 --> 06:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire and should be
 
06:51:57.230 --> 06:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
left to the discretion of our vets and
 
06:51:59.830 --> 06:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
their clients rather than put another
 
06:52:01.750 --> 06:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary law on the books just for
 
06:52:03.708 --> 06:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
the sake of having it
 
06:52:07.868 --> 06:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
there and I read I read a lot today to
 
06:52:09.868 --> 06:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
put this together this is a very short
 
06:52:12.548 --> 06:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
testimony but I wrote a thesis that
 
06:52:15.430 --> 06:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
somebody did that showed that cats did
 
06:52:16.830 --> 06:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
not bite
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
more in fact were in shelters longer
 
06:52:25.030 --> 06:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
than cats that were not clawed so in
 
06:52:27.750 --> 06:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
spite of what somebody previously said
 
06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
they do not buy any more than cats with
 
06:52:34.150 --> 06:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
claws and they in fact are in shelters
 
06:52:37.030 --> 06:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
for longer before they're adopted than
 
06:52:38.590 --> 06:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
cats that are not
 
06:52:42.150 --> 06:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
declined and as for the health of people
 
06:52:44.830 --> 06:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
cats often scratch unintentionally I
 
06:52:48.270 --> 06:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
have scratches all over myself and or
 
06:52:49.948 --> 06:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
they in fear you know somebody just
 
06:52:51.468 --> 06:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
takes off and they happen to be standing
 
06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
on your foot and they push off and you
 
06:52:55.830 --> 06:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
got a scratch it happens it's an
 
06:52:57.948 --> 06:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
accident they didn't do it on
 
06:53:03.708 --> 06:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
purpose so these if if your cat has um
 
06:53:06.310 --> 06:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
some germs on their claws that can cause
 
06:53:09.350 --> 06:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
SC cat scratch fever and that's pretty
 
06:53:11.110 --> 06:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable for
 
06:53:16.030 --> 06:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
people so I ask that you recommend hb1
 
06:53:19.230 --> 06:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
1226 in expedient to
 
06:53:21.030 --> 06:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you will you take
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:28.230 --> 06:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
AR I actually do you did you say you
 
06:53:32.150 --> 06:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
were a breeder of cats I am so were are
 
06:53:33.750 --> 06:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
you aware
 
06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
of this being a general practice of
 
06:53:40.070 --> 06:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
decoring cats that amongst the breeder
 
06:53:42.670 --> 06:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
Community absolutely
 
06:53:46.388 --> 06:53:46.398 align:start position:0%
not so that doesn't mean that if it
 
06:53:49.868 --> 06:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
meant saving somebody's pet and all else
 
06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
was exhausted it's in my contract
 
06:53:55.830 --> 06:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
if you have any inklings of declaring
 
06:53:58.670 --> 06:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
please contact me so we can talk about
 
06:54:01.868 --> 06:54:01.878 align:start position:0%
it we can try different solutions can do
 
06:54:06.190 --> 06:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
whatever we need to do to prevent that
 
06:54:09.230 --> 06:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
but as a last resort if you love your
 
06:54:10.910 --> 06:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
cat and you don't want to give it up
 
06:54:14.350 --> 06:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:17.670 --> 06:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
do you know I'm not going to say no to
 
06:54:19.590 --> 06:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that wants to have it done
 
06:54:21.990 --> 06:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
because they're a cat they just can't
 
06:54:24.070 --> 06:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
train it not not to
 
06:54:27.628 --> 06:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
do what is normal so as a instinctual as
 
06:54:29.750 --> 06:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
a breeder do you have conversations with
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
your veterinarian about declaring and it
 
06:54:37.750 --> 06:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
and if it was necessary no okay no I
 
06:54:40.788 --> 06:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't expect to declaw any of my cats
 
06:54:42.910 --> 06:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
okay because I know a lot of tips tips
 
06:54:46.430 --> 06:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
and tricks to stop them and I have a lot
 
06:54:49.468 --> 06:54:49.478 align:start position:0%
of scratching posts around my house sure
 
06:54:52.110 --> 06:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't have an issue with cats
 
06:54:54.310 --> 06:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
scratching my furniture because I have a
 
06:54:54.320 --> 06:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
scratching my furniture because I have a
squirt

06:54:56.150 --> 06:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
squirt
 
06:54:59.110 --> 06:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
gun thank you any other
 
06:55:01.350 --> 06:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you to
 
06:55:04.430 --> 06:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
for coming in today thank you for your
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
time okay next we have uh Christina
 
06:55:16.910 --> 06:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:18.910 --> 06:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good afternoon and welcome to
 
06:55:24.150 --> 06:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
Ena good afternoon uh yes I'm I'm here
 
06:55:29.150 --> 06:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
in heavy support of this bill I did send
 
06:55:32.910 --> 06:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
in um testimony online I'm not sure if
 
06:55:34.628 --> 06:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
any of you got to see
 
06:55:34.638 --> 06:55:36.468 align:start position:0%
any of you got to see
it

06:55:36.468 --> 06:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:55:41.388 --> 06:55:41.398 align:start position:0%
I adopted a cat that was declawed in the
 
06:55:44.430 --> 06:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
90s and I just want to verify
 
06:55:48.230 --> 06:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the person that had that CAT
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
declaw that was the relationship they
 
06:55:52.110 --> 06:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
had with that veterinarian and they
 
06:55:54.190 --> 06:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
decided to do that and then she turned
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
around and said I don't want the
 
06:55:59.868 --> 06:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
cat so the cat I adopted that cat and I
 
06:56:02.788 --> 06:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
had that CAT for over 20 years and I
 
06:56:06.310 --> 06:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
watched that cat suffer his whole life
 
06:56:08.510 --> 06:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay because someone did that to him
 
06:56:11.110 --> 06:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
someone mutilated him and then said I
 
06:56:12.750 --> 06:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't want it and I remember her telling
 
06:56:14.750 --> 06:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
me she says I actually like
 
06:56:18.150 --> 06:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
dogs so it was my gift and my
 
06:56:20.708 --> 06:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
blessing but I had to watch him suffer
 
06:56:23.350 --> 06:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
his whole life
 
06:56:26.388 --> 06:56:26.398 align:start position:0%
he couldn't climb he couldn't scratch he
 
06:56:28.270 --> 06:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a
 
06:56:33.468 --> 06:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
cat and I I remember when I had this
 
06:56:36.110 --> 06:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
cat I remember thinking that if someone
 
06:56:38.628 --> 06:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
offered me a million
 
06:56:41.910 --> 06:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
dollars or a chance to give my cat his
 
06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
fingers back I would have chosen to give
 
06:56:48.910 --> 06:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
my cat his fingers back and that is 100%
 
06:56:50.750 --> 06:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
the truth I can't believe we're even
 
06:56:53.110 --> 06:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill
 
06:56:57.310 --> 06:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
it is it is so cruel it is complete
 
06:57:00.270 --> 06:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
mutilation of an animal just for the
 
06:57:04.510 --> 06:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
sake of doing it you know we have a cat
 
06:57:08.510 --> 06:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
now her name is Manu and she has an
 
06:57:12.750 --> 06:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
extra toe you know what we do we clip
 
06:57:16.910 --> 06:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
her claws we take her up and we hold her
 
06:57:18.510 --> 06:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
and at first she didn't like it but now
 
06:57:20.548 --> 06:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
she knows she gets a treat after it so
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
you can clip the claws too I'm going to
 
06:57:26.350 --> 06:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
tell you back to my my wonderful
 
06:57:29.310 --> 06:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
beautiful cat that I had towards the end
 
06:57:32.868 --> 06:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
of his life he really suffered he had
 
06:57:36.468 --> 06:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
trouble walking he had more pain I was
 
06:57:38.910 --> 06:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
struggling with like what do I
 
06:57:42.868 --> 06:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
do and I'll tell you this right at the
 
06:57:46.468 --> 06:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
end the fur came off of his paws a
 
06:57:49.868 --> 06:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
little bit so you could actually see it
 
06:57:52.030 --> 06:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
and this is what it looked like that's
 
06:57:54.350 --> 06:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
what looked like you could see it he was
 
06:57:57.230 --> 06:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
missing his fingers be because she
 
06:57:59.190 --> 06:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
decided a woman who want I'm sure once
 
06:58:00.990 --> 06:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
she for got rid of the cat she never
 
06:58:02.510 --> 06:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
thought about that cat
 
06:58:06.628 --> 06:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
again and I it's it's just heartbreaking
 
06:58:09.670 --> 06:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
for me and you
 
06:58:13.590 --> 06:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
know to me it's it's it's such obvious
 
06:58:17.150 --> 06:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty and if if you need to do
 
06:58:19.070 --> 06:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
that to your cat or you think you do you
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a cat there's plenty of
 
06:58:24.190 --> 06:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
people people like me that will take
 
06:58:27.868 --> 06:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
more and more cats so I'm just really
 
06:58:29.310 --> 06:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know I'm
 
06:58:31.788 --> 06:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
just I'm very surprised that that
 
06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
there's even this much debate about this
 
06:58:35.830 --> 06:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm telling you right now if you had
 
06:58:38.510 --> 06:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
seen what I had seen and you love that
 
06:58:40.110 --> 06:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
cat like the way I love the cat the way
 
06:58:43.868 --> 06:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
you love your dog the way you love your
 
06:58:46.590 --> 06:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
child why do we do these things what's
 
06:58:49.150 --> 06:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
the quality decision the quality
 
06:58:51.590 --> 06:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
decision is to not mutilate an animal
 
06:58:54.190 --> 06:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
just because
 
06:58:57.628 --> 06:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you today to please
 
06:59:01.310 --> 06:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
support this and let's end this heinous
 
06:59:04.350 --> 06:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
egregious cool
 
06:59:07.388 --> 06:59:07.398 align:start position:0%
practice that's it thank you will you
 
06:59:07.398 --> 06:59:09.270 align:start position:0%
practice that's it thank you will you
take

06:59:09.270 --> 06:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
take
 
06:59:11.190 --> 06:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
questions Miss Snider will you take
 
06:59:13.468 --> 06:59:13.478 align:start position:0%
questions yes okay sure any questions
 
06:59:14.910 --> 06:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
for Miss
 
06:59:17.510 --> 06:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
Snider representative
 
06:59:19.628 --> 06:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:59:22.868 --> 06:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you mentioned
 
06:59:25.708 --> 06:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
clipping of um the
 
06:59:29.350 --> 06:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
claws is that an effective way to um
 
06:59:32.310 --> 06:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
remedy uh scratching damage and injury
 
06:59:36.110 --> 06:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
to children or adults even um and how
 
06:59:37.788 --> 06:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
long does that last before you have to
 
06:59:37.798 --> 06:59:38.948 align:start position:0%
long does that last before you have to
repeat

06:59:38.948 --> 06:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
06:59:41.628 --> 06:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
that yes it is it is
 
06:59:46.350 --> 06:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
effective uh because we do it to our cat
 
06:59:48.190 --> 06:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
and my parents did it to their cat and
 
06:59:50.310 --> 06:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
it lasts usually a couple of weeks and
 
06:59:52.948 --> 06:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
if you have trouble doing that
 
06:59:54.788 --> 06:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's why you have friends that's why
 
06:59:57.070 --> 06:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
you have relatives you can even bring it
 
06:59:59.590 --> 06:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
to your vet and your vet will offer that
 
07:00:01.708 --> 07:00:01.718 align:start position:0%
service and do it for you you can go
 
07:00:04.788 --> 07:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
there and say you know a monthly cat uh
 
07:00:07.070 --> 07:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know Nail clipping for your cat and
 
07:00:09.270 --> 07:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
it is very effective because they still
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
have their fingers but they don't have
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
the sharpness so it's
 
07:00:17.190 --> 07:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
just it's just like a blunt nothing but
 
07:00:19.310 --> 07:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
they still can make it feel like they're
 
07:00:21.230 --> 07:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
scratching so it's very effective it's
 
07:00:24.388 --> 07:00:24.398 align:start position:0%
very simple and a cat can be trained to
 
07:00:26.670 --> 07:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually appreciate it if you give them
 
07:00:28.830 --> 07:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
a treat right after you do
 
07:00:33.150 --> 07:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
it follow up follow up sure what's the
 
07:00:36.628 --> 07:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
extent of that practice of claw clipping
 
07:00:41.110 --> 07:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
um is it as much as 25% of the claw
 
07:00:43.788 --> 07:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
declawing that we've heard about more or
 
07:00:47.030 --> 07:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
less how prevalent is the practice of
 
07:00:49.310 --> 07:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
clipping the claws instead of
 
07:00:51.708 --> 07:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
declawing well I can only go by my
 
07:00:54.070 --> 07:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
experience I know that I know that nail
 
07:00:57.230 --> 07:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
clippers are sold in any store and I
 
07:01:00.150 --> 07:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
know that I personally have done it my
 
07:01:02.150 --> 07:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
family has done it and I know that my
 
07:01:04.150 --> 07:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
friends have done it with their own cats
 
07:01:07.150 --> 07:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
so just within my circles nobody has
 
07:01:09.670 --> 07:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
declawed their cat and they all clip
 
07:01:13.830 --> 07:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:17.830 --> 07:01:17.840 align:start position:0%

Hampshire

07:01:56.270 --> 07:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:59.750 --> 07:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
CR thank you for taking me um actually
 
07:02:02.590 --> 07:02:02.600 align:start position:0%

07:02:05.468 --> 07:02:05.478 align:start position:0%
uh from the group uh sent in uh Nancy
 
07:02:07.990 --> 07:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
Holmes was not able to be here and she
 
07:02:11.350 --> 07:02:11.360 align:start position:0%

basically um she's you know to speak in
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 1226
 
07:02:24.910 --> 07:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
and it's she says like a number of
 
07:02:26.910 --> 07:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
people have said I believe there choices
 
07:02:28.628 --> 07:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
in veterinarian care should remain
 
07:02:31.150 --> 07:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
between the animal owner in the
 
07:02:33.670 --> 07:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
veterinarian any veterinarian or owner
 
07:02:36.310 --> 07:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
currently can particip uh in Partnership
 
07:02:39.510 --> 07:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
choose to determine if the procedure in
 
07:02:42.150 --> 07:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
is right or necessary for a particular
 
07:02:42.160 --> 07:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
is right or necessary for a particular
Pet's

07:02:43.270 --> 07:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
Pet's
 
07:02:45.628 --> 07:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
well-being you know there are situations
 
07:02:49.388 --> 07:02:49.398 align:start position:0%
where cat remains in its home de cling
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
is best option whether to protect the
 
07:02:53.990 --> 07:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
owners health or to prevent cruelty to
 
07:02:56.510 --> 07:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
the animal that is unable to conform to
 
07:02:58.750 --> 07:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
its owner needs or wishes in terms of
 
07:03:00.990 --> 07:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
how and where the claws are
 
07:03:04.788 --> 07:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
used odds for rehoming a cat that is so
 
07:03:06.750 --> 07:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
destructive or so willing to use its
 
07:03:09.468 --> 07:03:09.478 align:start position:0%
claws on people that the person who
 
07:03:12.230 --> 07:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
loves it wants it to you know wants to
 
07:03:15.670 --> 07:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
give it up are poor a frequent recourse
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
is lying about the behavior and before
 
07:03:22.830 --> 07:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
turning around and and giving it to the
 
07:03:25.030 --> 07:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
rescue or whatever organizations out
 
07:03:29.190 --> 07:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
there and you know it's it doesn't
 
07:03:31.750 --> 07:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
because you're and you know I'll expound
 
07:03:34.590 --> 07:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
on this I I've haven't had cats for a
 
07:03:37.350 --> 07:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
long time but the cat I had was more
 
07:03:39.230 --> 07:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
like a dog she followed me everywhere
 
07:03:42.270 --> 07:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
when I was growing up
 
07:03:45.388 --> 07:03:45.398 align:start position:0%
but you know a
 
07:03:48.948 --> 07:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
person loves their animal you cannot
 
07:03:53.868 --> 07:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
always change their you know their
 
07:03:56.110 --> 07:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
behavior I don't care how nice or how
 
07:03:58.270 --> 07:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
bad you know you know you can do you
 
07:04:00.310 --> 07:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
know you can come down on an animal
 
07:04:02.070 --> 07:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
figuring that's going to correct Its
 
07:04:04.230 --> 07:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
Behavior and it's not and you can be
 
07:04:06.030 --> 07:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
real good to it and it's like okay I've
 
07:04:08.350 --> 07:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
I I'm ruling you now the cat is ruling
 
07:04:10.030 --> 07:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
you saying okay I can get anything I
 
07:04:12.708 --> 07:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
want by by using my
 
07:04:15.150 --> 07:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
claws so I think it you know it still
 
07:04:17.230 --> 07:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
boils down to the situation that Nancy
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
says that you know they want to keep
 
07:04:21.070 --> 07:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
their animal they don't want to give it
 
07:04:21.080 --> 07:04:22.270 align:start position:0%
their animal they don't want to give it
up

07:04:22.270 --> 07:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:04:24.510 --> 07:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
they've tried everything else and if
 
07:04:26.750 --> 07:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's the you know situation to to keep
 
07:04:28.750 --> 07:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
this animal in their home instead of
 
07:04:30.990 --> 07:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
trying to pass the behavior off to
 
07:04:33.030 --> 07:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else I think it's worth you
 
07:04:36.150 --> 07:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
know it's worth that it says in a in a
 
07:04:38.388 --> 07:04:38.398 align:start position:0%
recent peer review American veterinarian
 
07:04:41.190 --> 07:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Association article from July
 
07:04:44.788 --> 07:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
23rd 2019 and apparently it was
 
07:04:46.350 --> 07:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee as remote
 
07:04:48.830 --> 07:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
testimony entitled welfare implications
 
07:04:52.388 --> 07:04:52.398 align:start position:0%
of decoring of dis domestic cats
 
07:04:54.628 --> 07:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
this article in part states that PO uh
 
07:04:57.430 --> 07:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
potential benefits to the cat cats are
 
07:04:59.590 --> 07:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
the following in some cases decoring may
 
07:05:03.270 --> 07:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
be an alternative to re re
 
07:05:05.948 --> 07:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
relinquishment outdoor housing meaning
 
07:05:09.788 --> 07:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
shipping the dog out the cat outside or
 
07:05:13.510 --> 07:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
euthanasia for example in a 1991 survey
 
07:05:15.990 --> 07:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
of Ontario veterinarians respondents
 
07:05:18.270 --> 07:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
indicated that approximately 50% of
 
07:05:21.190 --> 07:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
their clients would no longer own their
 
07:05:23.388 --> 07:05:23.398 align:start position:0%
cat if if it had not been for
 
07:05:25.990 --> 07:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
decoring following aggression is a
 
07:05:29.190 --> 07:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
survey of veterinarians reported
 
07:05:31.110 --> 07:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
scratching is the behavioral problem
 
07:05:33.190 --> 07:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
most frequently associated with the
 
07:05:35.548 --> 07:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
abandonment of cats in
 
07:05:38.270 --> 07:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
Brazil unacceptable behaviors such as
 
07:05:40.910 --> 07:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
daily scratching increase the risk of
 
07:05:43.670 --> 07:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
Rel relinquishing of an animal to a
 
07:05:45.868 --> 07:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
shelter and decoring decrease the risk
 
07:05:47.230 --> 07:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
of Rel
 
07:05:50.310 --> 07:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
relinquishing as approximately 72% of
 
07:05:52.910 --> 07:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
cats relinquished two animal shelters
 
07:05:55.468 --> 07:05:55.478 align:start position:0%
are euthanized owners may feel they are
 
07:05:58.310 --> 07:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
faced with choice of decoring their pet
 
07:06:01.350 --> 07:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
cat or potentially condemning it to
 
07:06:04.350 --> 07:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
death there get her part here there is
 
07:06:06.510 --> 07:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
no specific evidence found to support
 
07:06:09.110 --> 07:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
that decoring leads to a higher rate of
 
07:06:11.548 --> 07:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
behavior problems in cats when compared
 
07:06:13.990 --> 07:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
to a control controlled group of cats
 
07:06:16.070 --> 07:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
that have not been
 
07:06:19.310 --> 07:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
declawed one study found declawed cats
 
07:06:22.590 --> 07:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
were significantly un underrepresented
 
07:06:24.868 --> 07:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
in a Washington shelter Pro uh
 
07:06:27.548 --> 07:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
population when compared to estimates in
 
07:06:31.150 --> 07:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
the population at large there was no
 
07:06:33.868 --> 07:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
correlation between declawed status and
 
07:06:36.070 --> 07:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
use the nasia at the
 
07:06:38.990 --> 07:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
shelter in addition supporters of the
 
07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
procedures asserted that a properly
 
07:06:45.350 --> 07:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
performed declar is not no less Humane
 
07:06:47.190 --> 07:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
than spaying or
 
07:06:49.910 --> 07:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
neutering leaving a cat at a shelter may
 
07:06:52.628 --> 07:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
not be an option at all given the cost
 
07:06:56.350 --> 07:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
of surrender fees the long waiting list
 
07:06:58.310 --> 07:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the fact that shelters have no
 
07:07:00.868 --> 07:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
interest in handling an aggressive cat
 
07:07:00.878 --> 07:07:02.190 align:start position:0%
interest in handling an aggressive cat
for

07:07:02.190 --> 07:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:07:04.830 --> 07:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
rehoming do I believe there are people
 
07:07:06.868 --> 07:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
possibly even right in the hearing who
 
07:07:09.030 --> 07:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
think it is better to kill cats than
 
07:07:12.110 --> 07:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
declaw them yes I do again this is
 
07:07:14.430 --> 07:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
quotes from Nancy do I think that this
 
07:07:18.070 --> 07:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
is the right choice for everyone no I do
 
07:07:20.750 --> 07:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
not it is my belief that the studies
 
07:07:22.430 --> 07:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
prove that elimin ating the option of
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
declaring is very likely to result in
 
07:07:27.030 --> 07:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
more animal cruelty cases and higher
 
07:07:28.628 --> 07:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
rates of
 
07:07:31.230 --> 07:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
cats you see I'll say about putting them
 
07:07:35.150 --> 07:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
down you know putting a dog a cat down
 
07:07:37.548 --> 07:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
because it's you know they cannot get it
 
07:07:40.350 --> 07:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
to claw I'm sorry I don't you know and I
 
07:07:41.590 --> 07:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't like I said I don't have cats
 
07:07:44.230 --> 07:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
anymore but if that was the final Choice
 
07:07:46.510 --> 07:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I would do but I believe
 
07:07:47.990 --> 07:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
leaving the decision up to the
 
07:07:49.670 --> 07:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
veterinarians of New Hampshire and the
 
07:07:51.708 --> 07:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
owners of the animals in question
 
07:07:53.670 --> 07:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
Remains the best choice for onus and
 
07:07:56.910 --> 07:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
cats please vote this bill inexpedient
 
07:07:58.990 --> 07:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
to legislate and leave veterinarian
 
07:08:00.990 --> 07:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
medicine to the veterinarians and
 
07:08:03.150 --> 07:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
medical choices that let people keep
 
07:08:04.948 --> 07:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
their pets a viable
 
07:08:08.430 --> 07:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
option so that was Nancy Holmes thank
 
07:08:10.388 --> 07:08:10.398 align:start position:0%
you will you take any questions I could
 
07:08:13.070 --> 07:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
try but I'm not like I said I'm not fair
 
07:08:16.070 --> 07:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
enough representative comto could you
 
07:08:18.510 --> 07:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
pass up the written testimony when yeah
 
07:08:21.150 --> 07:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
I know it see that was an easy question
 
07:08:24.070 --> 07:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I can do that any other questions
 
07:08:26.670 --> 07:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
got my highlights on it so just want to
 
07:08:29.150 --> 07:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
point out all right seeing none we thank

today all right next up we're gonna have
 
07:08:40.788 --> 07:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:44.070 --> 07:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
hsus good afternoon and welcome to the
 
07:08:47.030 --> 07:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
ENA good afternoon Mr chairman me
 
07:08:49.190 --> 07:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Kurt
 
07:08:52.270 --> 07:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
aronberg I'm the uh state director for
 
07:08:54.310 --> 07:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
the Humane Society of the United States
 
07:08:55.230 --> 07:08:55.240 align:start position:0%

support of House Bill
1226

07:09:00.190 --> 07:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
1226
 
07:09:02.868 --> 07:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
um uh so before I start my prepared
 
07:09:04.910 --> 07:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
remarks I just want to make sure people
 
07:09:07.708 --> 07:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
understand declawing procedure is not
 
07:09:09.868 --> 07:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
pulling out the claw and it's not
 
07:09:11.628 --> 07:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
cutting the claw it's cutting the
 
07:09:13.468 --> 07:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
knuckle the
 
07:09:16.590 --> 07:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
bone generates the claw you need to
 
07:09:19.868 --> 07:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
remove the whole bone or the claw will
 
07:09:22.628 --> 07:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
continue to keep growing back there'll
 
07:09:25.150 --> 07:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
be a veterinarian testifying after me to
 
07:09:27.948 --> 07:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
verify or correct me in any way because
 
07:09:29.750 --> 07:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
I am not a veterinarian but it's
 
07:09:31.948 --> 07:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
important to
 
07:09:34.310 --> 07:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
remember it's it's kind of like if we
 
07:09:38.230 --> 07:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
took 25% of the children in the
 
07:09:42.310 --> 07:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
country and before they were school age
 
07:09:44.670 --> 07:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
you take the tops of their fingers and
 
07:09:47.468 --> 07:09:47.478 align:start position:0%
the top of their thumbs off of their
 
07:09:50.948 --> 07:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
hands without any choice and they live
 
07:09:53.548 --> 07:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
the rest of their life that way for
 
07:09:55.948 --> 07:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
better or worse think of yourself in
 
07:09:59.830 --> 07:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
that situation no choice wake up one day
 
07:10:01.830 --> 07:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
oh well I liked my fingers the way they
 
07:10:04.190 --> 07:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
were but now I have to live with them
 
07:10:04.200 --> 07:10:06.030 align:start position:0%
were but now I have to live with them
and

07:10:06.030 --> 07:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
adapt without those claws fingernails
 
07:10:11.150 --> 07:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
tips of the fingers I don't know I like
 
07:10:13.510 --> 07:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
to play the guitar I'm not a cat we're
 
07:10:15.788 --> 07:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
human beings but the other thing I would
 
07:10:19.310 --> 07:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
say that any veterinarian that speaks
 
07:10:22.110 --> 07:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
about human conditions in terms terms of
 
07:10:24.230 --> 07:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
resulting in scratches they're not human
 
07:10:26.388 --> 07:10:26.398 align:start position:0%
doctors we shouldn't consider their
 
07:10:29.590 --> 07:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
testimony as that um they're
 
07:10:33.868 --> 07:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
veterinarians um with that I will start
 
07:10:35.830 --> 07:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to be brief with my written
 
07:10:37.990 --> 07:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll also submit it for the
 
07:10:40.150 --> 07:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee sorry I couldn't get it to you
 
07:10:40.160 --> 07:10:42.750 align:start position:0%
committee sorry I couldn't get it to you
online

07:10:42.750 --> 07:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
online
 
07:10:45.310 --> 07:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
um uh the Humane Society the United
 
07:10:47.270 --> 07:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
States is the nation's largest Animal
 
07:10:49.510 --> 07:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
Protection Organization supports passage
 
07:10:51.990 --> 07:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill which would in the practice
 
07:10:55.350 --> 07:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
of non-therapeutic declawing or Den
 
07:10:58.830 --> 07:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
knuckling of cats in the state declawing
 
07:11:00.910 --> 07:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
has serious implications for feline
 
07:11:03.750 --> 07:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
welfare and the bond between people and
 
07:11:07.190 --> 07:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
their cats if Pass New Hampshire would
 
07:11:09.030 --> 07:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
joined a rapidly growing number of
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
communities taking a stand against this
 
07:11:11.040 --> 07:11:12.708 align:start position:0%

about here is non- therapeutic

decline the the owner chooses to do this
 
07:12:00.030 --> 07:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
so when you say you know we're going to
 
07:12:04.270 --> 07:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
Mu mutilate our our cat so we can love
 
07:12:08.868 --> 07:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make a lot of sense to me
 
07:12:11.750 --> 07:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the veterinary Community is
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%

many US Veterinary Schools no longer
 
07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
routinely teach declaw
 
07:13:03.430 --> 07:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
procedures however we cannot continue to
 
07:13:05.708 --> 07:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
wait for the veterinary profession to
 
07:13:08.548 --> 07:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
end declawing in this country on its
 
07:13:11.948 --> 07:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
own these amputations are still too
 
07:13:14.670 --> 07:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
commonly practiced and cat owners are
 
07:13:18.590 --> 07:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
often not made aware of the high risk of
 
07:13:22.150 --> 07:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
permanent adverse effects on C paths or
 
07:13:24.548 --> 07:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
of the procedures
 
07:13:27.628 --> 07:13:27.638 align:start position:0%
controversies and that you know even
 
07:13:29.708 --> 07:13:29.718 align:start position:0%
today is the responsibility of the
 
07:13:32.948 --> 07:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
veterinarian really to explain this uh
 
07:13:34.388 --> 07:13:34.398 align:start position:0%
to their
 
07:13:37.948 --> 07:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
clients that many veterinarians will not
 
07:13:40.590 --> 07:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
refuse to amputate a cat's toes which is
 
07:13:43.310 --> 07:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about unless there is
 
07:13:45.910 --> 07:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
a valid medical needs and by the way
 
07:13:49.270 --> 07:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about just cats just
 
07:13:54.190 --> 07:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:56.948 --> 07:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
cats arguments in favor of declawing
 
07:13:59.070 --> 07:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
often center around the desire to
 
07:14:01.750 --> 07:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
prevent unwanted scratching of either
 
07:14:03.510 --> 07:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
furniture or
 
07:14:06.628 --> 07:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
people well amputation is an extreme
 
07:14:08.868 --> 07:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
response to what can be addressed we
 
07:14:11.388 --> 07:14:11.398 align:start position:0%
heard with a squirt gun with regular
 
07:14:14.190 --> 07:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
nail trimming as we heard a variety of
 
07:14:15.990 --> 07:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
scratching posts and better
 
07:14:19.190 --> 07:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of feline Behavior better
 
07:14:21.110 --> 07:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of feline Behavior how
 
07:14:25.350 --> 07:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
about that moreover declawed cats are at
 
07:14:28.070 --> 07:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
a greater risk of developing more
 
07:14:30.430 --> 07:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
serious adverse
 
07:14:32.788 --> 07:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
behaviors not withstanding what any kind
 
07:14:36.030 --> 07:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
of anecdotal doal information you've
 
07:14:37.788 --> 07:14:37.798 align:start position:0%
heard here
 
07:14:41.190 --> 07:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
today adverse behaviors after amputation
 
07:14:44.070 --> 07:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
such as litterbox adversion or an
 
07:14:47.270 --> 07:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
increase in biting and
 
07:14:49.788 --> 07:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
aggression now in
 
07:14:49.798 --> 07:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
aggression now in
pain

07:14:52.150 --> 07:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
pain
 
07:14:54.350 --> 07:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
and no longer able to defend themselves
 
07:14:57.510 --> 07:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
with their claws cats May resort to
 
07:15:00.270 --> 07:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
biting the documented increased biting
 
07:15:02.350 --> 07:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
behavior of declawed cats can lead to
 
07:15:05.030 --> 07:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
more severe disease in people than cat
 
07:15:08.070 --> 07:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
scratches ask a human doctor about that
 
07:15:11.670 --> 07:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
not a vet or not somebody you talk to a
 
07:15:16.070 --> 07:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
vet but cat bites are
 
07:15:18.990 --> 07:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
serious scratches are another
 
07:15:21.830 --> 07:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
07:15:23.948 --> 07:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
so there is a false narrative here that
 
07:15:26.070 --> 07:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
cat owners unable to get their cats
 
07:15:28.310 --> 07:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
declawed are likely to relinquish their
 
07:15:30.590 --> 07:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
cats to animal shelters or abandon that
 
07:15:33.708 --> 07:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
cat Outdoors the risk of a cat ending up
 
07:15:35.910 --> 07:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
homeless or Worse euthanized due to
 
07:15:38.310 --> 07:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
declaw prohibition is grossly
 
07:15:40.708 --> 07:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
overestimated a recent study of data
 
07:15:43.350 --> 07:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
from British Columbia shelters covering
 
07:15:46.510 --> 07:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
the three years prior to and three years
 
07:15:49.670 --> 07:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
after a provincewide declaw ban went
 
07:15:51.708 --> 07:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
into effect showed that there was no
 
07:15:54.030 --> 07:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
increase in cats being relinquished or
 
07:15:55.948 --> 07:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
euthanized the number of owner
 
07:15:58.030 --> 07:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
surrendered cats actually decreased
 
07:16:00.750 --> 07:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
after the ban publicly available data
 
07:16:03.548 --> 07:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
from Los Angeles California also show no
 
07:16:06.910 --> 07:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
increase in cat intake at shelters
 
07:16:10.468 --> 07:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
Citywide once declawing was prohibited
 
07:16:12.670 --> 07:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
so the reality is that due to the higher
 
07:16:15.030 --> 07:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
prevalence of long-term adverse impacts
 
07:16:17.868 --> 07:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
of multiple amputations decline puts
 
07:16:20.230 --> 07:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
cats at a greater risk of eviction from
 
07:16:22.590 --> 07:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
their home homes and relin
 
07:16:26.110 --> 07:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
relinquishment to shelters and rescue
 
07:16:28.468 --> 07:16:28.478 align:start position:0%
organizations and according to a study
 
07:16:30.230 --> 07:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
published in the Journal of American
 
07:16:33.110 --> 07:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association among
 
07:16:35.150 --> 07:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
relinquished cats
 
07:16:38.510 --> 07:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
52% of declawed cats were reported to
 
07:16:42.190 --> 07:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
exhibit litterbox avoidance compared to
 
07:16:44.948 --> 07:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
29% of non declawed
 
07:16:49.510 --> 07:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
cats now declawing is not good for cats
 
07:16:51.948 --> 07:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
or people and it's time to end that
 
07:16:54.230 --> 07:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:16:56.590 --> 07:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for your
 
07:16:59.110 --> 07:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony any
 
07:17:00.750 --> 07:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Arenberg
 
07:17:00.760 --> 07:17:12.868 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Arenberg
representative

07:17:12.868 --> 07:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:15.310 --> 07:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
Bixby it's getting late and get to get a
 
07:17:19.548 --> 07:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
little spy so um our uh you had a list
 
07:17:22.750 --> 07:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
of states and uh that had uh have banned
 
07:17:26.230 --> 07:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
it I was wondering if Maine Vermont
 
07:17:28.590 --> 07:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh the New England states
 
07:17:30.468 --> 07:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
if is are there bands in any New England
 
07:17:32.270 --> 07:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
State in terms of a Statewide ban New
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
York state is currently the only state
 
07:17:38.468 --> 07:17:38.478 align:start position:0%
okay but there are so numerous other
 
07:17:40.830 --> 07:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
communities counties towns cities that
 
07:17:43.990 --> 07:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that have bed follow up uh do you happen
 
07:17:46.948 --> 07:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
to know what the rate of uh decline
 
07:17:49.468 --> 07:17:49.478 align:start position:0%
currently is in New Hampshire roughly
 
07:17:51.310 --> 07:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20
 
07:17:54.990 --> 07:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
25% okay thank you
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
declawing representative Murray thank
 
07:17:59.510 --> 07:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question and
 
07:18:01.110 --> 07:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
07:18:05.830 --> 07:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
curious if you could tell me um how many
 
07:18:07.310 --> 07:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously you mentioned New York
 
07:18:08.948 --> 07:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
state but how many other counties and
 
07:18:13.468 --> 07:18:13.478 align:start position:0%
states are using the penal system
 
07:18:15.150 --> 07:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
through misdemeanor charges versus
 
07:18:18.350 --> 07:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
license revocation or suspension as the
 
07:18:21.708 --> 07:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
method of enforcement
 
07:18:23.708 --> 07:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
I don't have an an answer for you but
 
07:18:25.548 --> 07:18:25.558 align:start position:0%

this anytime representative Aon thank
 
07:18:37.310 --> 07:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr shair and thank you for taking my
 
07:18:40.430 --> 07:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
question so I'm interested to know you
 
07:18:44.708 --> 07:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
just said that you uh the
 
07:18:48.868 --> 07:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
25% of uh cats are declawed in New
 
07:18:54.388 --> 07:18:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:58.350 --> 07:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
from I I I will stand by the figure
 
07:19:00.708 --> 07:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20 and 25 I can't give
 
07:19:02.990 --> 07:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
you a citation unfortunately right now
 
07:19:05.030 --> 07:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
because I can't remember exactly where
 
07:19:06.948 --> 07:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
I've heard that I'll stand by it as
 
07:19:10.948 --> 07:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
something I believe is true I also stand
 
07:19:13.388 --> 07:19:13.398 align:start position:0%
ready to be corrected that is a number
 
07:19:15.430 --> 07:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
that I believe is
 
07:19:18.910 --> 07:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
correct and there um there maybe someone
 
07:19:21.910 --> 07:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
here who can verify that
 
07:19:23.910 --> 07:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
I'll get it to you by the way is that
 
07:19:29.190 --> 07:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
based on observation of you or I mean
 
07:19:31.670 --> 07:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's based on it's based on a statistic
 
07:19:33.990 --> 07:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
that I believe is correct that I can't
 
07:19:36.310 --> 07:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
cite the source to you right now I'm
 
07:19:39.430 --> 07:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for that okay thank
 
07:19:42.868 --> 07:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
07:19:45.030 --> 07:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
comto thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
07:19:48.070 --> 07:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and this is along
 
07:19:50.628 --> 07:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
the lines of what representative just
 
07:19:53.430 --> 07:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
just asked um we keep batting around the
 
07:19:55.788 --> 07:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
number 20
 
07:19:59.830 --> 07:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
25% but in terms of actual numbers do we
 
07:20:01.708 --> 07:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
actually have a figure of the number of
 
07:20:03.670 --> 07:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
cats that are actually being declawed in
 
07:20:06.670 --> 07:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because percentages mean
 
07:20:08.590 --> 07:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
nothing when we don't know what the
 
07:20:11.230 --> 07:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
actual number is uh and there must be
 
07:20:13.430 --> 07:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
some database somewhere where we can get
 
07:20:15.270 --> 07:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
those figures
 
07:20:19.150 --> 07:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know the answer to
 
07:20:22.150 --> 07:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
that he any further
 
07:20:24.230 --> 07:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
07:20:26.750 --> 07:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
07:20:30.430 --> 07:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
you next we have Karen Campell Campbell
 
07:20:36.510 --> 07:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:40.830 --> 07:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
Epsom good afternoon and welcome to the
 
07:20:44.628 --> 07:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
ENA thank you thank you committee good
 
07:20:48.708 --> 07:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
to see you all um I'm Karen Campbell I'm
 
07:20:50.388 --> 07:20:50.398 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian in the state of New
 
07:20:52.468 --> 07:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm a specialist in
 
07:20:56.110 --> 07:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
Internal Medicine and um I'm a member of
 
07:20:57.788 --> 07:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
the Humane Society
 
07:21:00.670 --> 07:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
VMA and my husband is a veterinarian as
 
07:21:03.590 --> 07:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
well we were just uh reminiscing
 
07:21:06.868 --> 07:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
recently over when we learned the
 
07:21:09.708 --> 07:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
procedure of doing declaw on cats this
 
07:21:14.070 --> 07:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
was over 20 25 years ago um in my
 
07:21:16.590 --> 07:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
situation I was on a rotation where we
 
07:21:18.948 --> 07:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
learned to do spays and neuters and
 
07:21:21.788 --> 07:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
dentistry and decoy claw and we were
 
07:21:24.310 --> 07:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
taught by one instructor for three out
 
07:21:25.830 --> 07:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
of four of those things she didn't teach
 
07:21:28.948 --> 07:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
us the dclaw and the rumor that we heard
 
07:21:30.948 --> 07:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
through all of our classmates was it was
 
07:21:32.830 --> 07:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
because she didn't believe in it that
 
07:21:34.430 --> 07:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
she didn't think it was ethical and so
 
07:21:36.670 --> 07:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
she did not teach us that part of the
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
class when I learned to do the procedure
 
07:21:44.670 --> 07:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
I thought o this is brutal um and I also
 
07:21:49.230 --> 07:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
thought it seems very difficult um it's
 
07:21:50.670 --> 07:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually technically
 
07:21:53.590 --> 07:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
very challenging to do and in my catch
 
07:21:56.990 --> 07:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that I did the procedure on I had very
 
07:21:59.270 --> 07:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
serious concerns that I didn't know if I
 
07:22:01.110 --> 07:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
had done it well and that I didn't know
 
07:22:03.270 --> 07:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
if they would do well long term because
 
07:22:05.430 --> 07:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of times you don't know that you
 
07:22:08.070 --> 07:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
haven't done it well for weeks or months
 
07:22:12.628 --> 07:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
down the road um we were taught though
 
07:22:14.350 --> 07:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
that it was a core part of the
 
07:22:16.628 --> 07:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
curriculum and that it was helpful for
 
07:22:18.948 --> 07:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
the cat population in general because
 
07:22:20.788 --> 07:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
there were a certain percent of kitties
 
07:22:23.510 --> 07:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
that would um scratch furniture scratch
 
07:22:25.708 --> 07:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
their owners that kind of thing and they
 
07:22:27.628 --> 07:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make suitable pets for the
 
07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
household so I thought in the interest
 
07:22:32.230 --> 07:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the greater good you know I will
 
07:22:34.670 --> 07:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
learn to do this procedure if it helps
 
07:22:38.430 --> 07:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
cats stay in their home my husband he
 
07:22:40.350 --> 07:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
and two of his classmates that he's very
 
07:22:42.670 --> 07:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
good friends with they actually went to
 
07:22:45.788 --> 07:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
a shelter and adopted three cats and in
 
07:22:48.270 --> 07:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
their curriculum the way it was set up
 
07:22:50.548 --> 07:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
they were able then to spay a new those
 
07:22:51.948 --> 07:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
cats when they were learning how to do
 
07:22:53.990 --> 07:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
the surgeries and they were able to
 
07:22:57.190 --> 07:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
declaw them as well and not only did
 
07:23:00.750 --> 07:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
they declaw these three cats front feet
 
07:23:03.308 --> 07:23:03.318 align:start position:0%
they declawed the back feet too because
 
07:23:05.110 --> 07:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
they thought I'm trying to learn how to
 
07:23:06.990 --> 07:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
do this procedure I want to be a really
 
07:23:08.948 --> 07:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
good veterinarian this is core something
 
07:23:11.110 --> 07:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
I need to know how to do so those were
 
07:23:12.628 --> 07:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
going to be indoor cats that they were
 
07:23:14.510 --> 07:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
keeping and so they decco all four of
 
07:23:18.230 --> 07:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
their feet now fast forward 20 years
 
07:23:22.070 --> 07:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
later my husband is a a uh Veterinary
 
07:23:24.308 --> 07:23:24.318 align:start position:0%
Hospital owner in the state of New
 
07:23:26.468 --> 07:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and since he's the owner he
 
07:23:28.628 --> 07:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
gets to decide what is and what is not
 
07:23:31.590 --> 07:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
done at his practice and they don't
 
07:23:33.350 --> 07:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
allow the declaw they don't do the
 
07:23:36.830 --> 07:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
procedure because he thinks that it's
 
07:23:39.830 --> 07:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
unethical so our personal feelings have
 
07:23:42.150 --> 07:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
changed about the procedure and that's
 
07:23:45.670 --> 07:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
because over the 2025 years we've gotten
 
07:23:47.868 --> 07:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
more data about what happens to these
 
07:23:50.548 --> 07:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
kites long term and we're no longer in
 
07:23:53.670 --> 07:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
favor of it um the procedure hasn't
 
07:23:57.070 --> 07:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
changed it's still brutal it still is an
 
07:24:01.468 --> 07:24:01.478 align:start position:0%
actual amputation of all 10 of the cat's
 
07:24:03.990 --> 07:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
digits um and I'm sort of you know
 
07:24:06.708 --> 07:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
demonstrating with my own hands it's a
 
07:24:09.150 --> 07:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
little bit worse even in a cat because
 
07:24:10.830 --> 07:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
their hands so to speak you know they
 
07:24:13.590 --> 07:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
walk on so then they're walking on top
 
07:24:16.830 --> 07:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
of 10 amputated digits and so that can
 
07:24:20.350 --> 07:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
be painful and it turns out it is hard
 
07:24:21.430 --> 07:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
to do
 
07:24:24.548 --> 07:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
correctly um most of the papers that I
 
07:24:28.468 --> 07:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
have seen there's about a 25 to 30% rate
 
07:24:31.308 --> 07:24:31.318 align:start position:0%
of complications which is a pretty high
 
07:24:33.948 --> 07:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
complication rate in an animal where
 
07:24:35.468 --> 07:24:35.478 align:start position:0%
their limbs were perfectly healthy to
 
07:24:37.190 --> 07:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
begin with there's nothing wrong with
 
07:24:39.388 --> 07:24:39.398 align:start position:0%
them and it's completely elective
 
07:24:41.230 --> 07:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
surgery it's not for the benefit of the
 
07:24:46.670 --> 07:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
cat at all um it's hard to do because
 
07:24:48.670 --> 07:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
you would kind of expect that these
 
07:24:50.110 --> 07:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
bones are straight in the end and you
 
07:24:52.270 --> 07:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
just cut in between them but that's not
 
07:24:54.388 --> 07:24:54.398 align:start position:0%
the case they're they're a curved end
 
07:24:57.190 --> 07:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
and they are curved to fit each other
 
07:24:58.708 --> 07:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
and so when you're trying to do the
 
07:25:00.670 --> 07:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
procedure you're having this little
 
07:25:02.868 --> 07:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
blade trying to go into this very tiny
 
07:25:05.070 --> 07:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
space that's curved and make your way
 
07:25:07.750 --> 07:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
around all of these little curves and
 
07:25:09.708 --> 07:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
not damage the bone that you're trying
 
07:25:12.990 --> 07:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
to leave behind make sure you do remove
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
all the bone that you're trying to
 
07:25:16.830 --> 07:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
remove cut the tendons that are
 
07:25:19.150 --> 07:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate not cut the other tendons
 
07:25:21.230 --> 07:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
that aren't appropri roate you end up
 
07:25:23.190 --> 07:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
cutting nerves and sometimes you have
 
07:25:25.830 --> 07:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
permanent nerve damage from that and
 
07:25:27.910 --> 07:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to do and that's why
 
07:25:30.190 --> 07:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
there's such a high complication rate
 
07:25:31.670 --> 07:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
you can
 
07:25:34.110 --> 07:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
have cut the bone that you didn't want
 
07:25:36.270 --> 07:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
to the bone that you did want to
 
07:25:37.750 --> 07:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
completely remove you can leave a little
 
07:25:39.948 --> 07:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
fragment behind and then when you do
 
07:25:41.750 --> 07:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
that little fragment will sit underneath
 
07:25:43.350 --> 07:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
this other bone so it's like you're
 
07:25:46.110 --> 07:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
walking on a pubble all the time there's
 
07:25:48.110 --> 07:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
a pretty high rate of infections
 
07:25:50.350 --> 07:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
abscesses draining tracts so they get
 
07:25:54.990 --> 07:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
infected a lot um if this tendon on the
 
07:25:57.548 --> 07:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
bottom is left intact but the one on top
 
07:26:00.388 --> 07:26:00.398 align:start position:0%
is not the digit that remains it will
 
07:26:03.030 --> 07:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
pull it underneath and so the the cat
 
07:26:05.990 --> 07:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
ends up walking sort of like this on top
 
07:26:09.510 --> 07:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
of a bent toe and then it will cause the
 
07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
pad that's underneath the foot to
 
07:26:13.548 --> 07:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
retract back and so now they're not even
 
07:26:15.030 --> 07:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
walking on their pad they're just
 
07:26:18.030 --> 07:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
walking on skin instead of the pad
 
07:26:21.350 --> 07:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
itself um you all should know probably
 
07:26:23.468 --> 07:26:23.478 align:start position:0%
anytime anybody suffers any kind of an
 
07:26:25.708 --> 07:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
injury and you're painful somewhere
 
07:26:27.830 --> 07:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to offload your weight and
 
07:26:29.590 --> 07:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
and shift it some other part of your
 
07:26:32.030 --> 07:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
body and Studies have shown that that
 
07:26:35.190 --> 07:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
happens with the cats and that they uh
 
07:26:37.430 --> 07:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
then develop higher rates of arthritis
 
07:26:39.590 --> 07:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
in other parts of their body after
 
07:26:41.750 --> 07:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
they've been declawed and they have
 
07:26:43.670 --> 07:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
higher rates of back
 
07:26:47.548 --> 07:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
pain um behaviorally it's not good for
 
07:26:50.628 --> 07:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
them as well they have scent glands on
 
07:26:52.230 --> 07:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom of their feet that they mark
 
07:26:54.670 --> 07:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
their territory with and if their feet
 
07:26:56.110 --> 07:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
are not comfortable and they don't feel
 
07:26:57.628 --> 07:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
like marking anymore with their scent
 
07:26:59.750 --> 07:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
glands unfortunately for homeowners they
 
07:27:02.190 --> 07:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
can Mark people's houses with their
 
07:27:05.308 --> 07:27:05.318 align:start position:0%
urine they uh normally like to stretch
 
07:27:06.910 --> 07:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
and then when they stretch they stretch
 
07:27:09.910 --> 07:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
their claws they like to scratch their
 
07:27:12.468 --> 07:27:12.478 align:start position:0%
claws to keep them nice and sharp and
 
07:27:15.030 --> 07:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
they use their claws for defense and so
 
07:27:17.788 --> 07:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
when they don't have these behaviors
 
07:27:20.308 --> 07:27:20.318 align:start position:0%
that they can exhibit anymore a lot of
 
07:27:23.190 --> 07:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
the kitties become irritable and they
 
07:27:26.110 --> 07:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
are more likely to bite um more Studies
 
07:27:28.548 --> 07:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
have shown that decla cats are more
 
07:27:30.750 --> 07:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
likely to bite than cats that are not
 
07:27:34.830 --> 07:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
declaw and then lastly it is also true
 
07:27:37.230 --> 07:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
that more cats who've been declawed
 
07:27:39.548 --> 07:27:39.558 align:start position:0%
don't use the litter pan because their
 
07:27:41.910 --> 07:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
feet hurt they may be comfortable enough
 
07:27:44.830 --> 07:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
to walk around on carpet and uh beds and
 
07:27:46.708 --> 07:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
couches and things like that but when
 
07:27:48.868 --> 07:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
they get on that sharp irregular Rocky
 
07:27:50.350 --> 07:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
kind of litter they don't like it and so
 
07:27:52.430 --> 07:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
they'll urinate outside the
 
07:27:56.430 --> 07:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
pan so an important
 
07:27:56.440 --> 07:27:58.150 align:start position:0%
pan so an important
question

07:27:58.150 --> 07:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:28:00.548 --> 07:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
until probably within the past five
 
07:28:02.430 --> 07:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
years or so has
 
07:28:05.548 --> 07:28:05.558 align:start position:0%
been but can they be acceptable pets you
 
07:28:07.830 --> 07:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
know what is the overall good for cats
 
07:28:11.708 --> 07:28:11.718 align:start position:0%
and cat owners if we don't allow
 
07:28:13.948 --> 07:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
decline um how many cats are going to be
 
07:28:16.230 --> 07:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
relinquished back to shelters and I say
 
07:28:19.708 --> 07:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
the past five years or so because the um
 
07:28:22.388 --> 07:28:22.398 align:start position:0%
the state of New York and the cities
 
07:28:23.830 --> 07:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
that have been referenced and the
 
07:28:25.590 --> 07:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
provinces in Canada that have been
 
07:28:28.510 --> 07:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
referenced that have banned declawing
 
07:28:30.030 --> 07:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
have largely done it within the past
 
07:28:32.110 --> 07:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
five years or so and that's allowed for
 
07:28:34.670 --> 07:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
the studies to be done to see what are
 
07:28:37.830 --> 07:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
the relinquishment rates in those areas
 
07:28:40.868 --> 07:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
after those declaw banss have gone into
 
07:28:44.788 --> 07:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
effect and uh not every single area has
 
07:28:47.070 --> 07:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
been studied but all of the studies that
 
07:28:48.830 --> 07:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
I have seen have shown the
 
07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
relinquishment rate does not go up and
 
07:28:54.230 --> 07:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
in some cases it actually goes down and
 
07:28:56.708 --> 07:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
that makes sense because if you have
 
07:29:00.150 --> 07:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
declawed cats biting more and soiling
 
07:29:03.030 --> 07:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
the house more they're more likely to be
 
07:29:04.708 --> 07:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
turned back into the
 
07:29:07.948 --> 07:29:07.958 align:start position:0%
shelter so because of all this
 
07:29:09.750 --> 07:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
additional information that has been
 
07:29:12.308 --> 07:29:12.318 align:start position:0%
obtained over the past 20 years you know
 
07:29:13.830 --> 07:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have the same attitude I did
 
07:29:15.830 --> 07:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
before well for the greater good I'm I'm
 
07:29:17.948 --> 07:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
in favor of this procedure now I support
 
07:29:20.230 --> 07:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
Banning the decline
 
07:29:21.830 --> 07:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's better for the cats
 
07:29:25.030 --> 07:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
physically it's better for them mentally
 
07:29:27.910 --> 07:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to be better for pet owners in
 
07:29:29.830 --> 07:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
statistically they keep their cats
 
07:29:31.990 --> 07:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
longer and then it would be better for
 
07:29:33.670 --> 07:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well because they
 
07:29:35.270 --> 07:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to deal with as many cats
 
07:29:38.110 --> 07:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
being turned into shelters and trying to
 
07:29:40.590 --> 07:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
rehome them take care of them while
 
07:29:43.030 --> 07:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're in the shelter or pay for Ethan
 
07:29:46.308 --> 07:29:46.318 align:start position:0%
Asia so those are my current thoughts
 
07:29:48.990 --> 07:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to entertain any questions all
 
07:29:50.388 --> 07:29:50.398 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
07:29:53.430 --> 07:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh representative Bixby yes
 
07:29:56.990 --> 07:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
07:30:00.110 --> 07:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm curious about how common The
 
07:30:03.110 --> 07:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
Practice still is because I we we we get
 
07:30:06.430 --> 07:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
this rate of 20 to 25% C of cats being
 
07:30:09.230 --> 07:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
declawed but I'm not sure if that means
 
07:30:14.030 --> 07:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
that 25 that that percentage of new cats
 
07:30:16.350 --> 07:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
are newly owned cats are being declawed
 
07:30:18.628 --> 07:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
or whether that is a residual from when
 
07:30:20.830 --> 07:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
it was a more common practice and cats
 
07:30:26.150 --> 07:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
live 15 years or so uh so do how how
 
07:30:28.230 --> 07:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
common is that practice in New Hampshire
 
07:30:30.308 --> 07:30:30.318 align:start position:0%
right now yeah the the problem for you
 
07:30:33.468 --> 07:30:33.478 align:start position:0%
guys is there's a scarcity of this data
 
07:30:36.350 --> 07:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
um the number 20 to 25% that is thrown
 
07:30:39.230 --> 07:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
around is from some fairly recent
 
07:30:41.990 --> 07:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
studies within the past five years or so
 
07:30:43.788 --> 07:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
but they're National studies or their
 
07:30:46.548 --> 07:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
studies in other states I don't know of
 
07:30:48.548 --> 07:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
any data in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:30:52.030 --> 07:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
honestly I know that the New Hampshire
 
07:30:54.948 --> 07:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
VMA because I'm a member of them sent
 
07:30:56.070 --> 07:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
out a
 
07:30:59.388 --> 07:30:59.398 align:start position:0%
survey a month or so ago prior to this
 
07:31:02.670 --> 07:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
hearing asking veterinarians four or
 
07:31:04.708 --> 07:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
five simple questions about declawing
 
07:31:06.510 --> 07:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
you know do we do them how often do we
 
07:31:09.070 --> 07:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
do them how do we feel about them you
 
07:31:11.868 --> 07:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing so I know that
 
07:31:14.110 --> 07:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
they have gathered that data I don't
 
07:31:15.750 --> 07:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
know what the results were they haven't
 
07:31:18.308 --> 07:31:18.318 align:start position:0%
published them and I do know that about
 
07:31:20.990 --> 07:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
40% of veterinarians in the state are
 
07:31:23.628 --> 07:31:23.638 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire VMA so even
 
07:31:25.510 --> 07:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
whatever data they've gotten it's only
 
07:31:27.750 --> 07:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
from 40% or less of the
 
07:31:30.270 --> 07:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarians so I honestly feel like
 
07:31:32.910 --> 07:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
nobody really knows the answer to that
 
07:31:34.708 --> 07:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
07:31:38.190 --> 07:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Aaron thank you Mr
 
07:31:39.788 --> 07:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
07:31:41.350 --> 07:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and thank you for taking
 
07:31:43.990 --> 07:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
07:31:48.468 --> 07:31:48.478 align:start position:0%
so is there any do do veterinarians
 
07:31:50.990 --> 07:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
report to any
 
07:31:55.388 --> 07:31:55.398 align:start position:0%
body um the types of uh procedures that
 
07:32:00.468 --> 07:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
they do no no okay thank
 
07:32:03.230 --> 07:32:03.240 align:start position:0%

07:32:05.670 --> 07:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
questions see none we'll thank you for
 
07:32:18.230 --> 07:32:18.240 align:start position:0%

conquer hello everyone good afternoon
 
07:32:37.868 --> 07:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
welcome to Thea thank you for allowing
 
07:32:39.750 --> 07:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
me to testify um again my name is
 
07:32:41.510 --> 07:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
Michelle fransen Conroy I live in
 
07:32:43.910 --> 07:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
Conquer New Hampshire um I am here
 
07:32:46.110 --> 07:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
representing myself but I will let you
 
07:32:47.708 --> 07:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
know that I'm on the board of the New
 
07:32:49.948 --> 07:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire animal rights League
 
07:32:53.270 --> 07:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
and I um went to UNH Thompson school
 
07:32:55.270 --> 07:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s I have an associates
 
07:32:57.910 --> 07:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
degree in uh animal science specializing
 
07:33:01.388 --> 07:33:01.398 align:start position:0%
in Small Animal Care and I have worked
 
07:33:04.308 --> 07:33:04.318 align:start position:0%
at numerous animal shelters and animal
 
07:33:07.030 --> 07:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I'm just here to give you
 
07:33:10.670 --> 07:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
a Viewpoint a firsthand account of um
 
07:33:12.868 --> 07:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
what happens to some cats after right
 
07:33:15.230 --> 07:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
after the surgery I won't mention the
 
07:33:16.788 --> 07:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
name of the animal hospital I worked at
 
07:33:18.750 --> 07:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
but it's local in Conquer New Hampshire
 
07:33:21.468 --> 07:33:21.478 align:start position:0%
and this was was back in the early '90s
 
07:33:25.190 --> 07:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I was in surgery assisting with some
 
07:33:27.590 --> 07:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the veterinarians for the procedures
 
07:33:29.910 --> 07:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
and taking care of the um cats
 
07:33:31.948 --> 07:33:31.958 align:start position:0%
afterwards and was out back you know
 
07:33:33.868 --> 07:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
cleaning cages and things so I would see
 
07:33:36.190 --> 07:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
the cats as they're coming out of the
 
07:33:38.388 --> 07:33:38.398 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and it was just horrible to
 
07:33:40.548 --> 07:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
watch when the anesthesia was wearing
 
07:33:43.350 --> 07:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
off they had bandages on them all the
 
07:33:45.150 --> 07:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
way you know the whole length of their
 
07:33:47.670 --> 07:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
arm and they would just be howling in
 
07:33:50.270 --> 07:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
pain and like flailing around in the
 
07:33:52.708 --> 07:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
cages and a lot of them would manage to
 
07:33:54.670 --> 07:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
get the bandages off and there would be
 
07:33:56.990 --> 07:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
blood all over the inside of the cage
 
07:33:58.670 --> 07:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
they would have to take the cat
 
07:34:00.910 --> 07:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
rebandage it a lot of times it would
 
07:34:03.430 --> 07:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
happen again same thing same cat would
 
07:34:04.910 --> 07:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
end up getting the bandages off just
 
07:34:07.590 --> 07:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
trying to rid themselves of that and
 
07:34:10.230 --> 07:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
just dealing in with the agony of having
 
07:34:12.670 --> 07:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
that procedure done to them I personally
 
07:34:14.910 --> 07:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a declawed cat I've adopted
 
07:34:17.830 --> 07:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
many cats rescued cats none of them have
 
07:34:20.750 --> 07:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
been de been de clawed so I don't have
 
07:34:23.750 --> 07:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience with them after that all of
 
07:34:25.708 --> 07:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
my cats I just clip their nails if you
 
07:34:27.990 --> 07:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
start when they're little I hold my cat
 
07:34:29.788 --> 07:34:29.798 align:start position:0%
upside down like a baby and just poke
 
07:34:31.388 --> 07:34:31.398 align:start position:0%
the nail out and just take the tip of it
 
07:34:33.990 --> 07:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
off and you just get them used to doing
 
07:34:36.388 --> 07:34:36.398 align:start position:0%
that on a normal thing and their treat
 
07:34:38.150 --> 07:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
that I give them is catnip which they
 
07:34:40.350 --> 07:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely love and they only get catnip
 
07:34:44.070 --> 07:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
after I do their nails so um that's
 
07:34:46.230 --> 07:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
their incentive and for them to allow me
 
07:34:48.628 --> 07:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
to cut their nails um so it's very easy
 
07:34:51.350 --> 07:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
to manage that way but um I just I
 
07:34:54.788 --> 07:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
hadn't heard anybody speak about what
 
07:34:58.308 --> 07:34:58.318 align:start position:0%
happens and have anybody show you um or
 
07:35:00.590 --> 07:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
explain to you the after effects right
 
07:35:02.110 --> 07:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
after their surgery but it was just
 
07:35:05.388 --> 07:35:05.398 align:start position:0%
horrible to watch and I think it was a
 
07:35:06.910 --> 07:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
big money maker I don't know if this
 
07:35:08.830 --> 07:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
Animal Hospital still declaw because
 
07:35:11.030 --> 07:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
like I said this was back in the 90s but
 
07:35:13.750 --> 07:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of cats and I think you
 
07:35:14.868 --> 07:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
know that was a good part of the
 
07:35:17.548 --> 07:35:17.558 align:start position:0%
business MoneyWise was performing this
 
07:35:19.270 --> 07:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
procedure but it was just hor horrible
 
07:35:22.030 --> 07:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
to watch those cats go through that um
 
07:35:23.910 --> 07:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of the anesthesia with with
 
07:35:26.150 --> 07:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
the blood everywhere and I I'll never
 
07:35:30.308 --> 07:35:30.318 align:start position:0%
forget it so I just wanted to share that
 
07:35:32.468 --> 07:35:32.478 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't know if anybody has
 
07:35:34.788 --> 07:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
any questions or Mr
 
07:35:38.308 --> 07:35:38.318 align:start position:0%
sh sorry about that uh any
 
07:35:41.308 --> 07:35:41.318 align:start position:0%
questions representative Aaron thank you
 
07:35:43.388 --> 07:35:43.398 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for coming and giving
 
07:35:45.030 --> 07:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
07:35:47.388 --> 07:35:47.398 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I'm interested to know what
 
07:35:50.150 --> 07:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
you feel about the
 
07:35:54.030 --> 07:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
um uh the penalty for declawing in this
 
07:35:57.788 --> 07:35:57.798 align:start position:0%
bill that um calls for Class B
 
07:36:00.628 --> 07:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I can't really speak to that
 
07:36:02.628 --> 07:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
I I didn't really take a look at that
 
07:36:05.430 --> 07:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
part of the language I I did email my
 
07:36:08.270 --> 07:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
testimony also um I didn't know that
 
07:36:10.510 --> 07:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
that was actually part of it until I got
 
07:36:14.270 --> 07:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
here and read that so um I really can't
 
07:36:16.548 --> 07:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
speak to the that part of it thank you
 
07:36:20.430 --> 07:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry any further questions
 
07:36:23.308 --> 07:36:23.318 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your
 
07:36:25.788 --> 07:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
testimony next up we have uh Angela
 
07:36:30.868 --> 07:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:34.628 --> 07:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
estate welcome back again thank you
 
07:36:37.948 --> 07:36:37.958 align:start position:0%
all so as mentioned previously I'm here
 
07:36:39.590 --> 07:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of dog owners of the Granite
 
07:36:42.270 --> 07:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
State but we do have a large number of
 
07:36:44.708 --> 07:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
cat owners and breeders as part of our
 
07:36:51.030 --> 07:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
membership um we oppose hb22 six and for
 
07:36:53.910 --> 07:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
many reasons most of them revolve around
 
07:36:56.030 --> 07:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is something that
 
07:36:57.708 --> 07:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
should be determined between a
 
07:37:00.910 --> 07:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and an owner um even going
 
07:37:03.030 --> 07:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
back and looking at some documentation
 
07:37:05.590 --> 07:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
from the avma while they discourage
 
07:37:07.788 --> 07:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
decline they also respect the
 
07:37:09.788 --> 07:37:09.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's right to use professional
 
07:37:11.990 --> 07:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
judgment when deciding how to best
 
07:37:13.830 --> 07:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
protect their individual patients Health
 
07:37:13.840 --> 07:37:14.548 align:start position:0%
protect their individual patients Health
and

07:37:14.548 --> 07:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:37:18.190 --> 07:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
Welfare we agree uh with them and always
 
07:37:20.230 --> 07:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
recommend working with an animal to curb
 
07:37:22.110 --> 07:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
bad behaviors before turning to a
 
07:37:24.468 --> 07:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
medical procedure however when
 
07:37:26.548 --> 07:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
everything else fails and a veterinarian
 
07:37:28.510 --> 07:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
determines that decline is the only
 
07:37:31.150 --> 07:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
remaining solution that choice should
 
07:37:33.308 --> 07:37:33.318 align:start position:0%
remain between the veterinarian and the
 
07:37:33.318 --> 07:37:34.510 align:start position:0%
remain between the veterinarian and the
pet

07:37:34.510 --> 07:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
pet
 
07:37:37.110 --> 07:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
owner somebody had mentioned earlier
 
07:37:39.230 --> 07:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
that veterinarians aren't held to any
 
07:37:41.548 --> 07:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
standards as far as what they are
 
07:37:44.190 --> 07:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
allowed and supposed to do um with the
 
07:37:46.110 --> 07:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
animals that they treat and I just
 
07:37:48.788 --> 07:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to read a section of the
 
07:37:52.150 --> 07:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians oath from the avma
 
07:37:54.788 --> 07:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
website it says that being admitted to
 
07:37:56.990 --> 07:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
the profession of veterinary medicine I
 
07:37:59.070 --> 07:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
solemnly swear to use my scientific
 
07:38:01.070 --> 07:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skills for the benefit of
 
07:38:03.350 --> 07:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
society through the protection of Animal
 
07:38:06.030 --> 07:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Welfare the prevention and
 
07:38:08.150 --> 07:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
relief of animal suffering the
 
07:38:10.590 --> 07:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
conservation of animal resources the
 
07:38:12.230 --> 07:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
promotion of Public Health and the
 
07:38:14.548 --> 07:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
advancement of medical knowledge there's
 
07:38:16.270 --> 07:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more to it but that was the
 
07:38:19.070 --> 07:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
one that I felt really hit home um um
 
07:38:24.070 --> 07:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill and the ability to have a
 
07:38:26.830 --> 07:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian maintain that oath and
 
07:38:30.590 --> 07:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
treat animals as they see fit with the
 
07:38:32.910 --> 07:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh information coming from the
 
07:38:35.548 --> 07:38:35.558 align:start position:0%
owners um one of our members actually
 
07:38:37.628 --> 07:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
called Eight veterinarian offices this
 
07:38:40.110 --> 07:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
week and half of them said that they do
 
07:38:42.830 --> 07:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
not offer the procedure so we don't feel
 
07:38:45.708 --> 07:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
that this is very popular uh in New
 
07:38:48.230 --> 07:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here those that will do it say
 
07:38:49.670 --> 07:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they try to discourage the
 
07:38:52.388 --> 07:38:52.398 align:start position:0%
procedure and offer Alternatives and a
 
07:38:54.350 --> 07:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
couple of the veterinarian offices who
 
07:38:57.548 --> 07:38:57.558 align:start position:0%
have performed the procedure related to
 
07:38:59.548 --> 07:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
our member that it was done to support
 
07:39:01.230 --> 07:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
the health of the owner who was on blood
 
07:39:03.270 --> 07:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
thinners um so that they wouldn't have
 
07:39:06.308 --> 07:39:06.318 align:start position:0%
to relinquish the animal or have to give
 
07:39:08.430 --> 07:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
it up to a shelter in order to keep
 
07:39:11.430 --> 07:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
their health safe um and as we just
 
07:39:14.910 --> 07:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
heard um from Miss Campbell I believe
 
07:39:17.548 --> 07:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
her name was that vets can choose to not
 
07:39:19.750 --> 07:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
do the surgery as her practice has done
 
07:39:22.190 --> 07:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
so so I do think that it's something
 
07:39:25.070 --> 07:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian field can make
 
07:39:27.990 --> 07:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
decisions about in our state rather than
 
07:39:30.430 --> 07:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
being forced down on them from
 
07:39:34.070 --> 07:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
government um on a side note I did have
 
07:39:35.628 --> 07:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
a cat that was declawed when I was
 
07:39:38.910 --> 07:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
growing up and he was a wonderful cat he
 
07:39:41.468 --> 07:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
could still climb trees he was a pretty
 
07:39:44.030 --> 07:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
avid chipmunk Hunter um and would always
 
07:39:45.628 --> 07:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
try and bring little mice into the house
 
07:39:48.868 --> 07:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
that he would catch and temperamentally
 
07:39:51.070 --> 07:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
physically everything he was very
 
07:39:52.670 --> 07:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
healthy and a great cat we didn't have
 
07:39:56.070 --> 07:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
any adverse effects from it um so while
 
07:39:59.230 --> 07:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
I think with any procedure or surgery
 
07:40:01.708 --> 07:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
there are going to be situations where
 
07:40:04.590 --> 07:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
things don't go as well as planned there
 
07:40:07.150 --> 07:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
are times and probably more often than
 
07:40:10.708 --> 07:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
not with decline that it is truly to the
 
07:40:13.868 --> 07:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of the animal and their owners
 
07:40:16.468 --> 07:40:16.478 align:start position:0%
um if you look at spay and neuter that's
 
07:40:18.910 --> 07:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
something that we do that is extremely
 
07:40:22.230 --> 07:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
invasive we do it for convenience um it
 
07:40:24.468 --> 07:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of issues it can increase
 
07:40:26.708 --> 07:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
cancers it can create
 
07:40:28.548 --> 07:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
incontinance um you can have
 
07:40:30.948 --> 07:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
temperamental problems if it is done too
 
07:40:34.110 --> 07:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
early as the males age and different
 
07:40:35.590 --> 07:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
things like that but that isn't
 
07:40:37.308 --> 07:40:37.318 align:start position:0%
something that you're going to see the
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
others coming in here and asking you to
 
07:40:41.468 --> 07:40:41.478 align:start position:0%
prevent veterinarians from being able to
 
07:40:44.430 --> 07:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
do so I think it's important uh that we
 
07:40:46.110 --> 07:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
let the veterinarians continue to
 
07:40:48.628 --> 07:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
educate their clients about decline and
 
07:40:50.230 --> 07:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
not make anyone a criminal when they
 
07:40:53.030 --> 07:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
feel it's best to perform the procedure
 
07:40:54.788 --> 07:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to take any
 
07:40:57.070 --> 07:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
07:40:59.590 --> 07:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
Miss farar yes representative uh thank
 
07:41:01.910 --> 07:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question again I would
 
07:41:03.910 --> 07:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
ask how many dogs have you seen that
 
07:41:08.230 --> 07:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
have been declawed dogs dogs um I am not
 
07:41:10.910 --> 07:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody that actually declaws
 
07:41:14.150 --> 07:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
dogs the only time I've ever heard of it
 
07:41:17.510 --> 07:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not based on any stat statistic
 
07:41:19.548 --> 07:41:19.558 align:start position:0%
but it was usually like drug dealers or
 
07:41:21.070 --> 07:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
something that didn't want the police to
 
07:41:23.308 --> 07:41:23.318 align:start position:0%
hear the dogs running down the Halls can
 
07:41:26.868 --> 07:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
I follow follow up why do you think that
 
07:41:30.990 --> 07:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
is because dogs destroy furniture and
 
07:41:35.070 --> 07:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
they also scratch people so why are cats
 
07:41:37.350 --> 07:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
subjected to this but not
 
07:41:40.150 --> 07:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
dogs this would just be based on my own
 
07:41:44.270 --> 07:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts but um dogs tend to be more
 
07:41:46.430 --> 07:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
destructive with their mouths chewing on
 
07:41:48.468 --> 07:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
things than they're going to be with
 
07:41:52.308 --> 07:41:52.318 align:start position:0%
line um their claws are or their nails
 
07:41:54.910 --> 07:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
are much more dense and not as sharp if
 
07:41:56.788 --> 07:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
you look at a cat's nail and comparison
 
07:42:00.110 --> 07:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
to a dog's nail it is like a hook um so
 
07:42:02.510 --> 07:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't keep those Nails on the cat
 
07:42:05.230 --> 07:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
trimmed back very short um they're
 
07:42:08.590 --> 07:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
extremely sharp even just touching you
 
07:42:10.430 --> 07:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can cut right into you
 
07:42:13.110 --> 07:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
dog nails they're much thicker more
 
07:42:15.628 --> 07:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
dense um and generally not going to be
 
07:42:17.350 --> 07:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
sharp and be as
 
07:42:17.360 --> 07:42:19.590 align:start position:0%
sharp and be as
destructive

07:42:19.590 --> 07:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
destructive
 
07:42:22.030 --> 07:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
07:42:24.110 --> 07:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your

um to the committee from the avma as
 
07:43:32.190 --> 07:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
well and I'll make sure that that gets
 
07:43:35.910 --> 07:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
to you chair um in opposition to this
 
07:43:38.708 --> 07:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:41.708 --> 07:43:41.718 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Veterinary Medical Association
 
07:43:45.548 --> 07:43:45.558 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to this
 
07:43:48.548 --> 07:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
legislation for all the reasons that
 
07:43:50.270 --> 07:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
other people have already mentioned that
 
07:43:54.430 --> 07:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to it um our main goal is
 
07:43:56.868 --> 07:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
to maintain the veterinary patient
 
07:44:01.030 --> 07:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
client relationship the vprc and we feel
 
07:44:03.308 --> 07:44:03.318 align:start position:0%
that that is our best asset and our best
 
07:44:08.230 --> 07:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
tool to perform um to our best of our
 
07:44:11.350 --> 07:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
abilities we do not feel that this
 
07:44:12.990 --> 07:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
should be a
 
07:44:14.948 --> 07:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
legislated event it should not be
 
07:44:16.388 --> 07:44:16.398 align:start position:0%
medical procedures in the veterinary
 
07:44:17.830 --> 07:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
Community should not be a legislated
 
07:44:17.840 --> 07:44:19.150 align:start position:0%
Community should not be a legislated
thing

07:44:19.150 --> 07:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
thing
 
07:44:23.030 --> 07:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
but let me be abundantly clear we do not
 
07:44:26.430 --> 07:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
promote declaw we follow the tenants and
 
07:44:28.948 --> 07:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
the position statement of the avma which
 
07:44:32.430 --> 07:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
discourages decline we also follow the
 
07:44:34.468 --> 07:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
American animal he Hospital
 
07:44:37.070 --> 07:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
association's position statement aafp
 
07:44:40.590 --> 07:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
American Association of Veterinary uh
 
07:44:43.110 --> 07:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
feline practitioners um and I do have
 
07:44:45.030 --> 07:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
copies of those uh position statements
 
07:44:47.628 --> 07:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
if you would um so choose to have those
 
07:44:49.590 --> 07:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
and again those position statements they
 
07:44:52.070 --> 07:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
do not promote declaw they give other
 
07:44:55.230 --> 07:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
options for the management of Claws and
 
07:44:57.708 --> 07:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
the destructiveness in them but nowhere
 
07:44:59.868 --> 07:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
in any of those position statements do
 
07:45:06.350 --> 07:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:11.590 --> 07:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
form and to also what was brought up um
 
07:45:15.430 --> 07:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
we also are seeing a phasing out um of
 
07:45:17.708 --> 07:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
declawing in the veterinary profession I
 
07:45:20.150 --> 07:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
am a current practicing uh veterinarian
 
07:45:23.030 --> 07:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
here in in the conquered area um I've
 
07:45:25.308 --> 07:45:25.318 align:start position:0%
been practicing since
 
07:45:27.788 --> 07:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
2006 and it is true that when I first
 
07:45:29.350 --> 07:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
graduated and first practiced in the
 
07:45:31.590 --> 07:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
early 2000s you know we did you know a
 
07:45:34.110 --> 07:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of of declaw but in my
 
07:45:37.948 --> 07:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
16 years um we have seen quite a drop
 
07:45:39.388 --> 07:45:39.398 align:start position:0%
off in the number of declaws that we
 
07:45:43.788 --> 07:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
have done um to that end um like I said
 
07:45:45.750 --> 07:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing since
 
07:45:48.670 --> 07:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
2006 I think the last time I
 
07:45:50.830 --> 07:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
did a declaw procedure was about seven
 
07:45:53.150 --> 07:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
to eight years ago or even more I kind
 
07:45:58.708 --> 07:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
of just lost track um we do promote
 
07:46:01.670 --> 07:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
the education client education with our
 
07:46:04.030 --> 07:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
clients um we make sure that they
 
07:46:05.468 --> 07:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
understand what the procedure actually
 
07:46:07.430 --> 07:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
involves and we do go into detail of
 
07:46:09.750 --> 07:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
about exactly what we're doing so nobody
 
07:46:12.388 --> 07:46:12.398 align:start position:0%
is under the misguidance of not knowing
 
07:46:15.230 --> 07:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
what the true declaw procedure is um you
 
07:46:16.910 --> 07:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
know we don't we don't try to kind of
 
07:46:19.230 --> 07:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
pull the wow of anybody's
 
07:46:21.270 --> 07:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
eyes and because I haven't done this
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
procedure in about 7 to 10 years I have
 
07:46:28.270 --> 07:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
a pat on my own back um 100% rate of
 
07:46:31.468 --> 07:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
convincing owners not to do declaw um
 
07:46:33.548 --> 07:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
but if the situation should arise that I
 
07:46:35.708 --> 07:46:35.718 align:start position:0%
need to do a declaw procedure I don't
 
07:46:38.468 --> 07:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
want the threat of a criminal penalty
 
07:46:41.468 --> 07:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
behind my back um and if I could tell a
 
07:46:43.868 --> 07:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
small story this morning I did
 
07:46:46.070 --> 07:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
surgery representative erens you said
 
07:46:49.030 --> 07:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
about a tumor on a toe my initial plan
 
07:46:50.590 --> 07:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
going in doing the surgery this morning
 
07:46:52.750 --> 07:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
was to remove the tumor and the tumor
 
07:46:56.308 --> 07:46:56.318 align:start position:0%
only however plans changed I needed to
 
07:47:00.910 --> 07:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
amputate a claw if this claw ended up
 
07:47:03.150 --> 07:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
becoming something that was involving
 
07:47:04.788 --> 07:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
more than just the other toe if I
 
07:47:07.070 --> 07:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
thought that it was also potentially
 
07:47:09.948 --> 07:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
involving other toes on the claw or on
 
07:47:09.958 --> 07:47:11.350 align:start position:0%
involving other toes on the claw or on
the

07:47:11.350 --> 07:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:47:14.150 --> 07:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
foot if this was a criminal penalty I
 
07:47:16.270 --> 07:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
would have to think long and hard about
 
07:47:18.150 --> 07:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
removing other toes um in the the middle
 
07:47:20.510 --> 07:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
of my procedure um would I have even
 
07:47:23.190 --> 07:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
taken that claw off at that point um I
 
07:47:25.150 --> 07:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
made a game d decision to remove the
 
07:47:29.308 --> 07:47:29.318 align:start position:0%
entire claw but I don't want the idea of
 
07:47:32.948 --> 07:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
a medical procedure a very ubiquitous
 
07:47:35.510 --> 07:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
nebulous term medical reason hanging
 
07:47:36.990 --> 07:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
over me making my decisions in the
 
07:47:38.350 --> 07:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
middle of surgery while I have a patient
 
07:47:38.360 --> 07:47:39.230 align:start position:0%
middle of surgery while I have a patient
under

07:47:39.230 --> 07:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
under
 
07:47:41.990 --> 07:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesia I also don't want the threat
 
07:47:44.190 --> 07:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
of a criminal penalty when I'm making
 
07:47:47.270 --> 07:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
these decisions with another client if
 
07:47:48.830 --> 07:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're coming to me they're asking my
 
07:47:52.150 --> 07:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
opinion on things and in this bill with
 
07:47:55.350 --> 07:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption medical reason
 
07:47:58.590 --> 07:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
there's no definition in this bill so
 
07:48:00.990 --> 07:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
there is no way for me to know at the
 
07:48:04.468 --> 07:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
time if I'm making a true medical
 
07:48:08.830 --> 07:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:11.030 --> 07:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
cat I want to make sure I get all of
 
07:48:13.910 --> 07:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
your an questions answered
 
07:48:20.308 --> 07:48:20.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:22.388 --> 07:48:22.398 align:start position:0%
survey was brought up by one of our
 
07:48:24.230 --> 07:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
other other veterinarians here and we
 
07:48:26.388 --> 07:48:26.398 align:start position:0%
did do a survey as the New Hampshire VMA
 
07:48:28.910 --> 07:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
we wanted to know what the answers were
 
07:48:32.468 --> 07:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we do not have the um
 
07:48:34.590 --> 07:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
Financial capabilities of doing any sort
 
07:48:36.388 --> 07:48:36.398 align:start position:0%
of data processing so I can only speak
 
07:48:39.510 --> 07:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
to what the survey said to us and our
 
07:48:42.948 --> 07:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
survey did um kind of resoundingly say
 
07:48:44.788 --> 07:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
that veterinarians
 
07:48:49.030 --> 07:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
are opposed and do not promote decline
 
07:48:51.230 --> 07:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
um but they do not appreciate being
 
07:48:53.868 --> 07:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
legislated about it um I can get you
 
07:48:56.030 --> 07:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
that information you know so you choose
 
07:48:58.150 --> 07:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
um but it is in a very lengthy document
 
07:48:59.430 --> 07:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
because like I said we don't have data
 
07:49:00.948 --> 07:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
processing so I don't have actual
 
07:49:06.430 --> 07:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:09.868 --> 07:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
um I can also speak on the number of
 
07:49:12.308 --> 07:49:12.318 align:start position:0%
cats being declawed here in the state
 
07:49:13.948 --> 07:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
nor the number of cats that are already
 
07:49:17.388 --> 07:49:17.398 align:start position:0%
declawed U but I can say 25% in my
 
07:49:20.070 --> 07:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
practice ice is a gross exaggeration
 
07:49:21.430 --> 07:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
that would mean one out of every four
 
07:49:24.590 --> 07:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
cats coming into my practice was declaw
 
07:49:26.110 --> 07:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
and I can honestly tell you I don't
 
07:49:27.868 --> 07:49:27.878 align:start position:0%
remember the last time I saw a declaw
 
07:49:30.548 --> 07:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
cat coming into my office um it actually
 
07:49:32.468 --> 07:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
takes me by surprise sometimes when I do
 
07:49:35.110 --> 07:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
go to clip the nails on a front foot and
 
07:49:38.030 --> 07:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are no claws to be clipped so um
 
07:49:39.788 --> 07:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
it's not something that here in New
 
07:49:42.708 --> 07:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are seeing a lot of um but
 
07:49:44.468 --> 07:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
again we don't have any data uh so I
 
07:49:46.190 --> 07:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
can't give you hard and true facts but I
 
07:49:47.868 --> 07:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
can tell you that in my practice ractice
 
07:49:50.150 --> 07:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
here in conquered um one of the busiest
 
07:49:52.830 --> 07:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
practices here in conquered um we do not
 
07:49:56.190 --> 07:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
see that level of decla cats and like I
 
07:49:59.190 --> 07:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
said we also have not P per performed
 
07:50:04.070 --> 07:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
the procedure in almost a decade um and
 
07:50:07.270 --> 07:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
I did want to clarify um with some of
 
07:50:09.270 --> 07:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that have been brought
 
07:50:13.670 --> 07:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
up about how these are painful
 
07:50:15.788 --> 07:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
procedures I want to make sure everybody
 
07:50:17.788 --> 07:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
realizes that we're not doing this
 
07:50:20.430 --> 07:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
procedure on an awake animal the cat is
 
07:50:20.440 --> 07:50:21.388 align:start position:0%
procedure on an awake animal the cat is
not

07:50:21.388 --> 07:50:21.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:50:23.750 --> 07:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
awake we use general
 
07:50:26.110 --> 07:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
anesthesia we use a plethora of
 
07:50:29.388 --> 07:50:29.398 align:start position:0%
different pre-anesthetic medications we
 
07:50:31.548 --> 07:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
use medications during the
 
07:50:35.030 --> 07:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
procedure and we use medications
 
07:50:37.350 --> 07:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards and I think anybody can agree
 
07:50:38.910 --> 07:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
with me that has had a surgical
 
07:50:42.910 --> 07:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
procedure that surgery is not pain free
 
07:50:45.670 --> 07:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
our goal in surgery is to make
 
07:50:49.948 --> 07:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
it as less of a pain as possible and we
 
07:50:52.548 --> 07:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
do that right now with all of our surg
 
07:50:55.308 --> 07:50:55.318 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures
 
07:50:58.590 --> 07:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
um and we make it a point of Pride that
 
07:51:00.590 --> 07:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
we are keeping up with all of the
 
07:51:02.708 --> 07:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
different medications that are arising
 
07:51:05.948 --> 07:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
for our cat patients um so I just wanted
 
07:51:07.628 --> 07:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
to make that abundantly clear that this
 
07:51:12.708 --> 07:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:14.990 --> 07:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
um me make sure that I'm answering all
 
07:51:16.670 --> 07:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the questions that kind of came up as
 
07:51:16.680 --> 07:51:22.030 align:start position:0%
of the questions that kind of came up as
well

07:51:22.030 --> 07:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:25.830 --> 07:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's all that I had um so
 
07:51:27.430 --> 07:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
we also want to just bring out you know
 
07:51:29.190 --> 07:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
the the point of we are willing to work
 
07:51:31.430 --> 07:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
with any organization um as the
 
07:51:34.110 --> 07:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
veterinary medical profession um that
 
07:51:36.190 --> 07:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
works with bills that are directly uh
 
07:51:40.270 --> 07:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
affecting us um so we we're open to um
 
07:51:42.070 --> 07:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
helping craft legislation that that
 
07:51:44.670 --> 07:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
revolves us
 
07:51:47.308 --> 07:51:47.318 align:start position:0%
directly thank you all right will you
 
07:51:49.110 --> 07:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
take some questions of course
 
07:51:51.628 --> 07:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron thank you Mr chair
 
07:51:53.430 --> 07:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for your testimony
 
07:51:55.548 --> 07:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and thank you for taking
 
07:51:58.270 --> 07:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
my question I'm interested to know for
 
07:52:00.670 --> 07:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
the cats in your practice
 
07:52:04.030 --> 07:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
07:52:08.350 --> 07:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
declawed can you speak to their General
 
07:52:11.948 --> 07:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
Health are they having problems because
 
07:52:13.670 --> 07:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
of it are they brought to you because
 
07:52:13.680 --> 07:52:14.708 align:start position:0%
of it are they brought to you because
there's

07:52:14.708 --> 07:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
there's
 
07:52:17.910 --> 07:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
problems uh stemming from their declaw
 
07:52:21.190 --> 07:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
or just other
 
07:52:24.388 --> 07:52:24.398 align:start position:0%
issues there was a recent research paper
 
07:52:27.350 --> 07:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
out that studied specifically arthritis
 
07:52:30.868 --> 07:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
and cats and by a certain age I believe
 
07:52:34.868 --> 07:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
it was five years old 65% of all cats
 
07:52:37.670 --> 07:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
five years and older have arthritis
 
07:52:37.680 --> 07:52:38.830 align:start position:0%
five years and older have arthritis
whether

07:52:38.830 --> 07:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
07:52:42.830 --> 07:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
we whether we see it or
 
07:52:47.510 --> 07:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
not and so I can't speak directly to the
 
07:52:50.388 --> 07:52:50.398 align:start position:0%
declaw cats because again there's not
 
07:52:54.150 --> 07:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
many decla cats in my practice um but I
 
07:52:57.270 --> 07:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
would say that arthritis is a big issue
 
07:53:01.308 --> 07:53:01.318 align:start position:0%
in cats and I'm not quite sure how to
 
07:53:04.350 --> 07:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
link up arthritis that are directly
 
07:53:07.150 --> 07:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
related to a declawed cat versus an UND
 
07:53:10.948 --> 07:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
declawed cat because the abundance of
 
07:53:15.070 --> 07:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
cats that have arthritis as a general
 
07:53:18.070 --> 07:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
statement okay thank you
 
07:53:21.628 --> 07:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:23.830 --> 07:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
07:53:25.910 --> 07:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming in I appreciate your testimony
 
07:53:27.628 --> 07:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's the last card
 
07:53:29.110 --> 07:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
that I have is there anyone else that
 
07:53:31.708 --> 07:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on this
 
07:53:34.070 --> 07:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I'm going to read the
 
07:53:36.030 --> 07:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
results from the blue sheet we have uh
 
07:53:39.350 --> 07:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
four people signed in three in favor one
 
07:53:44.230 --> 07:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
against online we had 93 Pro 23 con and
 
07:53:44.240 --> 07:53:45.150 align:start position:0%
against online we had 93 Pro 23 con and
one

07:53:45.150 --> 07:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:53:47.628 --> 07:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
neutral and with that I am going to to
 
07:53:51.030 --> 07:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB
 
07:53:55.750 --> 07:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
1226 question Mr Question um is this an
 
07:53:55.760 --> 07:53:57.070 align:start position:0%
1226 question Mr Question um is this an
early

07:53:57.070 --> 07:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
early
 
07:54:01.830 --> 07:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill this I believe yes it is an early
 
07:54:04.868 --> 07:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
bill so for the committee we were
 
07:54:06.468 --> 07:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
intending to exec more bills but
 
07:54:08.110 --> 07:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
obviously it's getting pretty late in
 
07:54:11.070 --> 07:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
the day so doing that uh today I don't
 
07:54:12.590 --> 07:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
think is going to be fair to the
 
07:54:15.230 --> 07:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to schedule a full
 
07:54:19.388 --> 07:54:19.398 align:start position:0%
committee work session next Tuesday and
 
07:54:23.150 --> 07:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be working on House Bill
 
07:54:27.830 --> 07:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
1454 and we'll be doing a exec session
 
07:54:30.190 --> 07:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
after that I I may
 
07:54:32.830 --> 07:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
add I may add another bill or two to
 
07:54:34.270 --> 07:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
that but we will have a full committee
 
07:54:36.110 --> 07:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
work session so plan on that and then
 
07:54:38.468 --> 07:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
we'll have an exec session as well but
 
07:54:40.708 --> 07:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
we we'll definitely be working on 1454
 
07:54:43.910 --> 07:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll U I'll work with rep Bixby and
 
07:54:45.190 --> 07:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
see if there's others maybe that we need
 
07:54:46.590 --> 07:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
to add to that I have until noon
 
07:54:50.350 --> 07:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to commit to a calendar so
 
07:54:51.910 --> 07:54:51.920 align:start position:0%

today yeah both both bills we exact are
 
07:55:09.430 --> 07:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
