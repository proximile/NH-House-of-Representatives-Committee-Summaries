well thank you very much I don't often
 
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 align:start position:0%
get here so but uh this
 
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
being a pressing need uh my name is
 
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 align:start position:0%
James Gray I represent Senate District 6
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
which starts up in Alton gilmon comes
 
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
down Route 11 to
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester um State Prison uh uh needs to
 
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.110 align:start position:0%
Rochester um State Prison uh uh needs to
be

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
replaced if you look back at our history
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
of state prisons and uh uh the Court
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
decisions that have told us that uh that
 
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
we have to take action um and you've
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
seen the pictures I'm sure that they've
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
been distributed to you um this is
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
something that has to happen uh right
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
now there is room in the state budget uh
 
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
that this $40 million uh can be bought
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
fed uh that the treasurer has confirmed
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
that to me uh in emails and it is
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
something that is due it's something
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
that is needed uh and if we are really
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know interested in the recidivism
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
rate uh we need to make the
 
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.390 align:start position:0%
rate uh we need to make the
facilities

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh such that uh that we can uh help that
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
along so I'll be willing to ask answer
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
any questions but but uh I'm sure that
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections is here to
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
testify and they probably can answer
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
much better than I thank you Senator
 
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
foli this is just for the design right
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
this is just for the design and
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary work
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further questions for the
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
are very expensive uh
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
represent Mills yes sir yes sir Senator
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea what the total cost
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
of building is going to be what we're
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
looking forward to after this initial
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
I've heard some estimates but I would
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
rather get get that information right
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Corrections thank
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%

Greg seeing none thank you for your time
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
sir I'll go back to election law then
 
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
now um I would like to um call John
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
highways thank you Mr chairman for the
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
record I am John Graham I live in
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
Bedford and for 20 sub years I was on
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
this committee so I understand um how
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
this works I would like to remind
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
everybody what I said when House Bill 25
 
00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
was being heard a little over a year ago
 
00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.590 align:start position:0%
was being heard a little over a year ago
that

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
the governor had proposed this $40
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
million for this engineering design and
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
look in house uh House Bill too the
 
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
legislature I.E the finance committee
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
saw fit to take that $40 million out so
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
that brings us back here trying to
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
borrow the $40 million to do that and
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
we've lost a year on this I'd also like
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
to ask how many of you around this table
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
have been in the The Men's prison
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
to take a
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
tour I am sure that the rest of you if
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
you ask the commissioner while he's here
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
talking that he can arrange a tour so
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
you can see what the problem is we've
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
been kicking this can for at least two
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
decades and for those who've been on
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
this committee for a while you realize
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
that the only reason we have a new
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
women's prison is that we lost a court
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
case and we had to build it to the
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
specific ations of the court and not to
 
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
any kind of study or design so you have
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
a hard decision to make on whether or
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
not to do this 40 million bonding
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
outside of the capital
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
budget understanding that in probably
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
27 um H House Bill 25 you're going to
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
have to deal with actually taking the
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
study and deciding what to do with
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
um the study and where you're going to
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
build it how large and all the rest I'm
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
sure that there will be people who go we
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
don't need to build a new prison or or
 
00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.270 align:start position:0%
don't need to build a new prison or or
whatever

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
but my personal opinion is having looked
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
at this and put uh Band-Aids on the
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
whole problem for two decades that we
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
need to start doing something um how
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to fund it I will leave to
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the general court which I'm no longer
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
part of thank
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
God for some of this
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
but um that's all I wanted to say Mr
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I think I went over by two
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
minutes I said that I'd do but it's good
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
always good to be here thank you um
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and um
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
Chairman's privileged to run long so uh
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please repres thank you
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.270 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please repres thank you
chairman

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
good morning could you briefly describe
 
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.389 align:start position:0%
good morning could you briefly describe
the

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
conditions and and briefly what we've
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
been through the past 20 years we've
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
we've fixed roofs we've tried to fix
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
some of the plumbing uh we fixed the
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
Locking mechanisms on doors so that that
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
the doors would lock um right now um
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
couple of iterations ago we did work on
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
the sewer system because things get
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
flushed down the the the system that
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't be going doubt it um
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
but you'll see some pictures hopefully
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
from the Department on rain and other
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
water coming down into the kitchen area
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh there are deteriorating there's mold
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
there's a spe we can go on and on but
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to leave that to the department
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure that they have um
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
pictures because they always bring
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
pictures of of the problem um um and
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is a start on the solution as as
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
far as I can see um it will determine
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
where how large what's it's going to
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
cost and I know that uh representative
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
fidal asked it 4 million for um just
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
design and Engineering that's about
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
typical of a 10% cost for a major
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
project you put that much into it so
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking at whether
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's 300
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
400 or less or more who knows until it's
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
done represent Melvin thank
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
you could you tell me when the uh prism
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
was built no I I'll leave all those
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
kinds of questions to the department it
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
was in the 1800s part of it 1800s yes
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
and um any further
 
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.509 align:start position:0%
and um any further
questions

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and actually the 1800s part is the
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
better better facility than what we've
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
added on yeah all right thank you thank
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony you're always
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
welcome back here you really mean that
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman well it has been a few
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
months we were starting to miss you so
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman the uh
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
for the some of the newer board members
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
the suggestion is actually what we need
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
to do uh once you've been there you will
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
never forget it and um the uh one of the
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
terms when we were talking about through
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
the C capital budget and the
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
conversation came up to how bad a roof
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
was was how many buckets were containing
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
the water that came that came from this
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
facility so with
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I would like to
 
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.150 align:start position:0%
that I would like to
recognize

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%

Raymond New Hampshire Department of
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill uh 476 so Mr chairman

me the opportunity to speak with you
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
this morning in support of this
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
legislation my name is Paul Raymond Jr
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant commissioner for the
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh being handed around today
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
is a copy of my testimony as well as uh
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
some slides that have been printed off
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
to give you a small glimpse into what
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with at the New Hampshire
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
state prison for men
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
currently uh the department extends our
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
thanks to Senator gray and all the
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on this crucial piece of
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
legislation it goes without saying but
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state prison for men
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
is an aged inefficient facility with
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
very poor conditions for both our staff
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
and those who work there it's also
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that our staff
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
are gen Al working 16 hour shifts a day
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
due to our our significantly High
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now uh staff members
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
generally come in for an 8 hour shift
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
and are often forced into a 16h hour
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
shift due to our minimum standards to
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can maintain Safety
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
and Security at the
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
facilities as was mentioned earlier the
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
current prison campus style Correctional
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
Facility was originally built in
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
1878 we are in fact still using parts of
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
that original structure
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
for housing uh and programming and the
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
last time that the structure received
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
significant Renovations was in the 1980s
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
when we added uh several additional
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
structures for far too long the
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
operational and structural needs of the
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state prison for men have
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
been unmet and the demands of running a
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
large 247 Correctional Facility focused
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
on Rehabilitation are catching up with
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
the architectural failures like much of
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
Corrections in general is on the brink
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
of failure this $40 million
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation is needed to identify the
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
next steps in the replacement of the New
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men I won't
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
read my entire testimony for you but I
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
do want to highlight some of the key
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
points that that I've identified for you
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
first is our Recruitment and Retention
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
concerns so while the conditions are
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
poor and and challenging in general for
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
our residents who live there it's
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
simultaneously just as difficult for the
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
people who have to work there and like I
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier with our with our
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
Correctional uh entry-level Corrections
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
Officers vacancy rate hovering around
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
50% it's not uncommon for us to force
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
our staff into working 16 hour shifts so
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
16 hours nearly five days a week in
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
harsh conditions is really difficult to
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
retain people people generally come to
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
work for us but unfortunately due to the
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
condition they're often looking for
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
other opportunities of employment we're
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
not going to hire our way out of the
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate we have to retain the good
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
people that we have working hard in our
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities every single day making
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
changes to our Correctional environment
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
is going to help us retain
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
staff it's important to recognize that
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
the the structural issues and the lack
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
of ventilation throughout the facility
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
make it nearly unbearable during the
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
summer months for our staff especially
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
in fact we close down housing units
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
because of how unbearable it gets due to
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
ventilation the other thing to keep in
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
mind is that the depart US Department of
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
Labor has already identified that uh in
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years they expect a greater
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
than 7% decrease in the workforce for
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers we're already at a
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
significant significant vacancy rate and
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
we know through projections that that's
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
probably going to get
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
worse when we talk about Rehabilitation
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of our primary
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities at the Department of
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
Corrections we know statistically that
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
greater than 95% of people incarcerated
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
today are going to be
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
released it's our responsibility to
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate them or at least give them
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate it's very difficult to do
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
that in a facility that was built with
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
punishment in mind not
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation right this is an old
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
facility built in the 1800s designed
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
around the Pennsylvania style of
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
penitentiary right sit by yourself and
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
be remorseful we know that that doesn't
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
work we know that we need to provide
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
effective programming to all of these
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
residents in order for them to become
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
better members of society it's our
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide uh education
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
vocational training mental health
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
treatment and substance misuse
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
programming so that when the residents
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
are ready to be released they have
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
successfully met our Rehabilitation
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative needs a construction uh
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
sorry a prison constructed in 1878 and
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
even with the designs and the
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
enhancements made in
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
1980 are not uh meeting the advancements
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
and best practices necessary for
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
Effective rehabilitation
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
economically if we just look at the
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
prison we're looking at spending
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
approximately $150 million in
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
band-aiding the prison over the next
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
five years in the testimony that I've
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
provided I've outlined exactly what
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
those are going to look like we're
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
looking at repairs to significant
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
concrete needs throughout the building
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
replacement of electrical Transformers
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
replacement of the perimeter fence as
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
well as roads and parking lots and that
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't even get into the roofs
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
and the actual structure of the
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
buildings that are going to need to be
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
worked on we also recognize that five
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
years beyond that we're estimating to
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
million so these repairs over the next
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
10 years are well over half of the cost
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
of a new facility which at this time
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
Services cost estimates we received just
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
this past week we estimate the cost of a
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
new prison facility is going to be
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
approximately $584
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
million given the current rate of
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
inflation this cost is expected to
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
increase exponentially over the next
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
several years the time is now to take
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
action and to start making an
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
improvement to our prison
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
facility the department appreciates the
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
$10 million that we received in the
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
budget and that allows us for a a full
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
sight evaluation of the proect
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
prospective site which is going to be
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
located behind
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
the current New Hampshire correctional
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
facility for women in
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
conquered however for the Department to
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
move forward with the architectural and
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
engineering and forecasting for the
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
replacement facility it would cost
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 10% as was previously
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned so we need this additional $40
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
million to get toward that architectural
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
and engineering design
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
phase uh you've likely heard about the
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
issues we're having in the kitchen uh we
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
continue to significant issues in the
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen at the Men's prison and in fact
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are pictures in the attachments
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
for you where you can see it does
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
require us to have a lot of tarps as
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
well as hosing to make sure that the
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
water doesn't drip onto the food
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
preparation areas we've worked hand
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
inand with our partners at the
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
Division of Public Health services to
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have a safe and clean
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
environment but at the end of the day we
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
really need to replace the prison the
 
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0%
really need to replace the prison the
prison

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
kitchen replacement of the kitchen today
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
in the current environment would cost
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
over $1 million and it doesn't sound
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible to spend $ million
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
when in turn we really need a new prison
 
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
when in turn we really need a new prison
in

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
general we also have the reception and
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
diagnostic unit that I want to call
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
attention to you've got pictures of what
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
we commonly call R&amp;D and this is
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
generally where people who are newly
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
incarcerated will come into the prison
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
facility the facility is is uh that's
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
part of the original 1878 facility that
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
we have at the prison that we're still
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
using we continue to have water leaks
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
and in fact we've brought in numerous um
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
plumbers and and Engineers to assist us
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
and given the old infrastructure and
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
architecture of that building none of
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
them are willing to actually do the
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
necessary work to completely fix it all
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing is literally putting
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids on the
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
problem and then when we talk about
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
technology we're driving to try to make
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh our our department more efficient for
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
our employees we're trying to find ways
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we can Implement technology that's
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to drive efficiencies and make it
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
easier for people to work with us uh
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're not able to do that in the age of
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure that we currently have
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
as well as the large campus footprint so
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do uh Implement
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
technologies that will allow us to make
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
it easier for people to do their jobs
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
but also we're trying to only Implement
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
technology IES that we know today that
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
we could pick up and move to a
 
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.990 align:start position:0%
we could pick up and move to a
replacement

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
facility so in closing I just want to
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the dangers are real the
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is asking this
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee to further back us in our
 
00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
mission to provide secure Humane
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
supervision and evidence-based
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and to support the
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
replacement of the New Hampshire state
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
prison for men my testimony today is
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
only a brief snapshot of the many
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
reasons why a replacement Correctional
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
Facility is needed
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
once again on behalf of the Department
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
of Corrections I thank the sponsors of s
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
SP 476 for helping us to take this large
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
step forward for our goal of replacing
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
the facility thank you again for this
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I'm happy to take any
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have you have
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
many thank you commissioner uh repr Jack
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner um if I understood what you
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
said correctly there's agreement on a on
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
a site for the new prison that is is
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
determined to be
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
suitable yes we we have uh we have
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of property behind the existing
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
prisons the the men's Correctional
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
Facility and the women's correctional
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
facility that is more than sufficient
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
Facility represent V
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
please Mr chair I probably got a couple
 
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
please Mr chair I probably got a couple
but

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
um I got Quant fully support your
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
concept um but a lot of concerns
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
like if you do this are you looking
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
design a facility that can operate with
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
peer employees we are saving money by
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
having double
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
overtime um and I don't think you're
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get the budget to
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
accommodate what you actually need for
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
straight 8 hour shfs we can't afford it
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
building in an Optimum
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
location or are we
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
building because we have
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
the property that is not
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
Optimum and are we planning longterm
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
because the structural failures that I'm
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
seeing here my first visit to the state
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
prison was 1975 when there was an open
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
sewer going through the
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
cafeteria uh and I've been through
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
multiple uh changes since the largest
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
vote I took was to expand the prison in
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
1980 that we were promised would carry
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
us through 19 uh
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
2050 and then we had to build burlin so
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's failed
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
so what how comfortable you folks in
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
your long-term planning are we building
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
like we did with the women's prison a
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
postage stamp because we had the
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
property or are we building where we can
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
maximize what the property is or should
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
we be looking
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I appreciate that question I I
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
think we are building in the ideal
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
location for a number of reasons first
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
we have the the majority of our staff
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
are currently working conquered to to
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
move out of uh the current environment I
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
think would be a challenge to some of
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
our staff members um I I would say that
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
we are forecasting for what is necessary
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
but in this 40 million it will allow us
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
to do not only a population assessment
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
but also a staffing assessment so beyond
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
the engineering and design we need to do
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
that Staffing assessment to determine
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
what's necessary for this facility as
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know we can operate because of
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
efficiencies built in into the northern
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire correctional facility and
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
the correctional facility for women we
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
can operate with fewer staff right we
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
have a very old facility right now and
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll just call attention to the
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
reception and Diagnostics unit right so
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
on uh page eight of my testimony there's
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
a picture of the lever system that's
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
required to operate the cells uh the
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
cell doors in that prison so when you
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
think about a newer environment they're
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
all remotely controlled from a control
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
room so a person who's trained
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
sits there waits for the call from a
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
corrections officer and opens the door
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
in this situation we have to add
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
additional people to not only open the
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
door but then be at the door and then do
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
the escort and then with the current R&amp;D
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
facility it's multi-tiered and there has
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
to be a person at each door at each
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
level at each level so when you think
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
about escorting a person around the
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
Reception Diagnostics unit takes almost
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
twice as many people as is necessary to
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
escort somebody around the Northern New
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Correctional Facility so we
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
are factoring that into into our goal in
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
this replacement facility we have to
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
factor in the the staffing needs and the
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
Staffing benefits that I think we're
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
going to see from this new facility and
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
then follow up yeah okay yes go ahead
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
please represent Follow by represent F
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
all part of your testimony was these
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
folks have to come out the door um and
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
that changed with Mr Bennett in 1920 to
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
change to Corrections instead of
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh punishment um you folks used to have
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
a great automotive shop and a great body
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
shop which guaranteed the day they
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
walked out the door they could have a
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
job that no longer exists uh is that
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of Staffing a lack of
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
instructors or a lack of secure that
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
seemed to be one of the best things you
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
had going and it's gone yeah so it
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
actually it is in operation um it's it's
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's in operation in fact I I uh uh
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
last March I had my are there for an
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
inspection so they did the inspection
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
and the work to get my car back on the
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
road um so we do have the the system uh
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
in the programming do you still have the
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
body shop we do have uh the body shop is
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
not there right yeah um real part of it
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
is our is Staffing so finding the people
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
to provide the instruction uh and the
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
education that goes with that facility
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
but we also are recognizing the other
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are available too so
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
we've expanded our our print shop
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we've added technology there we've
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
expanded our uh our woodw woodworking
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
program um so we have uh I I think the
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
the programming opportunities EVs and
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
flows with the needs of the not only the
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
residents but also the needs of uh
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
assessing the community and so uh
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes there isn't uh we can't keep a
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
program operational but we do still have
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
the mechanic shop um and and we're
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
always looking at ways to improve the
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
ational programming that we bring to the
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
residents thank you okay thank you
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
represent representative fidal
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
please than
 
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
me you repr I'm we're having a hard time
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
am how many prisoners is the new
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
facility going to be designed to
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
house number one
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
one number
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
though the real problem at at existing
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
is that there has not been a very good
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance plan in effect for a lot of
 
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.310 align:start position:0%
maintenance plan in effect for a lot of
years

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
and whether that's going to happen in
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
the new prison or not is is critical to
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
any building you build to have a
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
maintenance plan so you don't get leaky
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
roofs you don't get this I
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
mean it just seems like an enormous
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
investment uh is there a question in
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
there represent fidelie well thank you I
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
asked one question the other question
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
is has it ever been considered to
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
shipping the prisoners out of
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
state those was my two questions okay um
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry remind me of the the first
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
question oh how housing how many how
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
many residents to house so um we we are
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
looking at a replacement prison so we we
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
currently have uh housing for
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,200 in the New Hampshire
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
state prison for Med um we uh we are at
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
a 30-year low when it comes to
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
population in the prison system in New
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um you know some of that
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
the final number number will be
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
determined as part of the population
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
assessment that's done in this phase uh
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
but there's no commitment that's been
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
made to a firm number for the the
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
replacement prison but it is a
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
replacement prison we're not looking to
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
um grow or downsize we're looking to
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
replace the existing prison that we
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
currently have your other question about
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh sending out of state um we do
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
participate in the uh interstate compact
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh however the interstate compact does
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
requ require for everyone that we send
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
out of state we get one in return so we
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
do participate in the interstate compact
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you represent fidal any
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
other further questions from the
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
Boger we have uh built I should say you
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
have had built two new prisons one I
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
guess is the Men's prison in the North
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
country and the other's the women have
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh the best practices of those prisons
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
and optimize them so that uh we can have
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
a better Men's prison here in conquer
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's question one and question two the
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
location behind the current
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
prison uh is the site work itself I
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
understand there might be a lot of
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
granite back there and would that add to
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.549 align:start position:0%
the cost
ex

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
ex
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
over than purchasing land somewhere else
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
that has less Granite to build
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
on I appreciate that question so um the
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes we are taking in all of the best
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
practices but I I'll tell you the um the
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
women's facility is is really the one
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
that has most of the best practices
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
current best practices for Correctional
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
design uh in place um the Northern New
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Correctional Facility
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
up in Berlin it does have a lot of best
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
practices still uh and we will work to
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
optimize those into any design of a new
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility that's for sure um
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
we see those the the optimization in
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
both of our newer facilities although
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
granted the northern Correctional
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
Facility is almost 25 years old so it's
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
not as new for a correctional facility
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
um but it is on the newer side the
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
women's facility is absolutely new and
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
and we see uh for lack of a better term
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
we reap the benefits of that new
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility with our women residents um it
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
is focused on Rehabilitation it is
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
reintegration and uh and we see that
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
benefit which is why uh our women's
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
reism rate is better than the rest of
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
the country so we see that uh just in
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
the new facility that we have and the
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
capabilities were able to perform in
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
that environment um I will say uh for
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
the for the facility I'm I or for the
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
footprint uh behind the current women's
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
prison I'm not an engineer uh but the
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
engineers that I've spoken with have all
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
told me that that it is an ideal
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
facility for uh for what we want to do
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
back there so I have to I take their
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
word that uh that it is a a good space
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions of Mr
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
Raymond yes represent Newman
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
please yes ju just following up on that
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
so the Engineers have said it's an ideal
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
site it's workable but have they said if
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's granite or anything else under
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
that would require a lot of
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinary efforts I I haven't been
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh part of any of those discussions I'm
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
happy to go back and ask the engineers
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh specifically and we can try and get
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
an answer to the committee okay thank
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
you uh okay representative jurors
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
followed by represent Connor please
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner um I guess the and
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
continue the thread on the um this the
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
site work have you have you or the
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
anybody in the department scoped out a
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
an alternative property for for for you
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
know just to compare what it would take
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
and number two um uh we're still going
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
to be spending money on maintenance and
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh just from your your presentation here
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're still going to be spending
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
probably tens of hundreds of thousands
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars on until the point we open
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
the gates to a new facility correct
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you okay thank you as
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
far as uh for your for your first
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know if we scoped out
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
any other facilities um but I'm happy to
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
talk with the engineers and get an
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
answer back to the committee oh you have
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
a follow up you have please continue
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
repr jur and a comment land being at a
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
premium these days yeah we we own that
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
property that's currently available
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
behind us which is one of the reason
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
reasons you know and then the other part
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
to be quite candid is um there aren't uh
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't think there's a community in
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that wants us to build a
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
new prison in their
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
Community thank you thank you Mr oh
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome rest of Connor
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um now you
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
said um the women's prison um you said
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's focused on
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation how many um I don't know
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
if you have the numbers but how many
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
have reoffended after
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
leaving the prison um our our recidivism
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
rate is better uh from the women's
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
prison than the national average I don't
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
know offhand what the specific number
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
was or what the number is but I do know
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
that it is better than the national
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
average for
 
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.030 align:start position:0%
average for
recidivism

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
recidivism
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct thank welcome further question
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
representive Edgar
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
please uh thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
for answering my question um I'm looking
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
at uh slide number
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
four and it it says you have about 1900
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
is that total prisoners in this state
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
and could you give a breakdown between
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh what the what the population is for
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
the major prisons you
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
have yes uh so we have uh approximately
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
1900 uh I I think the number this
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
morning we was 1972 incarcerated in the
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that includes all
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
of uh our numbers so we have a uh a one
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
through five classification system so
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
one being individuals who are in a
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
transitional housing unit so the last
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
step of re-entry into the community uh
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
we have a couple hundred there and then
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh up to C5 which C5 is our maximum
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
security uh offenders and uh so
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in conquered we have
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
approximately a th000 incarcerated in
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Berlin facility we have
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 and then there's
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 100 at the women's
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
facility and then the rest are in that
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
in the transitional housing
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
units okay can you have a followup uh
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes just a clarification how many um i'
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
heard you say before that there were
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
1,200 in the uh the Men's prison is that
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
correct uh capacity for 1,200 uh there's
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
approximately a thousand in there right
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
now thank you you're welcome all right
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions yes please
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin thank you you're
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for taking my question
 
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
do you think that we could use the plans
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
for the uh the woman's prison for the
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
new prison instead of spending $40
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
million for
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
engineers and just redo that plan a
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
little bit to accommodate the males
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
instead of the females so the the
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
women's facility
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
is uh right now is about a tenth of the
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
size of the Men's prison um I I think it
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
would be challenging to take those plans
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
which are now almost 10 years old and
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
try to uh amend them to meet the needs
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
of a much larger uh prison facility so I
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would be challenging to do
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
that okay okay thank you okay the
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions please yes repres I'm
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
Carrie uh Paul do you have any idea of
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
the savings that you might engage in
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
doing this now as opposed to waiting in
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
terms of Energy Efficiency or quite
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm looking at your kitchen and
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
if I were a restaurant tour in downtown
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
congr I don't think I would get a a
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
health pass on that one yeah I um uh I'm
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud of uh the staff that we
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
have in the Men's prison because they
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
have overcome significant challenges in
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh a a a difficult environment to work
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
in um we did have some struggles with
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
some of our health inspections uh
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
however we have passed all of our health
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
inspections recently because of the hard
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
work of our staff to overcome those
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
challenges uh I'm very proud of the work
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
that they've done and the work they
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
continue to do to make sure that we are
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the minimum standards for for
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
health requirements um we've taken
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
extraord ordinary steps to try to
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate all of those concerns uh
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
obviously any congregant setting there
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
is a risk of foodborn illness we're
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
fortunate that we have not had any
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
foodborn illnesses uh in our in the
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
Men's prison in conquered in fact in
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
none of our prison facilities um we're
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking extraordinary steps to reduce the
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
the rodent population that's impacting
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
the entire facility and uh and I'm very
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
proud of the work that they've done
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
because it it has been difficult and
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's been a difficult several months for
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
them to overcome those as far as
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
efficiencies go um we know we are
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of money on water a lot
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
of money on electricity a lot of money
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
on other resources that could definitely
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
be improved upon with a new facility as
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
far as exact numbers I don't have those
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
for you in front of uh in front of me
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
today but I can certainly ask our team
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
to try to uh drive up some estimations
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
on what our cost SA would be moving from
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
our current facility into a newer
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
facility okay a followup represent
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Carrie go ahead so do you have any sense
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the opportunity costs for doing it
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
now as opposed to waiting another couple
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
years sure so we know that just in the
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
last year the cost of uh so since we put
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
this request in the cost of building a
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
new facility the estimation has gone up
 
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.950 align:start position:0%
new facility the estimation has gone up
almost

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
16% so uh nearly 16% inflation on cost
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
of building a new prison since we
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
originally put the 50 million request in
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
I can only imagine that it's going to
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
continue to Rise um as we as we wait or
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
as we try to come up with a solution I
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that our best opportunity is now
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
um if not only for the economic value
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
but also for the Safety and Security
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
value of both our residents and our
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
staff thank you uh yes representative
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
fauler please thank
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
you I almost hesitate to ask a question
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm anticipating the answer but
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
could you explain the state-of-the-art
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
of privately owned and operated prisons
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
and whether that has any possibility of
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
helping our problem
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
here so right now uh there is State
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that prohibits the state of
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from entering into a
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
privately contracted prison uh operation
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
option all right yes for uh okay thank
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
you represent fuler further questions
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
please of assistant commissioner Raymond
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the assistant commissioner okay I
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
think seeing none thank you very much

for coming in and do do making your
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
presentation and answering our questions
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
please assist thank you very much but we
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
will be in touch okay now I just I the
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
my next witness is Devin chasy chafy of
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire doesn't
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
indicate on your pink card the position
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
and I just want to for Miss chaffy and
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee at 10:45 we an
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
Exe on Executive session on two bills so
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
I may have to to stop because some
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
people may want to see these bills exact
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes recess these this
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
hearing and go into an executive session
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
on the our two bills and then we'll come
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
right back so I think you've got two
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
minutes so make your pre and maybe a
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
question or two then I'm going to recess
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
this hearing close to 10:45 absolutely
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative and I I shouldn't be long
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much uh and thank you so
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
much to the committee for the
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify before you today
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
my name is Devon chaffy I'm the
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
executive director of the ACLU uh
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are not taking a
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
position on this bill uh before you
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
today and the reason why I'm here to
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
testify is because this is a shift from
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
our previous position where we had
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
actually opposed um this funding um and
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
so uh I wanted to clarify our position
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
on this funding today as the ACLU we
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
have generally been skeptical of paying
 
00:43:02.589 --> 00:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
out taxpayer dollars towards um
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
incarceration uh and we have also been
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
very concerned with some of the
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
condition issues in the current men's
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
State Prison and getting those addressed
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible as has already
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
been discussed um however we do very
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
much understand uh the very dire
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
situation currently at the men's State
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
Prison and the impact that that has both
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
on the folks that work there as well as
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
the and the folks that reside there um I
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
have been to the state prison uh
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
numerous times as a visitor and um in my
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
own personal personal estimation I think
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who enters that facility it it
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's very clear why you would need to
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
replace that facility and why the issues
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
with the facility cannot be corrected
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
through repairs personally I don't think
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's a close call um and I think that
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
the current conditions do have a severe
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
impact both on the folks that work there
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
as well as on the um on the residents uh
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know I think it was uh Senator gray
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
actually put it uh well when he talked
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
about the need to continue to reduce
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
recidivism um and the impact that having
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
proper facilities can have and
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately reducing recidivism and
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
therefore reducing the C cost of
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerations to the state I would just
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
clearly state that as we move forward H
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
and if this body decides to move forward
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
with the money to replace the Men's
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
prison I would urge continued
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight of three things
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
first first and ensuring that there is
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
adequate health facilities in these um
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the new U Men's prison that is
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
critical um and quite frankly will save
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
the state a lot in the long run as far
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
as any potential lawsuits of having
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
inadequate Health Care Facilities as
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
well as to preserving the health of
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
those who are there uh education
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
facilities uh are are also the second
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
thing that I would um urge the legis uh
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
legis uh legislative body to focus on is
 
00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton highlighted um the
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
various skill building as well as
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities are key to
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
continuing to reduce recidivism and
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
reintegrate individual residents into
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
our communities and finally making sure
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
that whatever space is built in this
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
facility is uh is does not increase the
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
number of beds and in fact keeps Pace
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the continuing decrease and what we
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
have seen in the population um we heard
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
in answer to representative uh fidal
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions that in fact we have uh 200 uh
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
beds that are currently not being
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
utilized or approximately thereof at the
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
state prison and so if uh we are going
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to see this reduction in
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration at our state prisons the
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers should not be paying uh
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
for beds that we are not using um and so
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh with these three factors in mind uh
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
healthc care education and right sizing
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
the facility um I think those are all
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
three things that are critical for you
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
all to keep in mind as you oversee this
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
facility should you decide to approve
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
this moving forward thank you so much
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm looking at the committee
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
clock and it is close to 10:45 so what
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do to make it easier for
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the Comm if you don't mind staying
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably take just 10 to 15 minutes to
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
help guys uh continue please I wasn't
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
aware of some of this information for
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
question oh yeah open for questions to
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
miss chaffy please
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions on Miss okay yes go ahead
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
represent car so why didn't you take a
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
position on this previously and why now
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
so previously we had opposed the funding
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we were concerned about the
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the use of taxpayers money going towards
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
incarceration I think we had some
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that there might be an attempt
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
to expand the facility as there often
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
are um and I think we have sense um
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
especially and quite frankly in
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
listening to the department and the
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department's argument and me me
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
personally thinking through my
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
experience and having visited the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
facility have come to the opinion that
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
repairs are not sufficient and that
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a replacement facility
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
and so where our Focus as an
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
organization should be now is on making
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
sure that this is done correctly okay
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh further questions
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
of Miss chaffy for members of the
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
committee there any further questions
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
see n thank you very much for coming
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%

okay should I don't if there anybody
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
else wants to testify for or against
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and seeing on the only other
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
thing is the blue sheets we probably
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
need to read those if we're going to if
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
nobody else wants to testify and then
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
we'll move right into the executive
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
now I appreciate everybody's Indulgence
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%

Highway um
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
be uh we typically uh were in executive
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
session decide this uh it's atypical to
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
take testimony but in in light of uh of
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
this subject I'm happy to recognize
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
of safety is strongly in support of this
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation the only
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation I I might humbly suggest
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
is that because uh in his Decades of
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
service the rank of Chief was that to
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
which uh Mr hos ascended uh At His
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
Highest I might suggest that uh his his
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
naming on this on this highway be the
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%

tragically taken away from us way too
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
soon former Chief hos served Franklin
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%

community first and foremost his
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
dedication was an inspiration to his
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
fellow police officers and he is sorely
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
missed the designation is a wonderful
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%

00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
please question of the chair do we need
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
an an amendment to to do this or is the
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
wording the sign really up to the
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
department I I I would believe the
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
cleanest as just so there's no I I it
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
would need to be an amendment I would I
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
would welcome an
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment um we've delayed this process
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
could okay thank you yes uh gentleman
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
do yes so so the the question is we have
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
it we have it listed as officer Bradley
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
I believe many of us would be in favor
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
of Chief
 
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.990 align:start position:0%
of Chief
Bradley

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
Bradley
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
um how's the process go forward if that
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
change was are are because of the
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
legislative intent would they would they
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
be locked to that or should we
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
U we we usually work with the sponsors
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
however it is usually best that the
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh text of the sign be part of the
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation or at least somehow made
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
clear that that was the legislative
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
intent um so that going back through
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
history we have the record uh of the leg
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm just saying that um I I
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
look back at some of the signs that have
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
been put up decades ago that we have to
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
restore or replace and we go back to the
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh the legislation for that information
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a discrepancy
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
that may not be easily discovered so if
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's possible an amendment or some sort
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
of notation um that's in the record
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
would would assist us but it is not it's
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
that I know that
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
um I know that several of the members
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
here have commitments for other
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
activities they have to be at today I uh
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
extremely appreciative the fact that
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
everyone has adjusted their schedule so
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
we could have a near maximum vote on
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
this because I know how we all feel
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
about this if um if I were to speak to
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
lob to pull an amendment with that
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
simple change would the uh committee be
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
willing to wait till uh 12:30 to uh to
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
exec this out repr
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
it's a single word for moving officer
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
and placing the chief and I would think
 
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
with the public acknowledgement here in
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
the faith in our chairman that we could
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
vote now with the understanding it's a
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
one-word amendment that the chairman
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
will take care of
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
sir thank you sir um I would submit to
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
the committee that I will be meeting
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
with the hos family and the governor
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
this afternoon at State Police
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
Headquarters uh for his
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
recognition um of the hos family and
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
other members of New Hampshire hospital
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
who were there on November 17th would it
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
potentially satisfy the the committee
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
that um the highway would be named in
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
his honor in a manner consistent with
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
the wishes of the hos family in terms of
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
title that way whatever it is that they
 
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
would say whether it's Chief or officer
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
I suspect they're going to appreciate
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
Chief would be something that you could
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
vote upon now and uh provided that I
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
could um uh guarantee to you by virtue
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
of my face-to-face conversation with the
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
hos family today what it is that they'd
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
like okay thank you sir yes sir so we we
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
are uh yes I'm sorry represent faul I
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
mean I was I I think I like the idea of
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I think we can express
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee and either
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
finalize it at 12:30 or finalize it on
 
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.029 align:start position:0%
finalize it at 12:30 or finalize it on
Thursday

00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we can announce now an executive
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
session for the lunch break on Thursday
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
or something I I I think we can we can
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
express the intent of the committee at
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
any rate I as as much as I Look to You
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I from what that conversation and the
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
delay unfortunately of where we have and
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
not having the mayor's letter I think
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's important that we vote this through
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
right now so that um these gentlemen and
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
and the governor have the opportunity to
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
say that it's been passed and we will um
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
like we can always go to the Senate and
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
have the change made I don't don't see
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be an issue we can
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
we can we can make we we could make when
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
the motion's made we could make the
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
motion that officer
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
I just we we need we need to resolve
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
this at this point in time yes the
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
chairman as a longtime member of this
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
committee we've done things like this
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
before so and there wasn't a lot of
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
controversy so I say I'm just pass an
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
amendment with the understanding that
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
you'd take work on changing it from
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
change it from officer to Chief and we
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
vote the bill off to pass today so we
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
can get to the floor by next week uh so
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
I would say go ahead I further further
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
discussion of the uh committee yes
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
please go ahead represent Boer I um also
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
support that idea of doing that I think
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's the most expedient way we could
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
deal with the situation as it is only a
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
one-word change Amendment and I think we
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
do have our faith in you that it would
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
be followed through
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay Gra Jack uh thank you this is not
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
exactly regular order but there is the
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of doing it with a floor
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
amendment when the bill comes to the
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
floor I know there are often technical
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections that are made that
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
way as as much as I would like to agree
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
with you my when we come to the floor
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
with this which won't be this week it'd
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
be the following week from my
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with the clerk and the
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
fam's the family's going to be in the
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
gallery I i' I'd rather not be doing
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
that uh so we could um someone could
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
offer um and we pass it with the upgrade
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
of the title and then if I need to make
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
a correction on the floor we can do that
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
repent Mr chairman I would move that the
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee authorize the chair to change
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
the word officer to the word Chief and
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
the motion be ought to pass with
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.270 align:start position:0%
the motion be ought to pass with
Amendment

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay so motion by Eaton I don't know who
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
the second was yeah represent melv
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
represent Melvin was a
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.069 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:45.079 --> 01:00:46.789 align:start position:0%
that
okay

01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
um when you have a chance uh we will
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
call the role if you're in favor of the
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
motion or of ought to pass with
 
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
motion or of ought to pass with
Amendment

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh signify by saying I if you're opposed
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so one question we're
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
voting on that that would be the
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
question I just asked thank you
 
01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:16.589 align:start position:0%
question I just asked thank you
okay

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
yes the amend changing that one word I I
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
think so and then then then that'll be
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
easier I think than than saying this was
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
passed with an Amendment we're going to
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that we would
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
the chief change officer Chief
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's cleaner and I'll
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll draft Amendment if need
 
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.029 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll draft Amendment if need
be

01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
please we're all set
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Mills

01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
is offered a
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
second uh before I take
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
discussion um for many years I have sat
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
here and heard the heartfelt concerns of
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
residents that live alongside our
 
01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.709 align:start position:0%
residents that live alongside our
highway

01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
system and um wish there was a way that
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
we could um we could
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
expend millions of dollars for that
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
purpose but
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the um federal guidelines
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
which permit a certain uh certain roads
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions with um spacing
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
between buildings and neighborhoods and
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
everything else comp Le Lex uh many
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
times many many times I believe the
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
department had a list of two or three
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
pages um that those projects uh do not
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
um do not meet that criteria which then
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
would would come from either general
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
fund or uh Highway expenses and as we
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
just came through the 10-year
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
plan especially with the turnpike uh
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's presently already leakage on um
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
on some of of our former
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
projects uh there's not been a
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
willingness to raise tolls for a great
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
number of years and
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
um so that the process isn't there the
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue is not there and we would I
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
believe as policy makers uh be an error
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
toh suggest to anyone that there is the
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
use of toll credits uh we have come to
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
find out from
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um has not been rising at any
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
any great degree and the need for those
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
toll credits for other projects um have
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
been ever becoming um ever increasingly
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh important uses to uh back up the
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
monies that we need for federal
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
programs the the method and the senator
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
and others
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
um I do not fault for bringing this
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
forward but the method of
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
funding uh this uh noise barrier
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
additions is taking our toll credits and
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
putting them out on the open market and
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
exchanging what other states might pay
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
for those credits to make this
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
fund and most times in in my life
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
experiences uh you you wouldn't see
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
states that are strapped for as much
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
money as we are uh offering a surplus
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
for those so as much as I think this is
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
a creative solution it's not the right
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
solution at this point and for those
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
reasons I offered U my motion further
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Jack uh thank you
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman one other item is if I
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
understood the testimony correctly
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact it's been authorized
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
for several years the marketplace has
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
never been actually set up so in that
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
sense the bill is premature and could be
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
brought forward if one actually is set
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
up thank you yes represent
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
fogner um I want to agree with the
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
Chairman's remarks entirely I just want
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that I think that we have
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
shied away from earmarks and for you
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
know in advance setting
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
aside um money from Individual projects
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
and types of projects so that uh I I
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
think this is an example if this were
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
new money coming from someplace that it
 
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.590 align:start position:0%
new money coming from someplace that it
might

01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
be different but I don't think we've
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
heard that there's any increase in in
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's coming with this so I
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
would would agree with the Ito thank you
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
sir any further discussion represent uh
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
yes as a longtime member of this
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm I'm sympathetic to the
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
people who want noise bears and I
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
believe we we put something in the
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
tenure plan using federal funds to
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
construct a noise bear around I95 in
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth so and that and that was the
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
first one just for everybody's
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
edification I first learned about this
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
issue in 1999 when I was on the
 
01:37:23.199 --> 01:37:24.189 align:start position:0%
issue in 1999 when I was on the
committee

01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the one of the members from
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth was a real she was a real
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate and she pushed for years and
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
she couldn't get it through you know but
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
eventually I think we put in in the last
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and I believe it's in
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmith only I mean it's a start it's
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
I I feel sad we can't do more but I
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
think right now the turnpike system
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
really needs more Revenue I don't know
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
what we do and I think we got to be
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
careful with our toll credits thank
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh further further comment
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
you yes please chairman um just as a
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
comment the more we widen the turnpike
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
the more we widen these roads the more
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
emphasis upfront in the project that
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
should be put on uh the the sound
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
barriers uh we're starting to encroach
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
on residential areas uh maybe uh schools
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
Etc what along the right away um I see
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
the project I see the widening on um the
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
Everett it looks like they're putting up
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
a wall on on northbound side as part of
 
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.950 align:start position:0%
a wall on on northbound side as part of
the

01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:39.149 --> 01:38:39.159 align:start position:0%
project I you like you mentioned you've
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
been you've seen this uh over and over
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
again and at some point we're gonna I I
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
would believe that the do via funding
 
01:38:52.589 --> 01:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
from from the legislator is going to
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
have to back on
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
something to mitigate noise I appreciate
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
the representative's comments any

01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%

thank

01:46:59.550 --> 01:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
you I U I have some concerns of sending
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
individuals over maybe they'll end up
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
staying so I yeah so I in all honesty
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to prepare yourself
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
if you've never been there before it's a
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
different uh it's not the women's prison
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
tour that we when many of us went on
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
previously so we will we will arrange
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that's a wonderful uh suggestion
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
that um that if there are people that
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
can't join us they typically will meet
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
over here we'll go over by a van and
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
they'll return us back here so unlike
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
the uh college system we don't usually
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
have lunch over there and from what we
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
what we've heard of their uh facility we
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
will decline that offer so um we have
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I believe we have
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I know if we've disposed of our last
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill I know there was we this was
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
the last one we had today today we still
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
have today's yeah today
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
he so what's the pleasure was if I don't
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
know if we're going to be in session
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
next week um would you like to see if
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
we're a lighter schedule that maybe we
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
convene after or during lunch of that to
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
take care of that business or would you
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
like to come in as a separate day I'm
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
open m Mr chair just that for
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's clarify when is the date
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we have have to have this bill out
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
I understand this is an early Bill
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
something about going to finance and I
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this is
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
necessary this now has an FN back on it
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
it well it yeah I think it has and there
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
some concerns uh that myself and some of
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
the other members that it might have to
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
go to a second which I assume would be F
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it does uh but I believe on
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
this okay all right let me let me speak
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
to the clerk and see what see what needs
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
to be done rep uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh on the bill uh
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
476 the question I have is I guess would
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
be to the treasur is if this would
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
affect the amount we would be able to
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
bond in the capital budget next year I
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a critical question for
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
this I I I believe that's a great
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
question so I don't I will ask our our
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
researcher to reach out to uh the
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer than excuse me Mr I'm sorry
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes please go right uh okay a request
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we could ask the treasurer to come
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
in and talk to us about this bill uh
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
because there some concerns Among Us
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
that how it's going to impact not only
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
this year but the next capital budget
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's a big amount of money so I've said
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions we get the treasure and
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
maybe even bring in the Attorney General
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%

were to go back
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%

01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
have to meet sooner than
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
