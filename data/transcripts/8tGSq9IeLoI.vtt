replacement clerk
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
today I know several representatives are
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
busy introducing other bills in the
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
Senate and um bouncing back and forth
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
between divisions one and too so we
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate those that are here
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
today we have 10 bills today uh to work
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
on that's the purpose of today's session
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
and they're all scheduled for 10
 
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 align:start position:0%
o'clock obviously that's going to be um
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
spaced my thought is this uh for
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
committee members that we my hope my aim
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
is perhaps 20 minutes of Bill I'm not
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to hold anyone to that here on the
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
committee here in the audience we're not
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to stop things at 20 minute but I
 
00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
would say keep it in mind because that's
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
approximately three bills an hour and
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
that would take us to uh
 
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
lunchtime it's my intention to break at
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
12:30 for lunch for an hour and then
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
resume and uh go from there so does
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
anybody have any thoughts with regards
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
to that landscape of today's plan
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
sounds good okay no votes today we're
 
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 align:start position:0%
meeting again on Friday in order to make
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the Full House
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee that's our purpose as a
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
division we make recommendations on
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
bills for then the full finance
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
committee to take up as a recommendation
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
to then recommend to the full house so
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation votes will occur on this
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
Friday Also at 10:00 a.m. is I believe
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
the scheduled time this Friday it's in
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
the calendar all these bills
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
incidentally have been published in the
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
latest calendar uh dated May
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
3rd all right anything from the members
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
related to anything at all all
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
right I'm gonna now uh turn it over to
 
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple who I have discussed with with
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
regards to this topic we have a surplus
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
and we have a tremendous amount of bills
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
that each come with a price tag and so
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
naturally as the house finance committee
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
with our particular purpose being the
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
finances and how much money is there and
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
how much money we have to spend and how
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
much can be spent and the total amounts
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth it's good to have just a
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what we're dealing with
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
before we proceed on today's schedule so
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
with that Mr Ripple I will introduce
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
you sure thank you so you should all
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
have in front of you a document titled
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2425 banial budget variance
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
May of 24 uh it's dated May 3rd and I
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
believe Mike Kane sent this out to all
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
the members of Finance last week as well
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
so I'll just briefly go through this to
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
give you an update on the state's
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
current fiscal
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
status you can see up top where it says
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 projected ending balances as
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
of June 23rd uh this is where the budget
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
assumed we would end up and as an aside
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
for division 3's purposes I'll be
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
focusing on General funds only but you
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
can see the impact on the education
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund here as
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
well the budget assumed we would end the
 
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
bium with a general fund balance of $3.2
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
million so that's the starting point for
 
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.910 align:start position:0%
million so that's the starting point for
this

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
document the items below that are
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
plan I'll ignore the first one 24
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
beginning fund balances and move on to
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
the second fiscal year 24 Revenue versus
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
plan through April and again uh in in
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
this case I should stress that revenues
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
are not forward-looking we're not making
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
any assumptions about the next year plus
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
worth of revenues uh this is where the
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
state stands compared to plan as of the
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
end of last
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
month and as of the end of last month in
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
$68.84 estimated
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
lapse and here actual lapse is a little
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
bit misleading because the agencies
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
haven't lapsed anything yet for this
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so this is itself an
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
estimate but it's an updated estimate
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the ones used during
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
preparation of the
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
budget we're assuming based on what Das
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
has told us that right now agencies will
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
lapse $ 34.3 million less than we
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
process the next line is the projected
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation variants and these are for
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
open warrant Appropriations in which the
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
state has to pay whatever the actual
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
costs are for example litigation was a
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
$7 million expense above what we assumed
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
in the budget uh Corrections Pharmacy
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
costs which went through the fiscal
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
committee are $5 million above what we
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
assumed in the budget so collectively
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
those appropriation variances assume
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
will be spending $24.9 million more uh
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
than expected during development of the
 
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.990 align:start position:0%
than expected during development of the
budget

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
the final item here are legislative
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
specials also known as bills so far two
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
of them have passed both bodies uh very
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
small bills totaling
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
$200,000 so the net effect of all that
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
is we'll have a revised ending balance
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
assuming everything remains as is which
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
is a big Assumption of $12.6 million at
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the banian that's compared to
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
the budget Assumption of $3.2 million so
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
as of right now
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
were $109.4 million to the
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
positive but I
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't take that number too
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
literally because there are a lot of big
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
unknowns for
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
example uh revenues for the next year
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
plus but in particular business tax
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
revenues in May and June those those are
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
always very big uh months for business
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
tax revenues and business taxes in
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
general have been trending down over the
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
last few months so that's something to
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
keep an eye
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
on also obviously the eventual outcome
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
of the YDC court case and any subsequent
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
court cases could have a big impact on
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
this figure and also the final agency
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
laps impact uh laps figures could impact
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
this in One Direction or the other so
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
that $109.4 million figure really is a
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
number so that's where we stand right
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
now if you move to the next page the
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
2425 appropriation bills this is a list
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
of all appropriation bills that are
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
still alive in either
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
body and again I'll Focus only on the
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
general fund impact here because you can
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
see a number of them have education
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
trust fund impacts other fund impacts
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
Etc I'll be ignoring those for the
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
moment if you go down to the total
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
Appropriations at the
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
bottom the general fund impact over the
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
two years is roughly $138 million so the
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
two bodies right now have $138 million
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
requests however there are two items
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
that I would add to that there is
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these rows aren't numbered
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
but if you go
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
about a little over a third down the
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
page you can see House Bill 1633 Canabis
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
legalization and
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
regulation that has an $8.1 million
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
liquor fund appropriation but that will
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
affect general fund Revenue so I would
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
consider that a general fund
 
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
consider that a general fund
impact

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
also down near the bottom Senate Bill
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
476 docc New Hampshire state prison for
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
men that has a uh General obligation
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
Bond of $40 million however that comes
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
at a cost in with uh in terms of debt
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
service to the general fund of $4.6
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
million so I would so those two
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
items total about $12.7 million and I
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
would add that to the $138 million
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation figure that you see here
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
so collectively there's about 50 $151
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
million uh general fund impact in terms
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
requests plus the unknowns you mentioned
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
the state is in litigation right there's
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus uh and revenue fluxes yes and
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
the like quite a few unknowns as well as
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
there are bills without Appropriations
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
right now that uh to which the Senate
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
could add Appropriations or other house
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
committees might add Appropriations so
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's we're in a state of flux
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
right now there are some unknowns but
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the big
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
picture very good thank you for that any
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative walner F
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
Wier thank you Mr Ripple Mr Ripple could
 
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
you remind us what the lapse the actual
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
lapse was at the end of the last bium
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
I I will have to take a look at that one
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head but
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
I can get it for you
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
shortly thank
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Wier thank you madam
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh April 30th I attended a meeting
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
of the arpa uh allocation requests and
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
was interesting to see that the senate
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
had put in additional requests pending
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility review of Sen Bill
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
406 which is the increase for shelter
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
rates Senate Bill 311 which is the
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hamstead property uh payment and Senate
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 396 the cost associated with
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
ventilation and exhaustion fans at the
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
uh Hudson
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
CTE they seem to think they can fund
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
them from these funds and I also
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
questioned only the only members of the
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
House were myself and the speaker why
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
there's no house bills also listed
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I was told by the um director of
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget send me the list so some of those
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
that we think are going to be difficult
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
I will try to come down to uh especially
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
most of these are not the biggest one
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
there was the 2 and A5 million for the
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
shelter rates and the the Hamstead one
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
is 54,000 and the the one at uh the CTE
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
is 67200 these are the other ones are
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
less than a million so we have bills
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we think we have priority for that
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
we see a problem with the other side I'm
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
going to bring them into the budget
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
director and ask that they be considered
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
for the uh any excess arpa funds because
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be all this year we'll be um
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the ones that can't be
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
constructed before 2026 if there's a
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
construction thing or some other way if
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
this is money that just goes to uh an
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
agency higher or to to expand then that
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
will be a lot easier to take that money
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
than for a construction project so I'll
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
be looking at those I'll be getting
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
together with Mr Ripple and the other uh
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
LBA folks to see which ones we really
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
want and see if there is room in these
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh reallocations of the arpa funds so
 
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:18.949 align:start position:0%
uh reallocations of the arpa funds so
thank

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
you representative tersi thank you madam
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
chair I just have a quick question for
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
the chairman wer do you have a estimate
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the arpa funds that are potentially
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
available for these one time projects so
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
we know sort of the
 
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.909 align:start position:0%
we know sort of the
pot

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
pot
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
um this figure says well the the Gopher
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
ones um has already 16 million in new
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
money request the total under the
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
additional legislative request that
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
looks like they're looking at
 
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.630 align:start position:0%
looks like they're looking at
8,842

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
77799 so yeah they're they're
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
reallocating all the time we will have
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
another arpa meeting probably later this
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
year so some of these things will be
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
then okay anything further for Mr Ripple
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
or on this
 
00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
or on this
topic

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
again so the thought here is to go bill
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
by Bill starting in order though there
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
are two bills we may be able to take up
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time but we'll get to that
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
352 that is
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
establishing an early detection cancer
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
screening pilot program for active and
 
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
screening pilot program for active and
retired

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters so this
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
bill summary of the docket if you want
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
the full docket please go to nh.gov but
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
a summary came out of Senate Health and
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services 5 to Z Sen Finance 7 to 0
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
full Senate 24 to0 house Health and
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee 20 to0 and
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
through the Full House on a Voice vote
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
two next I just want to look at the
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note while we're introducing this
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
particular segment of the work
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
session so the most recent fiscal note
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
is dated 32124 is that correct
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
yes okay not to exceed $5 million over
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
the periods between 2025 to
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
2027 okay anything further on the fiscal
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
note okay all right I understand there
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
are individuals here who are interested

give a brief overview of of the plan and
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
and what we're asking um app appreciate
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
it absolutely great thank so much um
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for mentioning the success
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill has had along the way
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
beginning first in the Senate uh and
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
then onto the house um with no um no
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
really debate or uh issues um along the
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
way this is a program that we U came
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
forward with uh the idea of uh
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
constructing last session um and members
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
of the House had requested that we uh
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
build out the program that is best
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
suited for firefighters um get access to
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts and really
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
identify the testing that needs to be
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
done um to uh detect cancer early in our
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters um just a a quick statistic
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
75% of the names that are added to the
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
Fallen Firefighters Memorial out in
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
Colorado Springs uh are members that
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
died from occupational cancer um and so
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
that is the precipice for why we're here
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
today um to move this program forward
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here is
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
establish a program uh that would allow
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
screening comprehensive uh cancer
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
screening to uh all professional active
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
and retired firefighters throughout the
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we want to
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
compile the data that's necessary to
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
look at how we drive long-term uh a
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
long-term program that is purposeful and
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
impactful for our members um just a a
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
quick anecdote uh right across the
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
street right now as we speak at the
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
holiday in uh our our firefighting
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
organization uh is actually screening
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
100 uh members firefighters um that are
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
that have attended our banial convention
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
we raised the funding for that uh we
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
raised about
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
$175,000 to screen these members this is
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
how important this program is to us um
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're stepping up to initiate this
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
process and hoping that the state will
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh come forward um with this this amount
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
of money this $5 million to help screen
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state um and with that
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would kick it over to Dr Hamrock to
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
give more a more comprehensive approach
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
here as to why we chose the test that we
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
did um and then Madam chair if we would
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
have a few minutes after just to discuss
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
a possible change uh to the the bill as
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
is I would appreciate that thank
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
you Doctor when you're ready thank you
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
Brian I I want to thank all the uh
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
members of division 3 committee for
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify today uh as I
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
introduce myself Dr Michael Hamrock I'm
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
a primary care and addiction medicine
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
doc at St Elizabeth's Medical Center in
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
Boston and I'm here to strongly Advocate
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh for this bill for early detection
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
screening pilot program for firefighters
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I believe I have a
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
unique perspective on firefighter health
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
issues as a former Boston firefighter
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
and a medical director of the Boston
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
fire department I currently take care a
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
lot of firefighters with uh as a primary
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
care physici and we have a early
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
detection screening program at my
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
hospital where we screen uh the early
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
detection screening test to pick up
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
early heart disease and cancer and first
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
respond as then I can tell over the past
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
two years we saved the lives of 13
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
firefighters with these early detection
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
screening tests finding cancer at an
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
early stage uh I also developed uh
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
cience of physical exams for
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters a template that's used
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
across the country for Primary Care
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
Providers I'm also a co-author of a book
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
called surviving the fire service that
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
explains the unique risk firefighters
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
have for health issues and I'm also
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
a member of the firefighter canc support
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
network as a as a medical advisory uh
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
doctor there and I've been uh named the
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
past four years as and Boston Magazine's
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh top top doct
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
list but so the reason I'm here you know
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
really my goal is to have firefighters
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
across the country get these early
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
detection screenings I believe it's
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
going to save the lives of Hampshire
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters like we've have in Boston
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
and we all know now there's a four times
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
better chance of surviving uh in the
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
stage one two cancer from these early
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
detection tests versus stage three and
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
four cancer uh and we we all know the
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
the tremendous stress that cancer has on
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters in our families and
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
financial stress as well and I believe
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
this early detection test will save uh
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax pays money as well by
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
finding these cancas early the firef
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully can stay work and won't go off
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
on injur a sick leave and won't have to
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
retire early so everyone benefits from
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
these tests and I also believe it allows
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
firefighter to be more safe and
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
effective on a fire ground ground by
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
having a healthy
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
Workforce the other thing about these
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
tests if you do find a lung nod on a
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
fire figh with these CAT scans they
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
automatically have that diagnosis our a
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
lung nodule so from for the next 30
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
years or however old the fire fighter is
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
the fall up Skins are covered by the
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company not by the state uh
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
any anymore because they own that
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a lung nodule so it doesn't
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
have to be uh yearly tested or picked up
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
by the state uh but the bottom line is
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
I've lot too many good friends and uh
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues from firefighter cancer uh
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and and I think a lot of them died
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
needlessly because we didn't have these
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
tests available back then and and and
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
that's really why I'm asking your
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill for early detection
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
screenings we all know firefighting is a
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
great occupation the sense of
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
comaraderie the morale the uh you know
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
tremendous reward of saving people's
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
lives but because that firefighters pay
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
a huge price being part of the
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
firefighter family and and we all know
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters come on a job healthy go
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
through the physical ability test go
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
through the academy but unfortunately we
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
see several years after that tremendous
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
health issues with firefighters
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
including heart disease and cancer
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
conditions the National Institute of
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
occupation safety and health did a study
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh 30 year study completed in 2020 and
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
and looked at cancer and firefighters
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
they looked at 30,000 firefighters in
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
Chicago San Francisco and Philadelphia
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
and they actually found that the
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters have a 9% higher rated of
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
cancer than the general population and
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately 14% higher rate of dying
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
from cancer than the general population
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh in Boston we see three cancers every
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
every month in our firefighters we
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
average 20 per year and and
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately several members are very
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
sick right now probably won't make it
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
through through the year in each case
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
cost the city over quar million dollars
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
so we spend over $5 million a year just
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
in cancer cases alone the fire
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
department uh so my goal is to have more
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
early detection so these firefighters uh
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
if they do get cancer caught in an early
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
stage and and and very successfully
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
treated and save the taxpayers in Boston
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
like myself money as well uh by having
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
these early detection
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
tests the World Health Organization uh
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
came up with a new report uh their
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
International Agency for cancer research
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2023 and they now
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
reclassify firefighting as a
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing occupation group one
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
which is the highest level so you know
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
right away when you take this job you'll
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
walk into our professionals there's a
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
good chance it's going to give you
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
cancer and get another reason why we
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
need to do something for the
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters and get these early
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
detection screenings on
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
board Governor Baker Massachusetts in
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
2018 passed a a bill um basically stated
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
that uh firefigher develop cancer it's a
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
job related injury and they should be
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
covered uh immediately because of that
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
and and we had 3005 fighters in
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts two years prior to that
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
develop caner kind of instigated uh
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
pushing up Bill there's also additional
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
money in the mass fireing cry budget to
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
screen firefighters with these early
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
detection screening test as well in
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
hopes we can prevent firefighters from
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
getting cancer if they do get it it'll
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
be successfully
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
treated so I think the big question is
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know why do firefighters develop
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
cancer versus maybe other
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
professions we know when the combustion
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
of products in our home like these uh
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
the the chairs we're sitting in today
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
they all contain flame and
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
prevent the fire from spreading but we
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
know when these uh materials combust
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
they give off dangerous cancer causing
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
chemicals at the fire foter is inhale
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
and ingest and absorb into the skin and
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
cancer develop several years later we
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
also know smoldering Plastics and syn
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
synthetics in people's homes give off
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
poly aromatic hydrocarbons and uh they
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
give cancer and firefighter as well and
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
even diesel exhaust hanging around the
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
firehouse you don't have to be go to
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
fires every day but it's hanging around
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
the firehouse with a de exhaust
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
particles uh gives uh promotes cancer as
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
well particularly uh kidney cancer and
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
bladder cancer I give you one example in
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
one of our firhouse in Boston and J in
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
the North End the kitchen is right off
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
the main floor and the apparatus goes in
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
and out of there blowing the diesel
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
exhaust right into the kitchen and the
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
walls are kind of dark in there because
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
of that and the plates have a have a
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
dark tens to them because of that and we
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
had three firefighters in a year and a
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
half develop kidney cancer most likely
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
because of that effect and fortunately
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
we got dies dies exhaust vents in the
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
fires now to hopefully prevent that from
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
happening another example is we had
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
engine 7's house in the Back Bay they
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
they bought a brand new flat screen TV
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh from one of the local dealers six
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
months later the TV stopped working it
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
was in the second floor of the firehouse
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
where all the firefighters congregate
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
and they brought it back to the dealer
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
and he open up the back of it he said
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
this does not look like the TV I sold it
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
six months ago there was three inches of
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
diesel exhaust particle in the back of
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
the TV this is what the TV absorbed you
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
know for six months can you imagine what
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
the firefighters are doing working in
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
that firehouse and really exposed to
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
these dangerous
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals the other big risk factor of a
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
cancer in firefight is it's a p fast
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
chemicals you might have heard about
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
recently poly floral alkal substances
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
that are in the firefighters gear
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're in the the form that the
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters use and they're in the
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
firehouse dust because of the leak off
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
from the gear and it's a huge risk
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
factor for cancer
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
now so it's all these risk factors that
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
put firefi risk uh for cancer and all
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
these chemicals these dangerous
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals the fers in the
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
heel into the mouth into the lungs they
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
ingest through the mouth into the
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
stomach and they also absorb through the
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
skin and all these chemicals make their
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
way into the bloodstream of the
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh cause cell mutation cell
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
damage and many years later the cancer
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
develops into firefighters and that's
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
the that's the true mechanism of cancer
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
and firefighters and can you imagine
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
today if there was a fire tonight in
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
conquer Massachusetts and
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh maybe some of the firefighters
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
checked down to the TD gu on Boston City
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
Bruns on Friday if people sitting beside
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
those firefighters you can still smell
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
tra of smoke coming from their body this
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
is from a fire uh three and a half days
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
previously and that's all these toxic
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
chemicals making the way out to the
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters pors and uh we see this a
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
lot in firefighters and after every big
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
fire we know they're going to uh smell
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
like that for several days after each
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
fire no matter how many showers they
 
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
fire no matter how many showers they
take

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
so when you think about these risk
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
factors fir Fighters have and what type
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
of cances are fir fighter getting that
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
kind of really goes into why we needed
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
screenings particular uh screenings for
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters that detect these cancers
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
that firefighters getting if you think
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
about the mechanism we just talked about
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
the inhalation uh the absorption uh and
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
the direct
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
exposure we see a lot of respiratory
 
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
tract Cancers and firefighters when
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
these uh chem chemicals come in dig T of
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
cancers esophagus colon stomach and we
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
also see a lot of neurogen urogenital
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
cancers from the uh way to cancer comes
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
in the chemicals come in but also the
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
way to eliminate through the body kidney
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
cancer bladder cancer testicular cancer
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
ovarian cancer and female fir Fighters
 
00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:45.789 align:start position:0%
ovarian cancer and female fir Fighters
is

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
huge and we also see skin cancers just
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
from direct exposure and we see blood
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
cancers and Fir Fighters Leukemia and
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
Lymphoma and multim Myoma as
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
well one big concern we see now is as
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
more woman firefighters come on the job
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
we getting better studies on women
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters have particular high risk
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
certain cancers particular their thyroid
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
Harkins lymphoma breast cancer and
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
uterine cancer so it's really
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
significant problem and these past
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
chemicals are also intro inter
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
interfering with their reproductive
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
system and we're seeing a lot of uh
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
infertility and female Firs because of
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
that and also some uh miscarriages
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some birth effects in
 
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
their children which is awful thing to
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
see another good reason why we need
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
these early early detection
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
screenings so these P fast chemicals
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
that I talked about you know they're in
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
the firefighter the three Linings of the
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
firefighters bunker gear so the typical
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
fire or even just hanging around the
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
fire house with the gear you know
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
through whether it be sunlight water
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
exposure or heat or just wear and tear
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
these PE fast chemicals come off the
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
firefighters gear uh the firefighters
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
inhale them and adjust them as well C up
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
on a firefighter dust floor and it's
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
been many studies and firefighters now
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
looking at uh the blood after a fire or
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
even a week or so after uh being in the
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
firehouse the blood levels and
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
firefighters are much higher than the
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
general population of this past chemical
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
because of their exposures to the bunker
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
gear that they're actually wearing which
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh to me is
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and and we know these uh P
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
fast chemicals are causing testicular
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
kidney Cancers and firefighters and and
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's also some new studies showing
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing cancer on the younger
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters too was a general TR across
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
the country for the general public but
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
we see them more and younger
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh as
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
well because of all this I think the
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
fire service has been pretty proactive
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
about U making firefighters more aware
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
of that be much more careful on the fire
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
ground makeing sure you're wearing your
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh breathing apparatus uh make sure your
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
gears on properly we have firefighters
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
take a shower immediately after uh
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
fighting a fire
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh we wash the gear immediately after
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
fires uh we get a vigorous workout 24
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
hours after a fire to get rid of some of
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
these toxins through the skin as well uh
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
but despite that we see still seeing
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
some issues and that's why we need these
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
early detection screening programs and
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be much more proactive with
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
these with these screening programs I
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
difference so I'm convinced these
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
screenings do stabiliz uh and did not
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
meant to replace the good physical exam
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a complimentary test an addition to
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
the physical exam uh the problem I see
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
with the the typical screenings that we
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
all get from the US preventive task
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
force uh it's meant for the general
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
public but the firefights need
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
additional screening because of those
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
RIS that I mentioned so the typical
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
screening physical exam is not enough of
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters actually you're missing
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
about 70% of cancers and firefighters
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the traditional screening test that
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have been doing uh we know the
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
lung uh scans actually reduce cancer by
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
20 reduceed death by 20% now which is
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
pretty remarkable these lung
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
scans so again I push for advocating
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
these screening tests for Fighters with
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
these high-risk cancers the respirat
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
tract the gener urinary tract uh the
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
blood cancers and the skin cancers and
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
the uh digestive
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
cancers so one of the tests we're
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
talking about is this multi-cancer early
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
detection blood test a gallery company
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
makes it it can detect up 50 different
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
types of cancer in one blood draw
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty unique technology where
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
all our cancer cells leak DNA in the
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
bloodstream but these tests can detect
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually cancer cells a special chemical
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
on the cancer cell and that in the DNA
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
that they can actually pick up and
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually track back what organ it came
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
from so they're pretty remarkable test
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
and in 15,000 firefighters across the
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
country have' already had these tests
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
done and we found a lot of early Cancers
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
and successfully treated and it has
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
saved lives uh you know also where I
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
work Boston we have Dana FAA Cancer
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
Institute masteral hospital is using
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
these early detection blood tests as
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
well uh in the early detection blood
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
screening program and these are two
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized uh cancer centers
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
country so I believe these tests are
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to fill the Gap in the
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
screenings that we do not currently have
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
for our
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters other test that I talked
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
about earlier chest CAT scans and
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters because of the issues bre
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
in these chemicals and affecting their
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
respiratory system digestive cancers
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
early age colonoscopies in 5 foots I
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
like to start at age 40 I believe
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
abdominal ultrasounds will help as well
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
looking at certain organs that may be
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
impacted by
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
cancers and the eurogen to cancers I
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
believe female firefighters should get
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
early age mammograms and pelvic
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds early uh and and male
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
firefighter should get testicular
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds as
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
well and uh that delivery blood test
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
will help uh that multi-cancer early
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
detection blood test will help all these
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
cancers as well as the blood cancers
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
that fire fighs are
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
getting one example of lung skin in
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
Boston we had 218 firefighters go
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
through the test 30% actually had lung
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
nodules that's almost one out every
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
three firefighters and these lung NOS uh
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
could predispose them to developing a
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
cancer so they have to be follow very
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
closely by their primary dock in a lung
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
specialist as well Manchester uh New
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire firefighter has went through a
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
similar screening test and 16 of their
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
120 members actually had lung nodules
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
that are going to be followed closely we
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
had one firefight in Boston last year
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
had two lung nodules they were they were
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
fairly large in size they end up being
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
cancerous he had his lung reector and
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he's doing well and and
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
disease so again just these lung scans
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't just show the lungs though we've
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of uh esophageal thickening
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
that could be uh cancer of esophagus as
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
well we found a lot of anisms on our
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
firefighters with these lung scans uh
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of kidney lesions
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
and liver lesions we found with these
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
lung skins as well and it has been very
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
impactful so so I just want to summarize
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
you know what we just talked about and
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
it is the fire ground and the fire host
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
that are putting firef at risk for
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
cancer we now know the World Health
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
Organization classifies uh firefighter
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
as a group one cancer causing occupation
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
and and we know the high-risk uh organs
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
that are involved in the fire service
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
now as well and I believe we need
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
additional screening test beyond what
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
the physical uh typical physical that
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
getting so I am very convinced that
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
these fire these screening tests will
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
save the lives New Hampshire
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters it's going to save the
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in New Hampshire money from
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
injury disability and overtime cost as
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
well and it hopefully eliminate the
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous stress that firefighters
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
families go through
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
the other think is going to help boost
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
recruiting if the state has a program in
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
place it's going to screen firefighters
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
for a disease that the we know the
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
occupation is going to cause I think
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's a huge huge boost for recruiting so
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for having me
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
present today and uh talking about
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
me thank you very much for all that uh
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
very well detailed information and
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
obviously your background uh you know
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
know about these things very thoroughly
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and I'm sorry to
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
hear about all the sufferings that
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
people who dedicate their lives to
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
protecting the public have to
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
undergo these things are not taken
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
lightly here thank
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
you representative wer uh thank you Dr
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hamrock you might have this
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
information how expensive is it to do a
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
blood test for past that
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
specifically so the past you know not
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
every lab does these fast blood testing
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know he's basically looking for this
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
chemical that the firef is exposed to uh
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if in University of Arizona
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
is doing a huge study now on fireflies
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
across the country with these tests uh
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
but I suspect they go about $200 but the
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
test itself means that you're exposed to
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
the chemical you know it doesn't say you
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
have cancer it just shows that you
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
exposed to this chemical it's the early
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
cancer detection test that's uh more
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
effective that will determine is this
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
firefighter have uh potential cancer in
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
the body
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm thinking of that for a
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
wider thing for the whole state because
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend a lot of money on
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
on water treatment and I wonder how much
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
we already all of us have been exposed
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
before we spend a lot of money on water
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
treatment so I wonder how expensive that
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
test would be the P fast material is
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
also in in paper products and things
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
that when you buy from stores it's it's
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere but it's firi are much
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
highly exposed to
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Lon followed by
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
by representative priest um thank you
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you doctor for
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
being here for this um I'm actually on
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
and I had a lot of questions I had to
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
ask to other people since I know that
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
you were busy um seeing patients that
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
day um and Madam chair if you'd indulge
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
me with a few questions um my first is
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
um about this Gallery test um why this
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
test and what's the cost per
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
test the cost per test I believe is
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
about $900 for the general public I know
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
they have a pro program for the service
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
I believe they're about
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
$650 thank you that's helpful do you
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
know the sensitivity and specificity of
 
00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:35.470 align:start position:0%
know the sensitivity and specificity of
this

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
see sorry and for those of us who
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
haven't been in the diagnostic spacer in
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
medical school that's how many um false
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
negatives so the literature that I see
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
from uh the company is still you know
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
they're looking at much more uh
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
screening tests they really bringing ac
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
across this country as well as Europe
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
but uh the literature shows that
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh they have false positive test uh less
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
than 1% spec specificity that's
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of true negatives is greater
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
than 99% that's the literature okay
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and do you know how many of
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the detected cancers have no treatment
 
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
at the stage of diagnos diagnosis and if
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's any clinical history for those
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
cancers at stage one or stage two if
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
they're not commonly found well every
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
every Cancer no matter what stage it has
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
is Treatment available uh but obviously
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
you want to find cancer at stage one and
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
two uh the literature I hear from the
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
blood testing company about 50% of the
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
cancer they find are in stage one and
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
two um sorry you said that every cancer
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
has treatments available correct great
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you I was not aware of
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
that fact I mean um you go to Dana FAA
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
today with any typ of cancer you're
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
going to get treatment for it oh those
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
with tests thank you um and then do you
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
know um what happens if the manufacturer
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
changes this test since it's still in
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
clinical trials or if they cease to make
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
this test available before this pilot
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
program is
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
done what I understand they're learning
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
from every every every test that they do
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
they they're learning about it and
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh make it more sensitive down
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
the road uh but again you know 15,5
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
across the country been through this
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
test and it's used uh regularly at Daya
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
fa can Institute in Mass General
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital as well because they have a
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
high faith in this test um thank you do
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
you know if those 15,000 um firefighters
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
were part of the clinical trials or if
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
it's done in a different program they're
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
currently enrolling 35,000 people in
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
order to test this to see about the
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
validity and effectiveness of this test
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
it's in its own study with the fire
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
service uh not they not in that
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
population there also a test under away
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
with Medicare patients uh 50,000
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
patients are enrolled in it right now um
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
would it be a Poss possible for to have
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
instead of paying for this in the state
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
for $600 a test to instead collaborate
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
um to have New Hampshire firefighters
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
included in a clinical trial for this
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
because it probably could reach to other
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
states as well and not have the
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay for an investigational
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
test would that be a possibility if we
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
were to remove this multi-cancer early
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
early detection blood test from this
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
bill and have um and pursue this through
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
clinical trials which the company should
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
be able to support instead of the
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers supporting yet oh you number
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
one I'm not going to speak to New
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire firefighters or or the or the
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
company which I don't work for have any
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
stake in at all and if I just have one
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
last question and then my question would
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
be um if you know why Dana Farber and
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
Mass General are not participating in
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial for
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
this I don't know what the what trials
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
are actually participating in they're
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
actually putting a thousand uh veterans
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh through a program at Dana faan now
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
with his early detection cancer test
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry for getting so deep
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
in the weeds I did a lot of diagnostic
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
approvals and bringing them to Market

firefighters um have died of
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
cancer in the past and have been
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer now I don't know
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
what happen National number I can say in
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
Boston we had 195 Fighters over the past

23 years ding from cancer then I'll ask
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
the representative from new do you have
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%

Hampshire of
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
firefighters having being diagnosed of
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
cancer on their jobs or having died of

numbers what I can tell you um is over
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the last well I
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
have about eight to 10 names here that
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
over the last uh 10 years have died from
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
occupational cancer in the state of New
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Alone um and we we have
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
someone here uh that's behind us that
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
has a very personal story um that he's
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
willing to share with you all um as to
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
how this impacts you know one
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
firefighter death how this impact
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody in New Hampshire can I follow
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
up please follow up thank you um
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
and this question is for both of you um
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
you you Doctor you made a mention that
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
um monies could be saved by early
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
Detention of cancer do you have a kind
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
of case study of how much money was
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
saved by uh detecting cancer at stage
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
one and stage two and how much cost
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
would be for the disability cost and and
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
the ongoing Medical C
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
treatments the literature that I read
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
has uh finding cancer stage one and two
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
half thank you representative tersi
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair I want
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
to thank you so much for taking the time
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and coming up here to um share your
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge with us on this very important
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
issue um I do want to um I know we've
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
all received some information that there
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
actually is some changes requested to
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
the bill so in the consideration of time
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have U Mr real go down what
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
are yes Mr R you have proposed a very
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
clear Amendment uh that you would like
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
to suggest and I certainly appreciate
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
the way you have formatted it to make it
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
Crystal what you're looking for if you
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
could take us through that at this time
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the opportunity um as
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
Dr Hamrock mentioned uh the the World
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
Health Organization says that uh the the
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
cost for early detection cancer
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
diagnosis uh is two to four times uh a
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
cost savings to that of a late St stage
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um so when we when we talk
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
about costs there is a cost impact here
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire it's not
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
only lives uh potentially saved um but
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is a true fiscal cost uh savings to
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
to uh early detection programs um so we
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
are not asking for a change to the
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
overall fiscal note of this bill which
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
is $5 million what we have requested is
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh two minor changes one would be to
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
remove the skin cancer screening portion
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh the reason for that is we um
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
understand that the $5 million is a
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
significant cost um and we're trying to
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
be as fiscally uh prudent as possible
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
with this we know that our members uh
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
have access to uh Dermatology exams
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
through their uh insurance companies as
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
it stands today so um if I were to go to
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
my PCP I could um tell them you know I
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
want to get a skin cancer screening um
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
he may or may not ask why um but then I
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
would get a referral um to get that
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
screening that doesn't happen with some
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
of these other tests so what we're
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to ensure is that we're spending
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
State funds as responsibly as possible
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
so we would ask for the removal of that
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
piece and we would take it upon
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves to educate our members to get
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
out and get these screenings um the
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
second piece would be the removal of the
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
$1300 cap per person um the only reason
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
for that is to uh adjust for inflation
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I had a good conversation with a
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
couple folks on this committee uh about
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
the importance of that some of the tests
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we've looked at um we base this
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
$1,300 number on current costs as this
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
thing is progressed we know that uh the
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
cost of uh one of the tests has gone up
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
about $100 so we don't want to hamstring
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
um our members we want them to have
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
access to every portion of the test um
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
and we do believe that there would still
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
be enough money within that $5 million
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
to get that done um and then as is
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
written in here any funds that are not
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
expent would then go back to the state
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
so we would um we would request those
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
two minor changes from this
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative tar
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I just have one um
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
quick question based on your requested
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I believe we've already
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
submitted um for drafting um do you feel
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
if we lift the cap that you'll still be
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
able to reach all of the um firefighters
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
that you hope to reach with that $5
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
million ultimate uh ceiling yes thank
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative I I
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
believe that to be true um the reason
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
for that is um
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is no matter how much we
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
educate our members and push them into
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
this not everyone's going to probably
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
get the screening that's just by the
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
nature of uh all of us right is a lot of
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
us probably uh in this room may not even
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
have a primary care position
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so um it's hard to uh get
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
folks to do that this money um would
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
account for if every firefighter in the
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
state got all portions of the screening
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier across the street
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
right now um we have 100 firefighters
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
that are already getting the blood test
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
and the ultrasound diagnostic they would
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
not then need to repeat those tests
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
should this bill passed um so there we
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
would come in um I have a strong belief
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
we would come in under wait under the
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
five million thank you very much for
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
that clarification that's
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
valuable with regards to the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
cap um you and I discussed this in
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
section Roman 6 of the bill still the
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
number 1300 is there and not your
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
intention to take that
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
out correct thank you um yes the reason
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
we left that piece in there was simply
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
if someone was to seek reimbursement if
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
they went off and got uh any portion of
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
these tests or all portions of these
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
tests on their own we wanted some uh
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
ability for them to come and seek for
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh but we wanted that to
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
be within reason we didn't want someone
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
to go out uh and get these these tests
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
done at
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
$110,000 and then come seek
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for $110,000 when the
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
tests are available for less expensive
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
than that so we just want to as a
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
safeguard for the state to make sure
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
that we're we're being reasonable with
 
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:43.390 align:start position:0%
that we're we're being reasonable with
our

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursements okay and then with regard
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
to section Roman five where you do take
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
out the cap is it your thought that I
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
mean could you say that most will exceed
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
1300 or most will not or it's to hard to
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
tell or there's a a mixture of who would
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
exceed and who wouldn't what is your
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
thought there so that's a that's a great
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh I think it would
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
be part of it would be dependent on the
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
other piece the skin cancer screening um
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'll give you for instance um we had uh
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
a member who just recently got their
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
skin cancer screening and their
 
00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:20.799 align:start position:0%
insurance covered it however the cost of
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
that test alone was just shy of $1,000
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
doll so if that wasn't removed and a
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
member went and got their skin cancer
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
screening and the state paid $1,000
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
towards it they would only then have
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
$300 left to cover what is
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
about $1,500 in testing um so they would
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
more more than likely exceed that now if
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
we removed the skin cancer screening
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
piece I believe the $1,300 will be close
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I believe that if this program
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
went out through the state's bidding
 
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.109 align:start position:0%
went out through the state's bidding
process

00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
um that there would be vendors that
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
would be able to come in at under say
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
$2,000 per test somewhere around
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you and represent ters
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
you said you're going to have his
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
suggested Amendment exactly as he
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
described it drafted it's already been
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
drafted I believe Mr Ripple has it okay
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
I have two versions of that Amendment
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
one for representative tersi and a
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
slightly different version for
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative wer that changes the 1300
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
to 1400 um but as as I look at this now
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
it changes the 1300 in Roman 5 but not
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
in Roman 6 so if you were to adopt
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative wier's Amendment we
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
probably want to make that change as
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
well um but I can hand out one or both
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
of those amendments now whichever you'd
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
prefer Mr will thank you um and um thank
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
you representative wer for having a
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
phone conversation with me the other day
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
and uh it was you were you were gracious
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
enough to give me some time to express
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
what we were looking to do I may have
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
missed spoke or misled you to believe
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we were at the $1,400 range uh My
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
Hope was that we could just remove that
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
cap um and let the the the process play
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
out knowing that there will be um a
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
state bitting process that we'll keep
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
we'll drive the cost of these down as
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
low as we can as well thank you if the
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
sponsors are okay I don't see a problem
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
distribution at this point no votes
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
today as I mentioned but something for
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
us to consider as we go forward that's
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh what we're charged with today
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon followed by
 
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative priest um yes Madam chair
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
I had an amendment that was drafted in
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
that we didn't offer because we simply
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
ran out of time and so I can have that
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
printed to distribute that removed the
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
multi-cancer blood screening section um
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
and gave a little bit more flexibility
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
in the Contracting so if that's helpful
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
I can have that printed and distributed
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
as well uh that's fine and if you could
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
send it to us once it's drafted that
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
would be helpful but you're saying that
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
your proposed
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
amendment suggests that we remove the
 
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
amendment suggests that we remove the
blood

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
blood
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
testing the blood test from uh section
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
Roman a Roman one lowercase
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
a um yes it actually it removes all of
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
section B um because the specificity on
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic ultrasound I don't think
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
is NE necessity in how they contract it
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
because it sounds that those people who
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
are doing it are already well versed in
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
what's needed um and this may bind their
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
ability to do what they need to do
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
should things change um we actually had
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
I had had that drafted we had to act by
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
noon and I received it at 11:40 which is
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
why the committee didn't adopt it and
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
why the committee said that this was
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
important and that's why we moved 20 to
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
zero to pass this along even though the
 
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
policy side was not fully
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
settled representative walner yes I I
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
would like to have um for Dr hanr Rock
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
to maybe speak to even though we don't
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
have the amendment in front of us speak
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
to what that Amendment would mean um for
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters thank
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
you now I'm a big fan of of the multic
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
cancer earlyer detection test because as
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
I mentioned previously the unique risk
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
of fire5 is half of cancer and all these
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
organ systems respiratory system
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
gastrointestinal genital urinary uh skin
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
and blood cancers that uh are typical
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
screening tests Miss 70% of those
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
cancers are typical physical exam that
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
firefighters get and and that's why I
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
believe these multic cancer early
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
detection tests are necessary for these
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
high-risk uh this high-risk occupation
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm convinced it will save lives so
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
necessary representative
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
priest thank you um uh Madam chairman
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
and I have a question for representative
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
Lan what was the purpose and the reason
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
behind removing this multi- blood test
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's actually a very good
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
question so this blood test Gallery is
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
made by or this blood test Grail is made
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
by a company called Gallery um it had
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
been spun off from a company then it was
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
reacquired recently both the United
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
States and the European Union raised
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
Anti-Trust concerns so this company that
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
was acquired for 10 billion and has now
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
been written down to I believe a three
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
billion doll company is being forcibly
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
spun off or launched an IPO the
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
challenge here is that their annual
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
revenues are about 100 million a year
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
while their operating cost their burn
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
rate is 800 million a year given that
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
they do not yet have FDA approval and
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
this is done as a Clea lab test so this
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
is a specialty test at approved labs and
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's very much of a one-off test at this
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
point as far as when you look at both
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and reimbursement because
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
this does not have an approval as a
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
quote unquote FDA approved test but is
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
available to the clear process there's a
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
huge amount of uncertainty as to what
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
the cost of regulatory approval would be
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the company would be
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
able to be viable as an ongoing company
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
by the time that this pilot program
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
exists um given the Dynamics of the
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
market given the uncertainty around the
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
diagnostic space given the challenge
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
other competitors in the space have had
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
in order to bring a mar a a product like
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
this to Market even after bringing other
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
novel Diagnostics to Market I'm highly
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that that roll out will not be
 
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
concerned that that roll out will not be
successful

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
and by naming a test that may not
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
actually be available because the
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
company may not be functional it
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely hamstrings what the state
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
would be doing it would give false hope
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the firefighters and it also would
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
take away from the fact that we need to
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
be doing these lung CT SC SC um
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
screenings we need to be doing these
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
ultrasound screenings I think that we
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
should focus on those that we know will
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
be available through this time period
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and going forward as opposed to one that
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
may simply be a victim of the Capital
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
markets and may not not actually be
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
available in the future or even for the
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
length of this pilot
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
program thank you and I have a follow-up
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
question to uh the doctor
 
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.470 align:start position:0%
question to uh the doctor
Hamrock

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hamrock
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that this this bill
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
just provides the option for
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters to to be screened and to
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
take the early test to detect cancer and
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that that's correct cor right how many
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters um do you estimate will be
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
participating and will'll be doing this
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
voluntarily my goal would have everyone
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to actually participate in this
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
test because I I've seen it be very very
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
effective and I can understand there
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
rep's concern with the business aspect
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
of it but I can tell the science behind
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
it uh is very conclusive that it is an
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
effective test and and it's why Folks At
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
The Dana fire Mass General are using
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
this test now and uh you know it's been
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
vetted by their teams as well and they
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
speak very highly of this test so I my
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
goal to have everyone eligible to take
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
this test in New Hampshire fire service
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
retirees and active members because I
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
think we're going to find early disease
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to be treatable and
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully these firefighters who have it
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh will be able to stay working and the
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters can enjoy the
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
retirement years even further because of
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the results of this
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
test thank you so just to in project on
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note representative under the
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
methodology it does State there are
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
3,626 individuals that would be
 
01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.589 align:start position:0%
3,626 individuals that would be
considered

01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
eligible if that's
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
helpful yes Mr re thank you man chair um
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
I would just like to draw attention to a
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
couple items here because I don't I want
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone's got factual
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
information um this nowhere in this bill
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
does it identify who a specific vendor
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
is to provide any of these tests this
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
will go through the state's bidding
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
process just as anything else does um I
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh representative lon's
 
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
concerns um but if they are not if if
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
the company that she's referring to is
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
not a solvent company that wants to bid
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
on this process others have the
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so whether it's
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock or it's Dana Farber
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
or whoever else wants to provide the
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
test um that has the capabilities to do
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
so they are eligible to bid on it
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
secondly um I would like to draw
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
attention to the fact that this has
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
already been vetted by two policy
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
committees um we're I would hope that
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
we're just discussing the financial
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
aspect of this which is why we were
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
bringing forward some ideas to um keep
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
track of uh the finances and make sure
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we were responsible in our
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
presentation to you all um I I was a
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
part of th those those conversations
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
with you all in the policy committee um
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
and this was uh we've seen positive
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
votes across the board for this so thank
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh representative
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you um I would appreciate
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
any followup with any other companies
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
that offer these diagnostic tests
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
because I as far as I'm aware the one
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
that you're speaking of has is far more
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
advanced than anything else available
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that there's anything
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
else would be available to backfill so
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like that information and second um
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
I do challenge the the the statement
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
that it was fully vetted by our policy
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
committee um as you were aware I I'm
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
very glad that I'm able to speak to the
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
doctor today I was asking lay people
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
specific diagnostic questions um and we
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
still haven't gotten into all the
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
details on the Diagnostics so thank
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
you just what could be a simple question
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
but in and I realize others are here to
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
testify and we will hear you um in your
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment in the amendment you propose
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
and also in the bill so it uses the word
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
and so these tests you know in in
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
section Roman 1 lowercase a a blood test
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound of vital
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
organs and a lung CT if indicated is
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
that right or should it say or so my
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
apologies for that I I guess my
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
presentation to you wasn't as clear as
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
we thought but that was just because we
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
removed and a skin cancer screening we
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
just had to add the word and in uh to
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
make it grammatically correct and that's
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
why it's in bold there well understood
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
but in the amendment proposed by
 
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative lki on line five and is
 
01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:31.470 align:start position:0%
representative lki on line five and is
still

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
there where it says and day long CT yes
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
yep that's accurate because um because
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
we had it and was not there prior it
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
said uh a an ultrasound of vital organs
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
comma a lung CTF indicated comma and a
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
cancer screening because we crossed out
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
and a cancer screen we just had to move
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
the and to the other part of the
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
sentence gotcha but my question is all
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
of these tests they're all required for
 
01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
the screening or can you just have a
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
blood test and not the ultrasound or the
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
lung CT so all members would be offered
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
all components of the test and they
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
could either get all of them or for me
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
for instance I just had my blood draw
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
and my ultrasound this morning uh I
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
would primarily be looking to just get
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the lung CT so they would be offered all
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
components of it they may not get all
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
components of
 
01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.269 align:start position:0%
components of
it

01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything further for
 
01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:36.589 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything further for
these

01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
individuals okay thank you both very
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
much anything further from you all right
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
thanks I know we have others um in
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
however order you'd like to come forward
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay if you could just state your name
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
my name is Christopher Wyman I'm a
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
lieutenant with the mar Mac New
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fire Department um and I'm
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
just here to talk briefly about one
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
aspect that you guys asked about was um
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
what's the impact on New Hampshire
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
firefighters um I'm a 32-year member of
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fire service I've been
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
a State Fire Marshal as well as a local
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
firefighter now serving in marac um my
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
wife at the same time was a 26- year
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire fire service
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
both a marac firefighter and retired as
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
a Nashville firefighter my wife uh
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
developed occupational lung cancer uh in
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
January of 2023 and in November of 2023
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
she passed away from that from that
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
occupational related cancer so
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
her diag tic team if that's what you
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
want to call it or her oncologists we
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
like to call them the Dream Team uh both
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
from Mass General and from Dana Farber
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh she had some amazing oncologists that
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
treated her through every step of her
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
process um even though when she was
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
originally diagnosed she was diagnosed
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
with and I'm always going to screw up
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
the name of it Andino carcinoma non-s
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
small lung cancer that was aggressive in
 
01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.110 align:start position:0%
small lung cancer that was aggressive in
nature

01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
um by the time she was diagnosed even
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
though as a firefighter she had annual
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
physicals being a member of the nashille
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
fire department being a firefighter or
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hazmat Tech and a member of the dive
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
team she had to go through annual
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
physicals annual pulmonary function
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
tests annual chest x-rays uh all all
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
those all those required physicals that
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
the fire department had to do even
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
though she went through all of those um
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
some of these diagnostic tests that we
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
talking about were not part of those
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
physicals um and unfortunately the
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
physicals never detected early on her
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
cancer uh so like I said by the time uh
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
she was diagnosed uh and we got through
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
all the testing that went through that
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosis she was diagnosed stage four
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
with mestic cancer to her bones uh she
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
did receive treatment she did receive
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy she did receive radiation
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
um but unfortunately the idea behind
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
those treatments were for prolonging
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
life not for curing uh and unfortunately
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
like I said 11 and a half months after
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis she she succumbed to that
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
disease and again the city of nashille
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the nashille fire department um
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
through the workers comp process
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
determined that her cancer was causally
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
related to her duties As A Firefighter
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
for the city of nsha so if you're
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
looking for its impact from New
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know that was asked I can
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
only speak to the one but for something
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
like this one one's too many at least in
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
my brain um if we can take and curve
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
this I know we can't cure it I know we
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
can't stop it but if we can take the
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
burden off the firefighters if we can
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
take the burden off the families um the
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
financial burden that goes along with it
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you you know I had good
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
medical insurance that covered my wife's
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
my wife's treatments uh but at the same
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
time there's a there's a financial
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
impact that goes that goes with all of
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
that between co-pays prescriptions you
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
know stuff that you know and I'm my
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
wife's been gone almost 6 months now and
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
I still get bills from the from Mass
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
General and from Dana Farber and all
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
that stuff that you know are parts that
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
insurance does not cover that I'm still
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with today so again just one
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
just one story of its of the impact of
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
cancer and firefighters like I said
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
being a member for 32 years I mean it's
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
a card that we deal in our hands um it's
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
hope it's one we hope we never see um
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
I've had friends Steve McKenna from
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
Salem Fire uh Mike Clark from Handover
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
fire uh and others that have surpassed
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
or have passed from cancer as being
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh so you know you always
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you see it you never hope it happens to
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
you or it lands to you close enough but
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
like I said unfortunately it does happen
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire New Hampshire's not um
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
avoidance of it so thank you well thank
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and I'm very
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
sorry to hear about the loss of your
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
wife I feel that I speak on behalf of
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
the entire community of miramac as well
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
as division 3 so know that um that means
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
a lot to us what she gave and what you
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
have undergone as a supporting spouse
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mo any
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions for a officer or firefighter
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
next okay nobody else to speak on Senate
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 35
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
two all
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
right okay so we have uh multiple
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
amendments to and it looks like a third
 
01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:04.229 align:start position:0%
amendments to and it looks like a third
one

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
coming uh to
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
consider uh with a vote on Friday so um
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
I would say we we think about that
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has any further Thoughts
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
with regards to these amendments and um
 
01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
with regards to these amendments and um
we

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
can move to the next bill but that was
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of helpful and
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:39.870 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
okay we move then to Senate Bill
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
355 that's an act relative to newborn
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
screening for cylo virus otherwise known
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm looking
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
at is dated March 5th is that the most
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
recent I believe you have one that I
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
handed out separately that's dated today
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
although the fiscal impact is the same
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
there isn't one um although I will note
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
that in conversations with the
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
department they believe they'll need 20%
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
of a full-time equivalent position to
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
carry out the terms of this bill uh
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
however our stance as an office is that
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
if a new position isn't actually going
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
to be filled we treat that as a no
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and I think the
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
unlikelihood of filling a position for
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
20% of the time is such that this is
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
essentially a no fiscal impact
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill so a no fiscal impact Bill thank
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
you for that Mr
 
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.830 align:start position:0%
you for that Mr
Ripple

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
um on Senate Bill
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
355 and you'll notice to reflect that it
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
is not on the appropriation
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
bills list that we received today is a
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
triple confirmation of no fiscal impact
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
anyone here to discuss Senate Bill 355
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
point if you could just introduce
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
yourselves naturally make sure your
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
microphones are fully on that would be
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you for being
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%

Services good morning I'm Courtney Keane
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
I'm with public health and I have direct
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
oversight of the newborn hearings
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
program thank you both thanks uh thank
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
you for allowing us to um provide some
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
comments on the bill I just wanted to
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
share that the bill as just a little
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
history if I could as the bill that was
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate had a lot of
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
technical defects um the intent of the
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor was to um have some newborn
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
screening coverage for cytomegalo virus
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
which I can get Courtney is really the
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
expert in that but I can give you some
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
information that it's one of the most
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
common infectious causes of birth
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
defects in the United States with about
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
one and 200 babies born with congenital
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
CMV it's um congenital CMV is passed
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
from Mom to baby um one out of five
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
babies with congenital CMV have symptoms
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
of long-term health problems such as
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
hearing loss um and that can progress
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
from mild to severe during the first two
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
years of life which is a critical part
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh area for learn language learning so I
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
think the intent of the sponsor was to
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
have some awareness around CMV for
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
newborn screening um and I can let
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
Courtney fill you in on that process but
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
originally in the bill it would have put
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh the screen for CMV under the newborn
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
screening program which is under RSA
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
13210 Dasa so CMV is not recommended at
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
the federal level yet for it to be
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
included in uh the Rus which was the
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
recommended uniform screening panel Rec
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
recommended by Hera so the state program
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh when there is a federal
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation then we'll consider those
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
for adoption to the state program and
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
that is currently not recommended uh we
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
worked with Senator inis to try to um
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
address some of the technical issues in
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced and came up with
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
a what we thought was a great compromise
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
for the Department to help with
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
awareness for Education around CMV
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
through the newborn screening program
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
yet not adopting it officially um and
 
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
also reporting on some screenings that
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
are being done uh voluntarily by a few
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals um after a baby
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
has failed a couple of screening uh
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
newborn screening hearing tests uh and
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
we would include that information in uh
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
a report to HHS over site that amended
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
version of the bill came to the house
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
and we had estimated uh the department
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
after completing a fiscal note um had
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
there was no fiscal impact to the
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
department for the version that passed
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
um through the Senate and came to the
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
policy committee so what the bill as you
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
see it now was amended on the floor um
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
to add uh the um requirement that the
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
department would um amend its rule to
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
require um individuals um conducting
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
newborn hearings screeing and diagnostic
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
hearing evaluations um in hospitals uh
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
or or other facilities to report uh to
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the department if the final hearing
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
screening um was not a pass and if if
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
there was a CMV test so that's kind of
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
level set where we are with the bill now
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
so as Mr Ripple indicated um the
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
department uh looked at our um what this
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
might cost to to us and realized that
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
there would be maybe a point2 FD
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
required which we estimated to be about
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
26,000 a year annually um to carry out
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the bill as passed on
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
the floor and Courtney can weigh in on
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
anything she'd like to contribute as
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
well um the point to FTE which is based
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um is there to help
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
with amending the rules which is the
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
collection of CM CMV results for those
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
infants who did not pass their second
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
hearing screening at the hospital
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
provide hospital and provider education
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
on CMV testing um
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh the newborn hearing screening
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
program data system has the capacity to
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
collect CMV however Education and
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
Training will need to be provided to the
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals and staff for timely and
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
accurate data
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
collection um the position will also be
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for reporting so the
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and then without the
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
funding the department does not have the
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
adequate Staffing capacity to make these
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
new um recommendations based on the
 
01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:25.590 align:start position:0%
new um recommendations based on the
amendment

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
so a bill to amend a
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
rule yeah okay uh anyone have any
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
these two
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
witnesses representative Leon um thank
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you both for
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
working with me through this whole
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
process um as adopted on the floor it
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't have the um it doesn't
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
specifically call out the education and
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
the reporting to oversight but you see
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
that as a direct function of putting
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
this in to rules that those would
 
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.709 align:start position:0%
this in to rules that those would
naturally

01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
flow okay that's a yes yes sorry yeah so
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
part of the education providers they
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
need to know how to test so we're just
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
there to provide the support to the
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals on what the best Protocols are
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and if I could add in
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
working with Senator inis on um the
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed the Senate he well
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
the intent was to really have some um
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
education um and under the new the
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
newborn screening hearing program um
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
maybe Courtney could talk about Eddie a
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
little bit and and what they do and and
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
how they were planning to look at this
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
more specifically and kind of flush out
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
some of the spe spe specifics before
 
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we got to um requiring um
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals to report to the department
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently there are four
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals that have adopted on their own
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
to screen for CMV after the infant does
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
not pass its second hearing screening
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
these hospitals do it through urine or
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
saliva which is the be best method for
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the other hospitals as a standard of
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
care screen all infants for hearing loss
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and if referred they're supposed to go
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
to an audiologist with their box of risk
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
factors right so if a baby is screened
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
at a hospital they would have and had a
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
CMV test it would be sent to an
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
audiologist with they were screened for
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
CMV because it's a different protocol
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe there's someone here that
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
can speak better um than I can on that
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but that is the process right now for
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
babies who have a hearing screening for
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
those hospitals that do this screening
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
they follow up with a CMV test those
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
other hospitals do a hearing screening
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
and then send to audiologists for
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic testing and forther
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
infant representative Lon followed by
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative walner um thank you do
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
you know if the time it takes to see an
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
audiologist is within the diagnostic
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
window for congenital CMV
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
infections so you're supposed to screen
 
01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
an infant for CMV within the first 21
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
days of life to to determine if it's
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
congenital infants in New Hampshire are
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
seen by a diagnostic or an audiologist
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
around six months of
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
age thank you that's very helpful
 
01:21:10.679 --> 01:21:12.550 align:start position:0%
age thank you that's very helpful
representative

01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
walner thank you could you go over again
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the Staffing what was did I hear that
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
it was 0.2 yep so 20 % of a
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
staff and what was the cost of that
 
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.550 align:start position:0%
staff and what was the cost of that
26,000

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
annually for 20% of of a staff
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
person could I
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
ask follow up how would you go about
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
would you actually hire someone
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
for 20% of a full-time position or would
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
you wrap this in into another position
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
that you already have and if so how is
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
that position funded so I would wrap
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
this into a position that is already um
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
that we already have so we get funding
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
from the CDC and hersa for hearing
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
screening um so I would leverage that
 
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
position to help with the CMV education
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
data follow up so if if you already have
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
the position and you already have the
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
funding there would be no need for an
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation at this point I apologize
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
I would post a position it is so we have
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
funding and I would allocate funds
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
through the grant that we have to help
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
so this would be a combined point so it
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
would be half of a position a part-time
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
position to do this work within the
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
hearing screening program so it would
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you both very
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
much I try to give a little summary of
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the Bill's background so this bill came
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
out of Senate Health and Human Services
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
5 to nothing uh then the full Senate by
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote went to house Health and
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
Human Services and came out 10 to 10
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
without a recommendation but after a
 
01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.709 align:start position:0%
without a recommendation but after a
floor

01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I see was uh sponsored
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
by representative Lon it then came out
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the Full House ought to pass with
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
priest thank you madam chairman I just
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
have a question a clarification question
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
for one of you please Courtney if you
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
could join us again
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned that you would be
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
needing uh a staff member that this bill
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
would cause you to have 20% of a staff
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
person's time and then I heard 50% staff
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm not clear on what's going on
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
so my goal would be to so create a
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
part-time position use 20% of this
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
funding and match it with 30% of my CDC
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
you okay yes absolutely step right up
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
and make sure your microphone is on
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
please in your
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
name thank you madam chair my name is
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
Ben Bradley I'm the vice president of
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
state government relations for the New
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
Association um I appreciate the
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony or commentary from the
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill um we too supported uh the bill
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Senate with the
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
language that was proposed there working
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
with Senator inis uh our members do have
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about the direction this bill
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
has gone uh since the floor amendment in
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
the house with uh mandating a CMV
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
screening after a failed hearing test um
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
particularly because the medical
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
literature uh does not support that
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation um
 
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
recommendation um
and

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
um uh the recommendation for automatic
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
hearings excuse me automatic CMV
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
screening after a failed hearing
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics um is
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
what we would reference and they too do
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
not um share the suggested mandate for a
 
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.149 align:start position:0%
not um share the suggested mandate for a
CMV

01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
CMV
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
screening um if I might say we do feel
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
that this is a really important issue um
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
it does affect a number of newborns uh
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
many of our hospitals as pointed out
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
well I would say um as referenced by the
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
department four of our hospitals um
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
members do screen for CMV um and use
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
their medical judgment as to when to
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that um after a failed hearing
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
screening others do not um have that
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
policy um but I think this is evolving
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
and our members continue to continually
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the issue um and want to make
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
sure that newborns are treated early and
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
and um this can be tracked um for their
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
treatment uh as appropriate but under
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
the current makeup of of the bill as
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
amended by the floor on the floor um
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
where where we do have some concerns
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
Mandate thank you so exactly uh what is
 
01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
the harm I guess in
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
requiring such a result for an infant
 
01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
who does not pass the final newborn
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
hearing screening uh if you seems if you
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
take a test and you get a answer why not
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
I guess uh the necessity of it I mean
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
this bill mandates it uh mandates the
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
report of the result um so effectively
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
mandating the screening um the necessity
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
of of doing that for newborns um some of
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
the reading I've done just in you know
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
preparation uh demonstrates that um in
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
certain trials uh there were CMV screens
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
that did take place and um uh not all
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
were um flagged as positive but there
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
may have been more newborns uh as as
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
positive um you know later in their uh
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
early life so the effectiveness of the
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
test in in finding um
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
positive CMV but again I i' just like to
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate Our Testimony is that we have
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about the Mandate particularly
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
given the medical literature doesn't
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
support that uh um mandate after a
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
failed hearing
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
screening happy to work with anybody
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
though represent Leen uh thank you madam
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much Mr Bradley
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
for being here sorry that I've been so
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
busy and haven't followed up with you as
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
much as I would like um so I guess my
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
first question is you were talking about
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
the potential false negative rate of the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
test um but congenital CMV can only be
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
cond is detected in those first 21 days
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
and CMV is a commonly acquired infection
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
through things like saliva which happen
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
in child care and I'm not sure if you
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
can send me whatever study that shows
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
that perhaps there's some issues with
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
that test you know you know I'm a data
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
person I'd appreciate that and um then
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
my other is um I'm trying to understand
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
the disconnect too that if this needs to
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
be screened within 21 days for A
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
congenital screening um how do we how do
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
we square that with the average
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
six-month follow-up with the audiologist
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
after the failed when we know that there
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
are treatments so a positive diagnosis
 
01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:55.719 align:start position:0%
could have a change in the clinical
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
treatment for these children um should
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
they have that positive diagnosis at
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
Birth so just a clarifying question on
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
my part um you're asking about the
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
timeline between when a newborn is born
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the appointment with an audiologist
 
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
and how we Square the CMV
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
screening um within the 21 days when the
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
audiologist may be seen within six
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
months is that so I think the
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
audiologist would focus on the hearing
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
screening um the CMV test is my
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is not a treatment that
 
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
the audiologist would reflect on um but
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not a medical provider I could
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
certainly go back and look at that so
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
there may be just a there may just be a
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
disconnect in the treatment the the
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
audiologist is going to treat the
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
hearing whereas another provider may
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
help support the treatment for CMV that
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for that very
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
much appreciated the
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
355 yes ma'am if you could just again
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
state your
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
name and just make sure your microphone
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
is to the on in fact if you use the
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
on okay I slide right over
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
here good morning um Mam chairwoman and
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Carolyn Drury and that's
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
Carolyn with YN and d y I'm from
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
nashwa I am a retired audiologist but
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
serve as the current president of the
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Academy of
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
Audiology I'm here representing the
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
academy and in spite of all the various
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
iterations of this bill we are still
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
here standing in support of having a CMV
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
screening to address some of the other
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
issues that have been brought up um we
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
are disappointed that the general
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
education aspect of this was not
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
included in the floor Amendment um
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
because that's that's a key an excuse me
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
a a good piece that helps again with any
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
virus the more you know the mother women
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
of childbearing age know about the fact
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
that this virus virus exists and that it
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
they can take as with any other virus
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
some general Common Sense uh precautions
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
just to prevent them just to keep the
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
spread of the virus down if if they're
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
aware of it um as far as support both
 
01:31:41.199 --> 01:31:42.790 align:start position:0%
aware of it um as far as support both
the

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
American the American speech language
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
hearing Association and the Academy of
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Audiology both
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
recommend CMV screenings
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
on that basis um as far as the
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
audiologist not being able to see the
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
child till 6 months later that's here in
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um again I live in nsha a
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
number of people there choose to go down
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
to Boston Children's either in Boston or
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
Lexington um the baby actually can be
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
tested younger than that it's just a
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
backup um I think that unless there are
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions I think that's all I'll say
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much could you uh or
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
do you recall if you don't have it in
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
front of you what in the Senate version
 
01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.030 align:start position:0%
front of you what in the Senate version
regarding

01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
education you are missing from this bill
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
specifically you uh referred to that
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
general education piece what specific it
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
was more of an education piece whereby
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
um through the newborn screening task
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
force they would generate a brochure
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
that would go out to
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
um doctors nurs
 
01:33:00.109 --> 01:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
midwives um obsti gynecologists and so
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
forth um possibly Public Health Centers
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know and just sort of start just
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
family practitioners just try to get the
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
word out that this is a a very common
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
virus according to CDC studies um only
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
one in 10 of women of childbearing age
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
have ever actually heard of it and if we
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
can increase the numbers on that we feel
 
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
would be important from a just to try to
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the spread of the virus as
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
possible as a preventative measure thank
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
you I've noticed you did not touch upon
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
the Mandate who the previous speaker uh
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
spoke of and perhaps you did that
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
intentionally just wondering if you have
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
an opinion on that piece um not
 
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
specifically I I don't mind have
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
personally having a a mandate on that
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
but I do recognize um that with any kind
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
of mandate there should be at least an
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
option for a parent if they so choose to
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
be able to wave
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you any further comments
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
questions represent Leon uh thank you
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for being here for
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
this um I I'm not sure if you heard the
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
testimony from the department but it
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
sounds like there already would there
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of Education that would
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
flow from these R making so the fact
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
that I accidentally left that out of my
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
floor AB bed hopefully isn't a problem
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay it does look like the bill has you
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
know naturally dramatically changed from
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
when it was first introduced obviously
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
people are working on it so uh there's
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
that to consider anything further thank
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
you very much for coming thank you for
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
your time and attention all right anyone
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
else here to comment on Senate Bill
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
355 yes representative walner I do have
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
one more question of the
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
up so you referred to I believe it was
 
01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.870 align:start position:0%
up so you referred to I believe it was
hersa

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
hersa
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
you yes the newborn hearing screening
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
program is funded by CDC and Hera
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
however that funding is allocated for
 
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
however that funding is allocated for
other

01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
activities not CMV screening so I would
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
use in future budgets a portion of that
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
funding so it would be that funding
 
01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:36.870 align:start position:0%
funding so it would be that funding
would

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
this project this proposal could be
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
funded through the hersa
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
funding you need an additional I would
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
need additional funding to support the
 
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.709 align:start position:0%
need additional funding to support the
position

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that because uh
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
the CDC funds and the Hera funds are are
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
restricted to certain activities that if
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
this would be a new a new activity um to
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
screen for CMV and would need funding in
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
in however that framework worked with a
 
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
0 five or 20% of a05 to be able to
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the bill would ask the
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
department to do so this is not a um
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
function that the CDC funding or there's
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
a funding right now would allow you to
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
fund to correct correct So currently
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is not an
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
activity part as part of those
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
you okay uh for discussion purposes I
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
think we'll have an amendment drafted um
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
to include the general education piece
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was taken
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
out as well as the opt out
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
option I'm hoping there's still no
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact as a result of
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple is that an amendment you
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
could put in yes I can do that okay
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay anything further from those in the
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
audience all right we are ready then to
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 404 is entitled an act
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
relative to expanding Child Care
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
Professionals eligibility for the child
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program as means of
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
some background again with the
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that the full background can
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
be found on the docket at nh.gov
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
this bill got through the Senate Health
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee 5 to0 it
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
was amended it came out of Senate
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
Finance 6 to0 the amendment however
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
passed 13 to 11 in the
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
Senate however in the end it came out of
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate on a Voice
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
vote it went to the house committee on
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
child care of which it came out 10 to
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
zero and then out of the Full House on a
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
Voice vote ought to pass with
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is the general background on
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill excuse me Senate Bill
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
404 let's go to the fiscal note it looks
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
like we do have an updated version dated
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
that so it came out of the Senate with
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
no fiscal
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
impact it came out of the
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
house I might add on the consent
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
calendar with a price tag of over $2
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
million starting in 2025 and going
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
through 20126 each year thereafter in
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
2027 any comments Mr Ripple on a fiscal
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
note no other than that the final Senate
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
version was a reporting requirement only
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
for HHS and they were tasked with uh
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
estimating the cost of the program for
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
future budgets whereas the version
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
amended by the house would establish the
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right anyone um here today to
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
404 and Sir if you could introduce
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
yourself naturally and make sure your
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
position thank you uh Brian Clark I'm
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the uh division of
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
economic stability part of the
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
Services welcome thank you so what this
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
bill would do is there's currently
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
existing Child Care Program called the
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Child Care scholarship
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
program and what it does is it provides
 
01:40:14.109 --> 01:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
a Child Care Subsidy uh for qualifying
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
low-income people who knew child care
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
and participate in quality qualifying
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
activities such as
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
employment and so what this bill does is
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
create another Child Care Program for um
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
child care
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
workers and it as a prerequisite it
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
would require the um child care worker
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
to apply for the ordinary Child Care
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship and we expect largely most
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
child care workers will be eligible for
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the child care scholarship and
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
receive um the subsidy that way and for
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
um childcare workers whose incomes are
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
just a little too high to qualify for
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
the regular New Hampshire Child Care
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship it would provide a subsidy
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
them thank you you're familiar with the
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
Senate version I
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
assume uh yes I'm familiar with the um
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senate version all Senate versions do
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
you the one that came over to the house
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
that was a reporting requirement
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
essentially yeah it was essentially um
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
asking the department to take a look at
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
the concept um and propose it in its
 
01:41:35.639 --> 01:41:41.910 align:start position:0%
the concept um and propose it in its
next

01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
budget is there any
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
similar program in other areas of law to
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
this so it's what it's extremely similar
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
to is the New Hampshire Child Care
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship program or are you asking
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
about in the way it operates and that it
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
provides a child a subsidy to Providers
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
to provide child care um the
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
latter what you said the specifics of
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
providing Child Care oh okay so the
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
specifics of um providing Child Care So
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
currently we have a child care
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
um if a um if a parent is eligible and
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
they apply um at a district officer
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
online they can enroll their kids in
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
child care and then um the they um
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the parents income they
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
could be responsible for a cost
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
share um that they have to pay to the
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
provider and then the department would
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
pay the rest through the New Hampshire
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
Child Care scholarship program so this
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
new program would operate in a similar
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
way in that um the parent would be
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for a cost share of 7% of
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
their household income and then the
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
state would pay the provider for the
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
rest thank you for that any
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
hold thank you madam chair um maybe I
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question um relative
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
to how you asked the last question are
 
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
you asking are there any other
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
disciplines or departments that get a
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
similar credit cuz that's how I took
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
your question and I was going to ask
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
that right is this available is
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
something similar available to I don't
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
know the police firefighters teachers
 
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.430 align:start position:0%
know the police firefighters teachers
any

01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
other not to my
 
01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge Pur of whole thank you um
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
second question is there any strong
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
reason why this has to be done in an
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
off-budget year given the almost $3
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
million for the first
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
year so um I would um it's not a
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
department sponsored legislation I
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
would um we're generally supportive of
 
01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.229 align:start position:0%
would um we're generally supportive of
the

01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
concept um however we're
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
not I'm not really prepared to argue for
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.719 --> 01:44:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
priest uh thank you Madame chairman uh
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
sir do you have the approximate salary
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
range for the average child care workers
 
01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it was in
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
so it appears I don't have it on hand
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
but I believe it it was around1 to13 an
 
01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:44.030 align:start position:0%
but I believe it it was around1 to13 an
hour

01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay so that's considerably lower than
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
just the
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
living yes that we need to live in New
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes so um as I said there's an
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
existing uh New Hampshire Child Care
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and individuals with
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh household
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
incomes uh up to 85% of the state median
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
income qualify for it and can receive uh
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
a Child Care Subsidy that way uh this is
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
generally targeted at workers who uh
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
might have Partners or spouses who are
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
slightly higher income who bring them a
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
little over that threshold and so
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's no real incentive for the worker
 
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to work if their uh entire
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
wage would go to uh paying for child
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
care so this would cover uh the cost of
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
that for
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
them okay represent as a followup with
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
that and again the child care workers
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
salaries are considerably lower than
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
other public service employees like fire
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
and police and and Municipal wouldn't
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
you say without having the numbers in
 
01:47:02.109 --> 01:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
front of you yeah I don't have the exact
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
numbers but I would I I would reckon
 
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably true thank you
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative tarki followed by
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative leyon thank you madam
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just curious if you have any
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
idea of um this is obviously a Workforce
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
kind of Bill it would have a huge impact
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
I believe do you have any idea of the
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
vacancies in Workforce for the childcare
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
industry or um how many spots are needed
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to get at is
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a potential benefit to
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
bring on childcare Workforce and I know
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a huge demand for child
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
care spots in the
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
state yeah I do not have information on
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
the vacancy in the classrooms uh but I
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
can get that for you well I guess I'm
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
looking vacancy in Workforce like how
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
many workers does the industry need okay
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
I as I yeah same same answer I don't
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
have that information from me but I can
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
get it for you great thank you
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you madam
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here um I
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
do know that at least some Child Care
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
Centers offer free child care to
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
employees as a benefit of working um
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
what impact would this legislation in
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
this program have on that
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
practice uh so likely those child care
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
workers or those child care providers
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
would choose uh either to continue and
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
then ask their um workers to enroll in
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
this program and then the free program
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
would just cover the cost share the
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
family cost share to continue providing
 
01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.709 align:start position:0%
family cost share to continue providing
that

01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
benefit um or they would decide to
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
um I I can't speak to what a provider
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
would decide to do in that
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
situation thank you okay representative
 
01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
hle sure um no real expertise in this
 
01:48:52.119 --> 01:48:53.350 align:start position:0%
hle sure um no real expertise in this
domain

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
domain
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in statute that
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
limits or caps the current rate relative
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
to child care I know it's expensive I
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
just wasn't sure whether you're aware of
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
limitations on rate
 
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
setting um so there are rules Federal
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
rules around how we um determine what
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
our rates are we conduct a rate study um
 
01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
and then base our the rate that the
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship pays based on
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
that and I can certainly provide more
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
detail um in a followup okay thank
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
you okay all set thank you very much and
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm realizing you're the only one to
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill and you're sort of
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
bearing the burden of uh sponsors and
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
information source and everything else
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate your ability to feel
 
01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
these questions and and do all that
 
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
you okay uh now I'm realizing my version
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 404 had all the complete
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
Pages included I am realizing now some
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
of your versions did not so I hope
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
everybody at this point realizes there
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
is a first page
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
and and we're all on the same page with
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill okay I didn't
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
realize that again because my version
 
01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:15.870 align:start position:0%
realize that again because my version
was

01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
complete okay this bill has
 
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
undergone some serious changes since its
 
01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.830 align:start position:0%
undergone some serious changes since its
initial

01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
introduction um there's no one here from
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
the special Committee of child care come
 
01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
the special Committee of child care come
forward

01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay and do be sure to introduce
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
yourselves thank you very much Madam
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
chair um my name is Michelle Merritt I'm
 
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
the president at new Futures and with me
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
is my colleague hi my name is Rebecca
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
lovsky and I'm the child and family
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
policy director at new futures um new
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
Futures worked with a coalition of
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and child care providers um
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
over the last 18 months and this piece
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation was born from some of
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
those conversations there were questions
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
that were asked earlier um that we may
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
have some answers to so we thought we
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
would share them with you um presently
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
in child care in New Hampshire right now
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's a vacancy rate of about
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
26% um the reason why this particular
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation was put forward was
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
because of a um there was some
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
interesting work done out of Kentucky
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
and some other states that piloted um
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
addressing Child Care shortages through
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
Child Care scholarship for the workers
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
during Co the covid-19 pandemic um and
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
they saw with that experience a
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
significant difference in the retention
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
and their success and keeping folks in
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
the workplace as a result of offering
 
01:51:39.719 --> 01:51:40.550 align:start position:0%
the workplace as a result of offering
this

01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
benefit um just for some general
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
awareness um the data available on Early
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
Childhood Workforce um in New Hampshire
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
specifically the largest share of
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
workers are between the ages of 20 to 24
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at the next age
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
bracket 25 to 30 you see that about half
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
of those workers have left the workforce
 
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
by the time they reach that particular
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
age bracket the anecdotal experience
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from Child Care
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
Providers is that a they're primarily
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
women um more than 95% of childcare
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
workers are women and the reasons why
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
they're leaving is because in many cases
 
01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
they're having children um and they're
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
finding that they cannot afford the cost
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
of child care to remain in the workforce
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
so the average child care worker in New
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they are working full-time
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
salaried um makes around 31 to $32,000 a
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
year if you have two kids though the
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
average cost of care is about 27 to
 
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
$28,000 um so economically for those
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
families the choice for the the in many
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
cases if it's a two- parent household
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
the woman to stay home uh makes more
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
sense than continuing to work but we
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
also need these folks in the workforce
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
because the weights for child care and
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
the accessibility challenges that we're
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
having in New Hampshire right now are
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
significant so that is some of the
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
background information on the vacancy
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
rate the reason why this is a targeted
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to address a unique
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
problem that's specific to this
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce um issue and some of the
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
financial pieces around how much it
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
costs to have your kids in care and what
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
the average wage
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
is I don't know if there's anything that
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
you want to add um the other thing that
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just add is um to note that the
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
special committee on Child Care did add
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
a provision within this bill that would
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
require DHHS to attempt to get a waiver
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
to use federal funds for this program
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
and other states have been successful in
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
that as this is a practice that the
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal government through ccdf is
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
supportive of for all the reasons that
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
Michelle outlined and the importance of
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of our
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce for our overall
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of um New
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
R Leon um thank you madam chair and
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for bringing this
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
information this this actually brings up
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
a question to me too it almost seems
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
like um if these women are leaving to
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
watch their two children um they if they
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
had an home with up to three children in
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
their home where it's more like a family
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
type uh situation which are the UN the
 
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
ones that don't require licensing she
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
may actually be making more by providing
 
01:54:21.629 --> 01:54:21.639 align:start position:0%
care to three kids in her neighborhood
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to hers as opposed to
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
working in a child care center I don't
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
know if you've looked at that with the
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
empowerment and the impacts on the
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
family so I can just speak to the fact
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
that childcare scholarship is utilized
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
by center-based and atome families so
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is feasible for an
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
individual who lives in a single family
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
home to open up that home to take in
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
kids and we thoroughly encourage that
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that's not possible you
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
may have heard Bill's a session around
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
zoning limitations and um just the
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
financial inability to start their own
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
inhome child care we have um been
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill because it comes
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
from the field from teachers from
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
directors from staff who wish that they
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
could be in the room teaching but they
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
simply cannot do it because they cannot
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
absorb the cost so again that is a
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
possibility and we fully support family-
 
01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
based child care this child care
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship does but the reality is that
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
not every family has that opportunity
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
not every individual does yeah there's
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
not a single Silver Bullet solution to
 
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
this challenge it really is a
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
multi-prong multifaceted issue um so I
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to also
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
look at and support those simultaneously
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
moving pieces of legislation that have
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
care any further comments or questions
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you both very much anyone
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
else to uh comment on Senate Bill
 
01:55:45.159 --> 01:55:47.229 align:start position:0%
else to uh comment on Senate Bill
404

01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
404
 
01:55:47.239 --> 01:55:49.030 align:start position:0%
404
okay

01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
um thoughts from the committee
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
my thought is Mr Ripple that we um have
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
drafted uh to replace the bill with the
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
last Senate
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
version with no fiscal impact
 
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
essentially a duplicate of that um
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
however the the previous two
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
speakers You' mentioned something at the
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
end of your comment with regards to
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
something also that needed to be studied
 
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
you just um made a remark about that and
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if perhaps that and I want
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
to get it specific should also be
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
amendment um so the last reference was
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
to another bill that is already moving
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
um related to some zoning issues that
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
exist um we have comment obviously and
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
can work with the committee around
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
different iterations and drafts um for
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
this bill to contain costs my colleague
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
ALS also mentioned opport unities to
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
pursue Federal waivers um our
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
organization's concern was if you went
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
back to the the Senate version as it
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
came out of Senate finance that you
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
would lose some critical pieces and
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities to move forward and seek
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
some of those waivers now um so we'd
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to work with the
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
advocacy community and others around um
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
potential amendments and we personally
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
do not support the Senate version
 
01:57:17.709 --> 01:57:17.719 align:start position:0%
understood thank you okay then thank you
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
clarification so that Amendment for
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes on Friday would be
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
an exact duplicate of the Senate version
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
nothing else to be added based on what
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
you said okay represent walner I am
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to um work with uh new Futures and
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
other organizations to come up with an
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think we could uh use
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
to push this bill for further um I know
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
because I'm on the uh Child Care special
 
01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee we heard from a number of
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
providers and
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
um people wanting to be in the field and
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
also people who were providing care in
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
Center based or family child care
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
and this is a this is something they
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
could use as a recruitment tool and a
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
retention tool and this profession is
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
really having a hard time and because
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
they're having a hard time it means
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
other employers and other businesses in
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
our state are having a hard time because
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
they can't um attract
 
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
employees so I will bring forth an
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
amendment on Friday that will um look at
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
some of these pieces in a little bit
 
01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.830 align:start position:0%
some of these pieces in a little bit
different

01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
you anything further on cill
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
409 Senate Bill 409 is an act relative
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
to reimbursement for ambulance services
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
under the State Medicaid
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
plan now pause for just a moment would
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
objection if I also take up Senate Bill
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
455 at the same time for the purposes of
 
01:59:31.229 --> 01:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
this work session which is an act
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
relative to Medicaid reimbursement rates
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
devices representative walner we have no
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
objection but we do the bill that we
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
have before us the the printed copies
 
01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
also look like they are missing pages
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
same with the same with 417 so okay
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me know because my
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
copies I got them early do not have that
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%

good
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
um at this point why don't we take a
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
five minute break five minutes and we'll
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
get the pation figured out thank
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%

02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
complete now um sorry about
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that but um I I think at this point
 
02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
we'll take up Senate bills
 
02:06:27.239 --> 02:06:28.830 align:start position:0%
we'll take up Senate bills
409

02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
409
 
02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:31.790 align:start position:0%
409
and

02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
455 together seeing as though they
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
are Loosely
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
related so is anyone here to discuss
 
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
either Senate Bill 409 or Senate Bill
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
4555 and if you could come forward and
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
identify yourself and which of the two
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
or both you're here to discuss thank
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
you I Rob Barry general counsel of the
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid with New Hampshire
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS I'm here to speak about both bills
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
just briefly uh we supported the policy
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
throughout um the the process thus far
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
um as far as uh sp sp 409 does not have
 
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
an appropriation attached to the bill
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
which we feels pretty critical for us to
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
be able to implement uh although we uh
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
support the policy we don't think we can
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
Implement without a uh an appropriation
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions you
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right um while you're here let
 
02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
me just briefly give a review of these
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
bills in terms of their background and
 
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so Senate Bill
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
409 that came from Senate Health and
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services 5 to0 Senate Finance 7
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
to0 came out of the Senate on a Voice
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
vote came out of Health and Human
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
Services on the house side
 
02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
18-2 and was adopted by the house on a
 
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
Voice vote on the consent calendar the
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on Senate Bill
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
be you have an updated version but it's
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same as the previous version okay an
 
02:08:23.310 --> 02:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh correct okay and looks like a million
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds and a million
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
of federal funds in each of the years
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
2027 now why is it Mr Ripple that that
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
does not appear on the appropriation
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
bills chart it doesn't contain an
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation it has a cost but it's not
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
okay any thoughts on that all right and
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
you are saying on 409 that this is
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
insufficient now that we have that
 
02:09:02.589 --> 02:09:02.599 align:start position:0%
background the without an appropriation
 
02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's insufficient as I said the policy
 
02:09:06.430 --> 02:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
the department has supported uh from the
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
get-go and continues to support but um
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
we just cannot Implement without an
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation okay representative Leon
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
very much for being here um it it says
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner also submit an
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to the State Medicaid plan I'm
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
just curious how long that takes and how
 
02:09:25.229 --> 02:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
that impacts what the overall annual
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
cost of this would be so we anticipate
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
it take about 6 months to get a spa
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid plan uh submitted and
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
approved um as far as impact I I I
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
suppose if you go from July 1st to
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
January 1st then maybe you can slice
 
02:09:43.149 --> 02:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
that in half for next um next fiscal
 
02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
year but that's just an estimate off the
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
so is your
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion um essentially appropriation
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
language from Senate Bill
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
4555 and placing it into 409 or how do
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
you we do have some um appropriation
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
language we can offer the committee the
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
the 455 appropriation language um is a
 
02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
bit different than than this one uh
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
because I think it has it's a little bit
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
more open-ended I think um we did put
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
together some appropriation language
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
though for SP 409 um my computer died
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
while I was waiting back there so I
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't have with me but I can send it to
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
the committee um right uh right after
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
I'm done here and I get some power yeah
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful okay um any
 
02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful okay um any
thoughts

02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you very
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
much okay anyone else for either uh
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
Senate's bill Senate bills 409 or
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
455 all right let's move to the
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
that bill came out of Senate Health and
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
520 Senate Finance 6 to0 through the
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
full Senate on a Voice vote house Health
 
02:11:07.149 --> 02:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
and Human Services voted at
 
02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
17-3 and then the bill ultimately passed
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
in the house on a Voice
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
vote the fiscal
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
note let's go to that make sure do we
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
have an update doesn't look like it so
 
02:11:23.069 --> 02:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note most current is dated
 
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
March 19th that's right
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay to the tune of approximately
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
$620,000 per year starting in fiscal
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
year 25 from the general funds and
 
02:11:39.149 --> 02:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
$620,000 in federal
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.549 --> 02:11:54.559 align:start position:0%
um I wonder why
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
409 did not come with an
 
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation Clause how did that happen
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
does anyone know I don't know the
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
backstory to that you know um I I don't
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I don't know the
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
whole backstory on that but there
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
actually had been conflicting con
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
conditions in the drafting as it came to
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
health um house Health and Human
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
Services so I think that it was probably
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative hen
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
Phillips you're
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you I have some
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
um um background knowledge to your
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
question I spoke with Senator Apprentice
 
02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday about this um matter in
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
particular and she did mention to me
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it was an error that no one caught
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the Senate process um they are aware
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
of it now and are hoping that that could
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
be addressed um and it I think it was

03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
this is a work session of 10 bills
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
total for division three and five
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
Finance resuming from our lunch break
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:34.510 --> 03:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
yet yes okay excellent so reopening work
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
session division three in house finance
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
after lunch we're going to take up
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 417 at this point
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
that is an act relative to outof home
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
placements for
 
03:18:55.469 --> 03:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
children now interestingly enough I've
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
located a problem on the Bill's docket
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
on nh.gov and I've brought it to the
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
Senate's attention so it's a little uh
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
quirky there but in review this bill
 
03:19:09.229 --> 03:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
started in Senate
 
03:19:11.550 --> 03:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary with an a to pass with
 
03:19:15.389 --> 03:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment recommendation 5 to0 Senate
 
03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
Finance 7 to to Zer and then out of the
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
Senate on a Voice vote it then came to
 
03:19:23.550 --> 03:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
house children and family law with an 11
 
03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:25.150 align:start position:0%
house children and family law with an 11
to0

03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
to0
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation there was a house
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment proposed looks like it failed
 
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
175 to 188 there was a motion to table
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
that failed by four votes 180 to
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
184 and then the final house vote was
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.030 --> 03:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
174 all right let's move to the fiscal
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
note the most recent is dated May 3rd is
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
that correct yes it is all right
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:06.309 --> 03:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.590 --> 03:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
that oh really okay so Senate Bill
 
03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
4177 there's a uh miscopy situation here
 
03:20:17.389 --> 03:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
does everyone else have a complete
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.110 --> 03:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
what all right
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
mine I had mine with a paper
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
clip right there that other stack in
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
front no that one right there that's
 
03:20:32.760 --> 03:20:35.030 align:start position:0%
front no that one right there that's
yours

03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
yours
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:20:40.630 --> 03:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
great okay
 
03:20:44.550 --> 03:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so the fiscal note reads that as for
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS it looks like uh 1.2 million or
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
thereabouts in fiscal year
 
03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
2025 with a 1.7 in 2026 and a 1.8 in
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
2027 and then the judicial branch also
 
03:21:01.359 --> 03:21:03.469 align:start position:0%
2027 and then the judicial branch also
has

03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
um costs incurred there so for
 
03:21:08.950 --> 03:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures in fiscal year 2025 for
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
376,000 and that is consistent into
 
03:21:18.830 --> 03:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.830 --> 03:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
2027 okay any further thoughts on the
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right would anybody like to
 
03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
begin by um remarking on this Bill yes
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%

massio I am the associate child advocate
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
means I'm second in command to the child
 
03:22:01.189 --> 03:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
advocate Cassandra Sanchez who can't be
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
with us today she's out on the road
 
03:22:04.990 --> 03:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
traveling for work I'm also the attorney
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
for the office so I work primarily in
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
the legislative and policy field um I
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
just really want to give you all a
 
03:22:12.510 --> 03:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of background I know that you
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
all haven't had the pleasure of sitting
 
03:22:15.710 --> 03:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
through all the hearings in the Senate
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and in house and children and family law
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to just lay the
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
groundwork for this bill which we
 
03:22:23.429 --> 03:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
drafted with Senator Whitley and a
 
03:22:25.950 --> 03:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
number of sponsors as well as worked on
 
03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
with the children's oversight commission
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
that we present to monthly so each of
 
03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
the sections comes out of a different uh
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
situation or experience trends that we
 
03:22:37.950 --> 03:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
see at our office or other issues we
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
work through with the oversight
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
commission so I'll just run through the
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
sections really quickly and I'm happy to
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
take questions as we go through um as
 
03:22:49.830 --> 03:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
many of you know um from HB
 
03:22:52.349 --> 03:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
1573 which we had multiple hearings and
 
03:22:54.389 --> 03:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearings here a month or so
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
ago uh our office visited bledo Youth
 
03:23:00.790 --> 03:23:00.800 align:start position:0%

03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
institutional child abuse so both hb1
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
1573 as well as this SB 43 417 some
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
portions are based on that
 
03:23:17.229 --> 03:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
issue really having the place preference
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
to keep children out of residential
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
placement but also as close to home as
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
possible really reduces trauma for
 
03:23:26.269 --> 03:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
children who are already traumatized
 
03:23:27.910 --> 03:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's why they're in the system to
 
03:23:30.670 --> 03:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
begin with so section one here the
 
03:23:35.070 --> 03:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
presumption of imp State placement 169 C
 
03:23:36.910 --> 03:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
generally is the abuse and neglect
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
statute so this applies to children who
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
are in dcyf cases this is a pre-existing
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
section there were just some amendments
 
03:23:48.990 --> 03:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
to make it very clear that children
 
03:23:51.550 --> 03:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
should be placed outside of the state
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
only when there's a specialized need or
 
03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't exist within New
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as we all know New
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is still a small state we do
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
have um not as many residential
 
03:24:04.110 --> 03:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
placements not as much specialized
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
programming we're still working on
 
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
expanding our children's system of care
 
03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
so this is really just building the
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
preference to keep the child either
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire within New England
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
or in proximity to a place whether it's
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
a relative or kin because those people
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
could live outside the state and it may
 
03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
make sense to have a child in a
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
placement near that person so and it
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
really does just reiterate the um
 
03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
general knowledge that outof state
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
placements should also be limited in
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
time as well as require some increased
 
03:24:37.870 --> 03:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight do you want me to
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
stop and take questions each section or
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
power through um it looks like you do
 
03:24:44.349 --> 03:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
have a question now that way ask you
 
03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
want to us to hold questions or ask them
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
as you go Section by section you prefer
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
it's your committee whatever you prefer
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay real good uh representative h on
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
that qu you know section that you just
 
03:24:58.990 --> 03:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
referred to so as you go through right
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
you you brought up
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
1573 if there are overlaps
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
or um it conflicts with 1573 right as
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
you walk through each section please
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
note those differences for us and then
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
do you know why the change went from
 
03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
lease restrict restrictive to less
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
four it could be possible that there is
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
a relative or fictive kin placement that
 
03:25:31.710 --> 03:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
is outside the state so an instate
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
placement say in an Institutional
 
03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
setting would be more restrictive than
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
say grandma in
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so that's the difference
 
03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
the level of restrictiveness starts with
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
keeping a child in their family home
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
going to a Rel ative a fictive kin
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
placement a foster home in their
 
03:25:51.309 --> 03:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
Community foster home outside their
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
Community than institutional so that's
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
why that change in language just
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledges it could be that there's
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
someone out of state but that's still a
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
family like setting versus an instate
 
03:26:03.070 --> 03:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
institution represent of whole thank you
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the uh as a followup there should we
 
03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
try and clarify that sentence what you
 
03:26:10.349 --> 03:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
just said makes perfect sense to me but
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's not the way I would read this on
 
03:26:15.389 --> 03:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
its face value I think it's clarified
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
later in the bill when there's a very
 
03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:18.630 align:start position:0%
later in the bill when there's a very
clear

03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
clear
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
um description of from less least
 
03:26:26.590 --> 03:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive to most okay um and these
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
bills started as completely separate
 
03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
bills the overlap became when parts of
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
1573 got tacked onto the end of s417 in
 
03:26:38.790 --> 03:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate Judiciary Committee okay so
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning parts are completely
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
distinctive okay thank you um section
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
two uh regarding SI siblings Uh current
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
language is not so clear although it is
 
03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
in dcyf policy that siblings shall
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
remain together whenever possible it was
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
not clear in law this section as
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
currently written in law is really just
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
about sibling visits we have seen a
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
number of cases where dcyf separates
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
siblings sometimes out of necessity
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
early in a case but as they approach
 
03:27:13.630 --> 03:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
permanence the policy that children
 
03:27:15.309 --> 03:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
should be achieving permanence with
 
03:27:16.710 --> 03:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
their siblings and unless there's an
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
actual danger to the siblings was not
 
03:27:24.189 --> 03:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
always being followed and um there were
 
03:27:26.110 --> 03:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
several cases that the office of child
 
03:27:28.349 --> 03:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
advocate intervened in and felt that
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
this was important to clarify in law
 
03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that sibling primary relationship
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
is really important and that department
 
03:27:38.349 --> 03:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
shall place a child with their siblings
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
of course unless doing so would be a
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
safety concern which which does
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes occur and then this second
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
sentence does retain some of the
 
03:27:48.030 --> 03:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
original language that if they're not
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
placed together that there needs to be
 
03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts that there's
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
visitation between the siblings so that
 
03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
specific section again all of this
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
within 169 c um the third section here
 
03:28:04.990 --> 03:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
applies to hearings for parents within a
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
169 C case who were not charged
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
originally so that would be a case where
 
03:28:13.349 --> 03:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
say one parent had the children in their
 
03:28:15.670 --> 03:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
care children were removed from that
 
03:28:17.910 --> 03:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
parent there was Court proceedings the
 
03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
state charged that parent with abuse or
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
neglect the court made a finding so now
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
the child is in fact in state custody
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
the other parent who was not within that
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
home is a non-charged parent asking for
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
custody often um from my experience as a
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
DCF and as a parent attorney often that
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
parent was absent so they weren't
 
03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
immediately available at the beginning
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
of a case comes in wants placement of
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
their child the division does some
 
03:28:47.710 --> 03:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
investigation again some of this was in
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
policy but there was a Supreme Court
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
case called Bill F that was limiting the
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
information that the department was
 
03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
being able to gather as well as the
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
information available to the court now
 
03:28:59.670 --> 03:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
some a lot of this language came out of
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the harmony Montgomery case from the
 
03:29:04.750 --> 03:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
massachusett oca's recommendations of
 
03:29:06.189 --> 03:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
course we were all familiar with that
 
03:29:08.030 --> 03:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
trial um I believe Mr Montgomery is
 
03:29:11.110 --> 03:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
being sentenced this week so the
 
03:29:13.469 --> 03:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
language really just sort of tried to
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
build the framework over what um would
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that child's safety and a parent
 
03:29:22.349 --> 03:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
care who didn't hadn't been caring for
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
that child so and these are again
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
factors that the court May weigh these
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
are not mandatory um there's nothing
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's saying the court shall look at
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
every single box um some of these aren't
 
03:29:36.030 --> 03:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
going to be applicable to some parents
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
um but it is sort of laying out all of
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
the different factors that may impact
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
that child's safety and you know Harmony
 
03:29:47.389 --> 03:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
was a very public publicized case but we
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
see um many child deaths well in fact
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
our office reviews every child death but
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the last couple years there have been
 
03:29:54.750 --> 03:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
03:29:57.389 --> 03:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
high-profile um homicides of young
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
children by um a parent that had not
 
03:30:03.070 --> 03:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
previously had them in their custody um
 
03:30:06.030 --> 03:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
or another caregiver um when the state
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
is placing a child with anyone including
 
03:30:12.870 --> 03:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
a parent they then have the liability
 
03:30:14.189 --> 03:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're familiar there's
 
03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuits over Bon Harmony's mom is suing
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
the state um so this is a higher
 
03:30:22.830 --> 03:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
standard where the state has the child
 
03:30:25.189 --> 03:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
in their legal custody and is making a
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
placement that becomes State action and
 
03:30:28.910 --> 03:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
state liability if they're not able to
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
fully investigate um the safety of the
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
child with that parent and this would
 
03:30:36.429 --> 03:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
not apply to all cases as a dcyf
 
03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
attorney I can tell you often an outside
 
03:30:41.349 --> 03:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
parent would step in with you know
 
03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
contact they'd say okay you look safe
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
the case remains open because that other
 
03:30:47.229 --> 03:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
parent has ongoing abuse and neglect
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
case and they too have a right to have
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
that 12-month reunification time so very
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances under
 
03:30:58.349 --> 03:30:58.359 align:start position:0%
169c um section four are two new
 
03:31:01.229 --> 03:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
sections under 169
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
c19 19g revolves around placement
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
evaluations um we worked with um some of
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
the Specialists here in the state who
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
work on pediatric cases and
 
03:31:15.309 --> 03:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
evaluations this just makes it clear
 
03:31:18.110 --> 03:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the psych olical evaluation must be
 
03:31:20.790 --> 03:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
supervised or conducted by a licensed
 
03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist um with that specialized
 
03:31:24.750 --> 03:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
training unfortunately right now some of
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
the assessment um evaluations are not
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
being done by trained psychologists they
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
may be being done by a social worker
 
03:31:33.070 --> 03:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not even a master's level social
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
worker so that was a recommendation
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
brought To Us by um some specialized
 
03:31:40.830 --> 03:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
medical providers and um to your point
 
03:31:44.189 --> 03:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative hul this 169 c19 H
 
03:31:47.469 --> 03:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
this is new and this lays out that
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
presump the um prioritization I was
 
03:31:53.550 --> 03:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
talking about of what would be least
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
restrictive to most restrictive um the
 
03:31:59.229 --> 03:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
court must first find that the child
 
03:32:01.229 --> 03:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
can't remain in their home with their
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
biological family should that be the
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
case and again this is new language we
 
03:32:08.429 --> 03:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
do want to presume that remaining in the
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
family home is in that child's best
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
interest only if the court has made that
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
finding then you would determine
 
03:32:19.150 --> 03:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
the next placements you start with kin
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
or fictive kin um a couple of years ago
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
the definition of kin was expanded in
 
03:32:25.279 --> 03:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
the definition of kin was expanded in
170

03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
170
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
G25 to include relatives but also folks
 
03:32:32.349 --> 03:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
that are not related by blood and
 
03:32:34.469 --> 03:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
marriage but have a relationship with
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
the child or that child's family before
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
the placement takes place so that could
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
be you know someone that the child knows
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
their coach the teacher but especially
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
for young children someone you know five
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
and under doesn't have their own
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
relationships it could be Mom's college
 
03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
roommate uh you know a work friend who
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
is involved with the family knows the
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
parents well you wouldn't necessarily
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
say a 2-year-old has a substantial
 
03:33:01.349 --> 03:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
relationship but that was the language
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
that the this body chose to put into kin
 
03:33:07.710 --> 03:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago um so then
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
branching out from there if you don't
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
have any of those folks that are
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate or available or able you
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
look within the child's community of
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
origin you are trying to keep that child
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
connected with their Community with
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
their school with their friends with
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
their teachers and coaches um so that
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
may be with fictive kin that may be a
 
03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
licensed foster home preference going to
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
a licensed foster home that child
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
already had a relationship with if they
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
are either a known person or had been in
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
care then you keep expanding to a
 
03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
licensed foster home outside of that
 
03:33:40.189 --> 03:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
Community particularly if you're looking
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
for ISO care which is a more intensive
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic level of foster home un we
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of those in the state
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
currently um and then there's some
 
03:33:53.150 --> 03:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
language here around keeping the child
 
03:33:56.110 --> 03:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
in their school of origin again those
 
03:33:57.790 --> 03:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
connections for children are very
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
important to maintain um as they're
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
already in a traumatic situation having
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
suffered abuse or neglect being removed
 
03:34:08.269 --> 03:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
from their family and then finally only
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
if all of those placements are exhausted
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
you can't find any of those or they're
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
not appropriate then alternative
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
placements may be considered and this is
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
where you're starting to look at what we
 
03:34:21.070 --> 03:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
call institutional care which is a group
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
home or residential placement facility
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the language there around
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
how you're determining an appropriate
 
03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
placement for a
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
child um section five is a Amendment RSA
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
169 c23 regarding returning the child at
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
the at the end of a a dcyf case um so
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
again all of that we just talked about
 
03:34:47.790 --> 03:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
is under 169 C that applies only to
 
03:34:51.189 --> 03:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
children that are in a dcyf abuse and
 
03:34:51.199 --> 03:34:52.790 align:start position:0%
children that are in a dcyf abuse and
neglect

03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
case section six oh we do have a
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
question oh sure sure representative Lon
 
03:34:58.990 --> 03:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
for letting me bring a question at this
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
section I might be called away shortly
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
um my first question was around the
 
03:35:06.030 --> 03:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
definition of kin and then having
 
03:35:08.750 --> 03:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
fictive kin show up um we don't have a
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
definition of fictive kin anywhere in
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
the statutes and it seems that the
 
03:35:14.910 --> 03:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
intention is for that to be used the
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
same as we use the word kin um I'm
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if there's a
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
difference between kin and fictive kin
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
since fictive kin isn't defined anywhere
 
03:35:26.590 --> 03:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
so that's a term of art that it's used
 
03:35:28.510 --> 03:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
however it was this body that made that
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
decision two years ago in the 2022
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
session um when they expanded the
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
definition of kin that whatever
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
reasoning this body ey wasn't in this
 
03:35:42.030 --> 03:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
position then chose not to change the
 
03:35:45.189 --> 03:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
wording they kept it kin but expanded
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
that definition to include what we now
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
colloquially refer to as fictive kin and
 
03:35:53.710 --> 03:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
that may have just had to do with some
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
of that had to do with the expansion of
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
availability for benefits to those
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
placements including I believe tanif so
 
03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
um Senator Bradley's um s SP 498 cleaned
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
up some of the law with that regard and
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to what the intent was two
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
years ago of why that choice was made
 
03:36:13.950 --> 03:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
but the current definition of kin and
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
170 G25
 
03:36:19.870 --> 03:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
aligns with both the term kin and
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
fictive kin it's split out here because
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
a blood relative in these terms would
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
have preference over a fictive kin if
 
03:36:33.189 --> 03:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
they both have relationships with the
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
child so that's why here it's kind of
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
split into that tier but in definition
 
03:36:41.189 --> 03:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think we have any issue
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
with it remaining as this body decided
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
two years ago to just simply expand
 
03:36:47.790 --> 03:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
definition and again it may have to do
 
03:36:50.590 --> 03:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid billing or or just the way
 
03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
benefits are given that it didn't make
 
03:36:54.590 --> 03:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
sense to create two separate definitions
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
in that case um but here it's being used
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
differentially just so it's clear re
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
relatives blood and marital relatives
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
come before those fictive kin placements
 
03:37:08.229 --> 03:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
as far as placement priority follow um
 
03:37:10.030 --> 03:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
as a followup then it seems that we're
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
trying to use a narrower definition of
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
kin as opposed to what's in our statutes
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
in 17 G25 when you're talking about the
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
blood rated kin and then adding that
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
term of art that is expands upon it
 
03:37:24.910 --> 03:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
would it be clearer to wherever that
 
03:37:27.189 --> 03:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
there's fictive kin say kin as defined
 
03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
in 170g 25 and then when you're trying
 
03:37:32.349 --> 03:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
to call out the blood related kin so we
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
don't mess with those other benefits say
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
a prioritization to Kin with a blood
 
03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
relationship to the child before other
 
03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
kin as defined in RSA 170 dg2 I think
 
03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that would potentially be appropriate I
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
I think the way it is defined
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
currently that's why we say fictive kin
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
because it's still kin um but that that
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
could be a potential um solution if it's
 
03:37:57.550 --> 03:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
concerning to you that that that term
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
fictive k um we would strongly encourage
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
though that the definition remain the
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
same as it is in current law I think one
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
of the issues that had occurred in a a
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
prior proposed amendment was that it
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
missed that group of people that had a
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
relationship with the family and not
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily the child um I saw one
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
version where it just said you know
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with a child but again you
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
have a kid under five they don't have
 
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
relationships really with anybody
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
they're too young so I would just be
 
03:38:31.630 --> 03:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
careful to maintain that
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
that includes that full definition to
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
include that full breath of people that
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
dcyf policy and practice is currently
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
placing with appropriately so that's
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
helpful if I get one more followup
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
because I have to run to finance with
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
that followup and Then followed by
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative whole um my my concern
 
03:38:49.429 --> 03:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
here is that I was already concerned
 
03:38:50.830 --> 03:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
about some of the language in section
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
three but it seems that you said that
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
it's very limited circumstances I'm just
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
very concerned with laying this out
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
without having any any guard rails is
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
when it's used you know social proof
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
about me saying that JR's a great parent
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
is wonderful except I had a kid down the
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
street everybody knew that his dad was a
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
great parent except he was being abused
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm I don't know I mean to me having
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
that section three is very concerning if
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
we have a clear way to differentiate um
 
03:39:20.349 --> 03:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
between how we look at one family versus
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
another um and I don't know if you have
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
a way to deal with that social proofer
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
if we're getting into policy but I
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately need to have the shepherd
 
03:39:29.790 --> 03:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
hook but I wanted to get that question
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
there so I don't know if you want to
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
follow up with me or answer this and
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
I'll listen to it but I have to run to
 
03:39:36.189 --> 03:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance I I mean I can certainly
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
answer it because I'm sure many people
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
are concerned about that I mean the the
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
narrowness of it starts and and feel
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
free to call me offline if you need to
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um the narrowness of it starts
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
wherein it's it's placed in statute so
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is a very narrow circumstance where
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
one parent out of a biological pair of
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
parents has already been found to have
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected the child and the
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
child is in state custody so you're
 
03:40:09.070 --> 03:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
talking about a situation where the
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
second parent wasn't involved in that at
 
03:40:15.630 --> 03:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
all which that so that's that's already
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
a narrow circumstance that child has
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
been removed often and I can tell you
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
from my experience I spent about five
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
years as a parent attorney in dcyf cases
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
then another couple as a dcyf attorney
 
03:40:30.189 --> 03:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
if there was like a divorced couple
 
03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
where both parents were actively
 
03:40:35.710 --> 03:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
involved usually that child would be
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
safety planned and that other parent who
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the household where the abuse
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
or neglect occurred would be the first
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
person that those the DCF workers are
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
talking to
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
so then this situation wouldn't come
 
03:40:49.469 --> 03:40:49.479 align:start position:0%
into play you wouldn't already have had
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
a finding and now it's the other parent
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
saying hey what about me I saw this
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
section used when the other parent was
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
absent often completely out of state you
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
know I have parents in Arizona parents
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
in California so then that parent is
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
saying Hey I want placement of my kid
 
03:41:08.830 --> 03:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
but the division doesn't know anything
 
03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
about the court who needs to make this
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
order doesn't know anything about that
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
parent and the child really has no
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
relationship with that parent so that's
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
the very narrow circumstance and again
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is only when they've not been able
 
03:41:23.550 --> 03:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
to work it out amongst themselves
 
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
through the normal course of a dcyf
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
assessment this is now a court hearing
 
03:41:31.229 --> 03:41:31.239 align:start position:0%
so the judge has now been asked to
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
decide the parent who didn't wasn't in
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
the household that the abuse neglect
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
occurred in wants the child in their
 
03:41:42.269 --> 03:41:42.279 align:start position:0%
placement still under Court oversight
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
because this is still an active DCF case
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
that parent that has finding against
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
some has 12 months to rectify everyone's
 
03:41:51.550 --> 03:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
receiving Services everyone's still
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
doing monthly check-in so it's a very
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
narrow universe that this occurs at all
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
um if there are more specific questions
 
03:42:03.189 --> 03:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
I can answer those but you know this is
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
a very very small group of people that
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
would ever fall into this bucket
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative hle so I'm going to come
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
back to section three let's jump back to
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
section four right um lines 20 before
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
and following so if I heard you
 
03:42:19.510 --> 03:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
correctly regarding representative lon's
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions we could insert ahead of a on
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
line 26 right with a blood relative or
 
03:42:28.349 --> 03:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent type thing to mean the narrow
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
scope of direct family members and then
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
start with with can or effective kin per
 
03:42:37.229 --> 03:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
one 170 G25 it was that did I hear you
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
correctly so I to prioritize direct
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
family over as the first course So
 
03:42:47.630 --> 03:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
currently when 7 G25 and I want to say
 
03:42:49.149 --> 03:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's paragraph 10 but I could be
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
completely wrong um defines kin has to
 
03:42:56.670 --> 03:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
am I right is it par it's sorry it's um
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
eight actually K means child or children
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
who for which there is a connection or
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
history between the child and or the
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
parents or another responsible adult
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's current law but I thought I heard
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
you say it's important to put blood
 
03:43:12.269 --> 03:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
relatives ahead of that list so I was
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
trying to create I know but I was trying
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
to put that in statue so I was trying if
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
a is kin but kin is broadly inclus
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive of people that are not
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
biologically related do we put ahead of
 
03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
a the first priority is the biological
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
parent or right blood relative might be
 
03:43:35.229 --> 03:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
a grandparent or whatever and then it's
 
03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
all the others that fall under this kin
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
or effective kin per 170 G25 so I would
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
say line 24 captures the the biological
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
parents all right
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're presuming that the family home so
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
that captures relatives I need to look
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
at the actual language but yeah I hear
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
parent right would not necessarily fall
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the family home but you could make
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
the argument that the grandparent or the
 
03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
uncle is the preferred over the friendly
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
n the friend the the friend of the
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
family type thing and I if I heard you
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
correctly right we want to keep within
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
the family is the priority one so I
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
would defer to DHHS on that question
 
03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
because they have policy that lays all
 
03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
of that out okay we put kin and fictive
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
kin together to allow that breath of
 
03:44:24.990 --> 03:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
because you also have uncles who aren't
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
blood uncles but who are closer to that
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
child than say a grandparent that lives
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
in Arizona so again the goal of this is
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
to respect that child's primary
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
relationships in community because you
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
want that child to feel safe and love
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
and secur so whoever that person is that
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
should be the next person beyond the
 
03:44:45.630 --> 03:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
parents obviously
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
03:44:50.149 --> 03:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
say you want that to be as inclusive as
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
possible because you could have
 
03:44:53.070 --> 03:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
situations where there's blood relatives
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
that this kid has never met but you know
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
Uncle Bob lives right next door and you
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
know like I I would hate to narrow it so
 
03:45:03.309 --> 03:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
much that you create problems for
 
03:45:11.229 --> 03:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
three um I understand that you believe
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
this is narrow in scope and I can hear
 
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
that right because for if there's a
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
parent who's absent right if they were
 
03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
involved that we would never have gotten
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
to section three per the way the process
 
03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:28.349 align:start position:0%
to section three per the way the process
works

03:45:28.349 --> 03:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
um but it does kind of read a little bit
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
strong in terms of the person has to
 
03:45:35.670 --> 03:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
prove their innocence as opposed to
 
03:45:41.110 --> 03:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
presumed innocent and DCF or other DCF
 
03:45:44.349 --> 03:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
in this case is the one who had who is
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
tasked with challenging their right so
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
there's no presumption of innocence in
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
this in the way this reads today there
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
is so if you look at um Roman one which
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
has largely not been changed this is
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
current law so the parent has the
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present evidence
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
pertaining to his her ability to care
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
and shall be awarded custody so that's a
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
shall unless the state demonstrates by a
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
preponderance of an Evidence so that
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
actually the burden of proof is entirely
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
on the state the parent doesn't have to
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
provide any evidence at all they are
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
presumed to be a fit parent they can of
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
course present whatever evidence they
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
want but it's a shall they shall be
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
awarded custody unless the state proves
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
by that preponderance which is the same
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
standard across dcyf cases that they're
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
unfit to perform so the presumption is
 
03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
that the parent gets the kid that is
 
03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
more of an affirmative defense as
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to in in my eyes right as
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to their Pres zoed fit period
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
strong language and they shall be
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
awarded in less right yes they're they
 
03:46:54.429 --> 03:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to prove their innocence by
 
03:46:55.830 --> 03:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
show but they still have to request the
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
court hearing go through the court
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to they're a presumed
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
fit parent to start with and that's a
 
03:47:03.469 --> 03:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
very right you're still proving your
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
innocence by just doing the the basic
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
steps of going to the court and
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
listening to all of this you're now
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
proving your innocence via a process as
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to dcyf gets to
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
kick off a court request if they think
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
there is a reason not to presume the the
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
parent is innocent you see the
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
difference and and one actually has more
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
more Court effort associated with it and
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking so I want to be
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
careful about the terminology we're
 
03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
using because this is not criminal so
 
03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's no innocence or guilt so I just
 
03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
want to start there the way this is
 
03:47:39.389 --> 03:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
worded I I know it's worded Strangely I
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
didn't write this original language they
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
do put sort of the cart before the horse
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
but the way this is current worded the
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
parent is presumed fit the issue as I
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
said is that very narrow instance where
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
that parent wasn't immediately present
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
right when that other parent was found
 
03:48:00.910 --> 03:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
to have abused or neglected often they
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
come on the scene later so that's why
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
there's suddenly a hearing because at
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
that point the state already has legal
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
custody of that child because the court
 
03:48:13.389 --> 03:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
found that the parent who had the child
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
in their home had Abus are neglected so
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
the court ordered dcyf to have you know
 
03:48:22.269 --> 03:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
legal custody of this child so that's
 
03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
where it needs a hearing because the
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
court then needs to make a different
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
order presumably this child is placed
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere either with a relative or in
 
03:48:32.710 --> 03:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
foster care the court has to then make
 
03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:33.469 align:start position:0%
foster care the court has to then make
an

03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
order placing the child with this other
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
parent who didn't have the child in
 
03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
their care follow up follow up so
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
so is there any cases
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
where two parents both reside in New
 
03:48:53.229 --> 03:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right they are not they are no
 
03:48:53.239 --> 03:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right they are not they are no
not

03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:56.070 align:start position:0%
not
cohabitating

03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
cohabitating
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
and dcyf steps in because one parent has
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
been charged with a crime or sorry has
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
been accused of of child neglect or
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and the other parent ends up being
 
03:49:12.429 --> 03:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
tripped up by this statute that it
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't go it it doesn't defer to them
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
automatically as the next parent child
 
03:49:20.349 --> 03:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
the state has has possession of the
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
child and or guardianship of the child
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
and then instead of going directly to
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
the parent who was never accused who is
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly fit who lives in the state we
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
get back into section three here in our
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
court and that just takes up additional
 
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
time and and delays how quickly we can
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
return the child back to his
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
family I cannot say personally that I
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
ever saw a case like this honestly in my
 
03:49:48.149 --> 03:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
six and a half years of being involved
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
with dcyf on both sides I only ever saw
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
hearings so and that was not the
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance there um I I mean I can't
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
tell you has that ever happened but th
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
again like this section is used very
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
rarely but there have been some
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the section may have
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
been entirely bypassed or you know in
 
03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
the Montgomery case it was the
 
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts court placing here but
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
this was an issue that they pointed to
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
specifically that a Court's placing with
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
a parent that neither the division nor
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
the court had much information about and
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
now a child is dead um so in my
 
03:50:35.229 --> 03:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
experience the example you're giving is
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
not one I've seen I I couldn't tell you
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
if it's never happened happened one in a
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
million times but this due process
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
occurs with the presumption that that
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
the parent is fit with the burden on the
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
state and just lays out sort of the
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
information that the court may consider
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of this coming directly from cases
 
03:50:58.189 --> 03:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
where children have been grievously
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
injured or murdered um of you know sort
 
03:51:03.070 --> 03:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
of the situation that may have led to
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
that because really the point of 169c
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the overarching definitions you know
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning is it's focused
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
on the safety and Welfare of the child
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
because that then becomes a state
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
liability when children get her in
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
care okay go ahead and proceed thank you
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
very much attorney
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
um I think I was at section 4 169 c19 H
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
or no we talked about that already just
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
kidding I'm already at section six so as
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
we said so section six is Page Three
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
down the bottom line
 
03:51:41.229 --> 03:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
27 169c only applies to children that
 
03:51:43.950 --> 03:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
are involved with the dcyf system
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's also 169b which is Juvenile
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
Justice and 169 D which is chins or
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
children in need of
 
03:51:55.149 --> 03:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
services so
 
03:51:59.950 --> 03:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
169f applies to all three sections so we
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
essentially just took two pieces that
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
I've already discussed and put them into
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
F to make sure that children who are in
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
placement under a juvenile justice case
 
03:52:13.469 --> 03:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
and a child who's taken into you know
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
potentially placement through court
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
ordered chins have those same rights to
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
remain in state near their family and
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
have the same placement preferences
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
because children even if they're placed
 
03:52:26.429 --> 03:52:26.439 align:start position:0%
under a juvenile justice case or a
 
03:52:29.149 --> 03:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
Chin's case should still have the same
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
right to remain with family and get
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
Services kin or fictive kin to be in a
 
03:52:35.790 --> 03:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
foster home you know the idea shouldn't
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
be just be those kids immediately go
 
03:52:40.269 --> 03:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
into residential placement um so that
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
was really just um pulling two pieces
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
we've talked about into 169f to to make
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure that those children also have those
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
same um ability and preferences um 169
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
F7 and 169
 
03:53:02.590 --> 03:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
f8 are the exact same sections that were
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
on hb1
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
1573 but these are the um probably after
 
03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
the seventh amendment in house finance
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
um we work very closely with DHHS as
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
well as the judicial system to try and
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
find language that sort of reduced the
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
workload on the workers and the courts
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
but while keeping sort of the primary
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
Protections in place so and also
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards at that time was
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
was wanting to sort of get the price tag
 
03:53:38.910 --> 03:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
down as well so this language here was
 
03:53:41.309 --> 03:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
the end product of all of those
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
amendments and
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
discussions that kind of kept the bones
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
of those protections of the monthly
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
visits and the judicial oversight but
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
kind of substantially reduced the
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
touches to reduce that price tag so for
 
03:53:58.590 --> 03:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
instance in the judicial piece um
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
initially the bill had been written that
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
any child in care was having either
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
30-day hearings or 60-day hearings
 
03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the life of the case but
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
under conversations with the Judiciary
 
03:54:10.590 --> 03:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
that that would put a huge burden on the
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
courts um as well as as the workers and
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
would mess up the norm three-month
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
hearings now is just one single extra
 
03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
hearing when the kid goes into
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
residential placement and then it just
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
goes back to the regular quarterly
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
hearings that already occur um so
 
03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
similarly in the monthly visits it was
 
03:54:31.469 --> 03:54:31.479 align:start position:0%
reduced a little bit to checkins the
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
amount of spaces they had to see was
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
reduced to just what that child had
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
access to as well as gave um the ability
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
to meet with the therapeutic provider
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
remotely because that is the one person
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty busy at a facility hard to
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
get in touch with um but the leadership
 
03:54:51.229 --> 03:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
and the um Direct Care staff are people
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
you'd be interacting with as you walked
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
around as you looked where the child
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
sleeps as you talked to the child um so
 
03:54:59.950 --> 03:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
those were heavy collaboration between
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
the OCA DHHS and the Judiciary to get
 
03:55:05.469 --> 03:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
the language where it is now um so the
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was substantially reduced
 
03:55:10.590 --> 03:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
from the original bill as it came across
 
03:55:14.670 --> 03:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
so representative H thank you so if if
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
all of section six is is effectively
 
03:55:20.110 --> 03:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
part of the copy from
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
1573 is that bill still where is that
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate so it's just the last
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
two parts so 169 F7 and8 are identical
 
03:55:31.149 --> 03:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
to the last two sections of
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
1573 okay um
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
1573 as it left this body merely became
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
a statement of fact with a million
 
03:55:42.990 --> 03:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
dollars with representative walner
 
03:55:45.630 --> 03:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement it has been heard
 
03:55:47.550 --> 03:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
in Senate Judiciary I believe they're
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
exing it
 
03:55:52.110 --> 03:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay thank you out of Judiciary
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
it has not gone to Senate Finance yet so
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
that one's a few Paces
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
behind this but these sections aren't in
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.149 --> 03:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
so okay anything
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
further um we did just want to point out
 
03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note has been substantially
 
03:56:15.550 --> 03:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
reduced as well is sort of the number of
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
personnel we did just have a couple
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about sort of the number and
 
03:56:21.630 --> 03:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
the types of positions um the positions
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
particularly the worker positions are
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
coming in at a level four so cpsws
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
typically are a a one through four Roman
 
03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
one through four usually hiring is a one
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
or two usually someone right out of
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
college a four is usually a higher level
 
03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
position sort of like who's then
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
mentoring other workers we also note
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
just that um the labor grade in Step
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
coming in at a step five is typically
 
03:56:50.110 --> 03:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
not done I don't know if anyone here's
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
in state service um usually when you're
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
posting you come in a step one you can
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
only get up to a step four beyond that
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
you actually have to get dop approval
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
you can't hire someone at a step five
 
03:57:03.630 --> 03:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a you just you just can't
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
so you know just a little bit of concern
 
03:57:08.670 --> 03:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
about that that level um whether that
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
truly reflects what would actually be
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
hired and what impact that would have on
 
03:57:16.510 --> 03:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note um similarly just some
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with the youth visit travel
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
costs um as we said those monthly visits
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
are currently happening right now that
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
we we have no doubt that those are all
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
happening many of them probably are as
 
03:57:30.670 --> 03:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
thorough as as right in here
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we just encountered some
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
that really weren't so just you know not
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
sure what that extra travel is um in
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
that fiscal budget since they're already
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
doing that travel um with uh you know
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
whether more attorneys are needed for
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
one extra hearing I'm not sure that
 
03:57:51.550 --> 03:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
makes sense in that you know as a dcyf
 
03:57:54.030 --> 03:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
attorney if I had a case already I've
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
gone through the trial I'm doing the
 
03:57:58.590 --> 03:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
dispo I just have one extra hearing for
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
a case that through the life of it would
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
have you know seven or eight hearings I
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that that adds up to two
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
additional attorneys again coming in at
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
a step five um so again we absolutely
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
want there to be enough workers to do
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
the work well um we just want to make
 
03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
sure that that the fiscal note
 
03:58:19.149 --> 03:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
accurately reflects what actual hiring
 
03:58:19.159 --> 03:58:21.469 align:start position:0%
accurately reflects what actual hiring
looks

03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
like all right thank you representative
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
tersi I would just like a clarification
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
yep the copy I just received this
 
03:58:29.950 --> 03:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon there's a fiscal note dated
 
03:58:32.189 --> 03:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
April 2D however I have another copy
 
03:58:34.110 --> 03:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
with a fiscal note May 3rd which is
 
03:58:36.030 --> 03:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
significantly less correct we're working
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
off the May 3rd version that's what I
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
thought okay I want to make sure I'm
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the right numbers thanks so I
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
believe in the May 3rd version lines up
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
with the actual text of what passed the
 
03:58:48.429 --> 03:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
Senate the fiscal note on the one that
 
03:58:51.149 --> 03:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
passed didn't match with the actual text
 
03:58:53.229 --> 03:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
so I think the update was just to match
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
it to the text Which is
 
03:58:59.469 --> 03:58:59.479 align:start position:0%
less represent
 
03:59:02.429 --> 03:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Madame chairman and
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and taking my
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
question um if this legislative body
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
took into account a lower grade Staffing
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
rates what effect would it have on the
 
03:59:18.600 --> 03:59:19.990 align:start position:0%
rates what effect would it have on the
fiscal

03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
note I would love to answer that but I
 
03:59:26.349 --> 03:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
cannot okay but perhaps Mr Ripple could
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
or DHHS we just wanted to point that out
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
as it just didn't seem to match with our
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have an immediate answer I
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
would need to take a look at the exact
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
positions that have been requested and
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
the alternative positions that are being
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
suggested um I need to take a look at
 
03:59:51.309 --> 03:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
the the salary and benefits for the the
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
alternative positions follow up yes
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
could I ask uh Mr Whipple and HHS to
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
work together and give us a revised
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that shows the lower rates
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
advocacy yep I can I can definitely give
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
you the difference in cost we won't
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
update the actual fiscal note but I can
 
04:00:15.229 --> 04:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with that
 
04:00:15.239 --> 04:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with that
information

04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
yes great and I would like to we we're
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
not necessarily recommending we're just
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
asking why those and and perhaps they
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
have an answer of why they're coming in
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
at level fours step FES it just seemed
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
it caught our attention as something
 
04:00:34.110 --> 04:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
unusual as not a typical
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
practice and just to clarify the reason
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't update the fiscal Noe is
 
04:00:39.630 --> 04:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
because the bill itself specifies the
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
exact positions the department shall
 
04:00:43.469 --> 04:00:43.479 align:start position:0%
hire for so the fiscal note reflects
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
what's in the Bill itself but I can
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
definitely give you the cost of the
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives great thank
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
you so a a SE a different cost would
 
04:00:58.349 --> 04:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
result in an
 
04:01:00.910 --> 04:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
amendment representative whole thank you
 
04:01:03.550 --> 04:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple could you also note on that
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note what the text would need to
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
change in sections 8 and section
 
04:01:10.030 --> 04:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
whatever relative if we were to
 
04:01:12.670 --> 04:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
implement a different different language
 
04:01:14.189 --> 04:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
there what the cost reduction would be
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
wer I have an amendment for uh section
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
three that I'd like to like us to look
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.800 --> 04:01:54.990 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
you representative wer would you like to
 
04:02:01.750 --> 04:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
speak to your Amendment yes in section
 
04:02:05.229 --> 04:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
three where it says a parent who has not
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
been charged with abuse or neglect under
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:15.000 --> 04:02:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:02:19.630 --> 04:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
says shall be afforded upon request a
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
full Hearing in the district or Family
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
Court why do they need a fo full hearing
 
04:02:26.110 --> 04:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
if they haven't been charged with
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
anything I would change that language to
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
say shall be deemed a fit
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
parent this may be challenged with a
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
full Hearing in the district may be
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
challenged but why start off with making
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
more work if the parent hasn't been
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
accused of anything thing why do they
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to start with a
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
hearing and the other change is at the
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
bottom of um all the letters on the
 
04:02:56.189 --> 04:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
second page you see all the letters a
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
through G I would change them I would
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate U change a letter a and re re
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh renumber the rest of
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
them to a through F and then the last
 
04:03:13.239 --> 04:03:14.910 align:start position:0%
them to a through F and then the last
thing

04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
on that paragraph that's that's in
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
italics on about line 15 on page
 
04:03:24.870 --> 04:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
two after um shall be weighed as a
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
factor in the fitness of the parent a
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
new sentence the fact that a parent owns
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
a firearm shall not make a home
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
unsafe like to add that because some
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
some people get carried away with that
 
04:03:37.199 --> 04:03:44.550 align:start position:0%
some people get carried away with that
stuff

04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you chairman wer
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
for bringing this amendment um I have
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
one other remaining question in here the
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
on lines 24 through
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
25 um you kept the lines a parents
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
failure to cooperate with the
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
Department's assessment or to provide
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
any records necessary to such a
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
determination shall be weighed as a
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
factor in the fitness of that parent um
 
04:04:10.750 --> 04:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just concerned somewhat about
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
somebody having to prove that they're
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
innocent when they haven't been accused
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
used of anything and the idea that not
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
cooperating when there's not a lawful
 
04:04:21.550 --> 04:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
order um it just seems to be blurring
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
some lines to me and that line is
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
concerning to me for that reason it's in
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
the current law and you retained it in
 
04:04:27.640 --> 04:04:30.189 align:start position:0%
the current law and you retained it in
the

04:04:30.189 --> 04:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
Bill Madame chairwoman may I address yes
 
04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:45.189 align:start position:0%
Bill Madame chairwoman may I address yes
please

04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll start with the removal of
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph a the unique needs of the
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
child and whether or not the parent is
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared to address those
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
needs um that language came directly out
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the Massachusetts oca's report on
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
Harmony mcgomery as one of the primary
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
factors that led to her Murder by her
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
father that Harmony had some unique
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
needs um and that Mr Montgomery was not
 
04:05:16.349 --> 04:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
able to meet those needs um which I'm
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
sure we've all heard the graphic
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
testimony of how exactly she died um
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
that is the only section of the proposed
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill that actually directly addresses
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
the child and those child specific needs
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of the language of this
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
section addresses the parent and the
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
parents um you know existing
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
relationship substance use issues again
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of that did come out of the
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
harmony Montgomery case but but in a
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the child deaths we see
 
04:05:49.469 --> 04:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
particularly murders at the hands of
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
parents these are children with unique
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
needs they're usually very young five
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
and under they may be on the spectrum
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
they may have medical issues um you know
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
emotional or behavioral issues that that
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
are challenging to parent you know
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
rightfully so often they haven't been
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
fully um evaluated and aren't receiving
 
04:06:12.349 --> 04:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
services for those issues which again as
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we all know it's it's
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
challenging to parent a child with those
 
04:06:19.229 --> 04:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
unique needs so I would
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
just strongly encourage this body to
 
04:06:25.149 --> 04:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
think about Harmony and that situation
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that that language is very directly
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
addressed at that situation um as far as
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
the um the the parents failure part in G
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
that was amended by Senator bird Cil to
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
to read as it reads now um that the
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
parents failure to coop operate or
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
provide records necessary to to weigh
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
all that stuff up above I mean that's
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
like a lot of stuff that only the parent
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
would know dcyf and the Court's not
 
04:06:55.389 --> 04:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
going to know if the parent doesn't
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
cooperate with them and again this is
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
focused on the child safety and
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
well-being if a parent can simply say
 
04:07:02.710 --> 04:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tell you if I have a
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
substance use issue I'm not going to
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
tell you where I live or how I live I'm
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
not going to tell you if I even know
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
anything about that child under current
 
04:07:13.990 --> 04:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
law the family court has discretion to
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
weigh the evidence given the the weight
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
that the court believes it deserves so
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
that sentence is really more notice to
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
the parent I mean if you don't want the
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
parent to have notice but that happens
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
if DCF goes in and says this parent
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
didn't tell us anything we we can't tell
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
you anything about this person or their
 
04:07:37.229 --> 04:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
relationship with this child or their
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
ability to meet that child's needs the
 
04:07:42.030 --> 04:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
judge is going to weigh that because
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's the information the court now has
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
is we don't know anything about this
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
person um
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
so it really already kind of works that
 
04:07:52.750 --> 04:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
way the court then weighs that because
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
how are we supposed to make a
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
determination with no information so
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
this was
 
04:08:03.229 --> 04:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
really more aimed at a parent to say
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
Obviously that's your choice you don't
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
have to cooperate if you want don't want
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
to but the Court's job in this instance
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
is to weigh the safety and well-being of
 
04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
that child if the State as the guardian
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
of that child is it going to place that
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
child in that person's care so in order
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do that if you have no information to
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
go on that's a problem for the court
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
so that sentence is really meant as a
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
statement of this is how this process
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
works absolutely the state has to has
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof the person is
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
already um presumed fit as already in
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
current law but it's really hard to tell
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
whether a child's going to be safe with
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
a person whether it's a parent or
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
someone else if you don't know anything
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I would just put that out there as
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
information for you representative whole
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.880 --> 04:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
Leon

04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
Leon
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
sure um so let's go to the unique needs
 
04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
of a child is there any way to better
 
04:09:05.070 --> 04:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
explain that because that can be a very
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
broad language and unique needs could be
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
medical could be emotional could
 
04:09:14.670 --> 04:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
be um Behavior as you said on the
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
Spectrum but unique needs could be very
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
broad as well so can the department
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
provide some clear Insight what they
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
want for Unique
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
needs I I would defer to the department
 
04:09:29.550 --> 04:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
on that I mean I have talked to a lot of
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
different people and invited everyone
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
anyone to offer language that would
 
04:09:38.429 --> 04:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
cover the situation that led to the
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
murder of Harmony Montgomery the murder
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
of Elijah Lewis the murder of buou Von
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
what would fully capture the spectrum of
 
04:09:50.990 --> 04:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
of challenging needs unique needs the
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate you know
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
supports this language because that is
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
what came directly word for word out of
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts office of child
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
Advocates report on Harmony certainly if
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
you can find a a universe to
 
04:10:09.790 --> 04:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
Encompass those unique needs that would
 
04:10:12.149 --> 04:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
potentially um put that child's life in
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
danger if a parent was not not like
 
04:10:18.030 --> 04:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to care for that I absolutely
 
04:10:20.910 --> 04:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
be open to that or open to DCF coming up
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
with language that they thinks
 
04:10:26.189 --> 04:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
encompasses that situation okay and then
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
to lines 12 13 14 right relative to a
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
parent's failure to cooperate with a
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
Department's assessment right that's
 
04:10:36.750 --> 04:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
written as a stick just if you don't do
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
this we're going to hold it against you
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
which is as opposed to a parent's
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the Department to right
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
you could write it as a carrot
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
too um it is written currently written
 
04:10:51.109 --> 04:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
as a we will we will hold this against
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
you you have to prove your innocence and
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't prove your innocence we're
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
going to hold it against you as opposed
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
to you have the opportunity to show us
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
why you're we you would be the right
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
choice and it words matter the failure
 
04:11:05.109 --> 04:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
to cooperate comes across this very
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
strong language relative to we're going
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
to hold this against
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
you I hear what you're saying um I think
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
you know the first paragraph already
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
sets up the burden is on the state the
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know the parents already
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
um you could I think Senator burdell's
 
04:11:27.870 --> 04:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendment made it such that it simply
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
weighed as a
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
factor do you know what it said before
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
it I do it said it will be weighed
 
04:11:36.269 --> 04:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
against the fitness of that parent and
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
it was changed to just weit as a
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
factor um you could potentially I think
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
it may hold the the same weight if it
 
04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
said a
 
04:11:49.710 --> 04:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
parent's failure to provide you know the
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
records requested necessary to make such
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
a determination I I think G is trying to
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
encapsulate that a through f is what the
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know Department's looking for to
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
present to the court to may we as
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
factors so G is sort of a summary
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
so that assessment yep is then you know
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
used well that's what's used to present
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
the state's case essentially
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
um I I think the court being presented
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
with little to no evidence because the
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
parent chose not to provide it yes there
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
probably is a nicer way to say that than
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
failure to cooperate but the essence of
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
it is if everybody shows up in court and
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
the department says we can't really tell
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
you anything judge because this parent
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
didn't answer any of our questions let
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
us into the house provide any
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
information do what you will with it
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
Court that's sort of that paragraph is
 
04:12:44.880 --> 04:12:46.630 align:start position:0%
Court that's sort of that paragraph is
going

04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
I sorry I think this goes to the heart
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that um represent
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
chairman Wier provided to us right which
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
is we're still back to the parent
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
needing to do enormous amount of effort
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
to prove their
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
innocence relative to
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
being considered a potential place or
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
place a potential place to place the
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
child and it's this type of verbiage
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
here here that kind of is this huge arm
 
04:13:18.990 --> 04:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
twisting by government to mandate
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
someone's innocence and I'm trying to
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
get away from that I'm trying to get to
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
a paradigm where the parent or the
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
effective kin is Presumed Innocent in L
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
type this only applies to the biological
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
parent okay not kid this is purely when
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
a biological parent who was not you
 
04:13:41.109 --> 04:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
typically normally on the table at the
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of a case is now coming in
 
04:13:42.760 --> 04:13:43.830 align:start position:0%
beginning of a case is now coming in
saying

04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
M I know my child's been removed from
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
that other parent here I am um paragraph
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
one in the in the bill not in the
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is how the law stands now I I
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
agree that the wording is a little
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
clunky the presumption is there though
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
that that parent is fit the burden is
 
04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
entirely on the state to prove they're
 
04:14:07.109 --> 04:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
unable to care for the child but again I
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
I would shy away from the word innocent
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
because this isn't a criminal case but
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
in 169
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
the court is tasked with protecting the
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
not just the court DCF right the whole
 
04:14:24.510 --> 04:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
reason they exist is to protect the the
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of children
 
04:14:29.149 --> 04:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're not just running around taking
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
children away from parents like this is
 
04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
already a situation where they've
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
investigated they found that the the
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
current caregiver of the child has
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected that child something
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
has happened to that child child is now
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
court ordered into State care this is is
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
the situation we're in so now it's up to
 
04:14:48.109 --> 04:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
the court in dcyf to make sure that
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
child remains
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
safe so it does presume the parent is
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
fit but that piece of the welfare of
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
that child being the primary factor now
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
when the court determines where I'm
 
04:15:05.950 --> 04:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
going to court order that child to live
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
these factors weigh in so I I do hear
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from of how that
 
04:15:12.199 --> 04:15:13.670 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from of how that
feels

04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
feels
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
but I just want to be careful about this
 
04:15:18.510 --> 04:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
does still presume Fitness and there's
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
not guilt or innocence this is not a
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding it's merely to
 
04:15:22.159 --> 04:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding it's merely to
protect

04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
children representative Leon um thank
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman and thank you um I I
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
I still come back to this unique needs
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the child we need to Define that
 
04:15:35.149 --> 04:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
better because if a child is a drummer
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and the other parent lives in an
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
apartment where it's going to be a
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem for them that would be a unique
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
need where they might not place them
 
04:15:44.109 --> 04:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
with it with that parent I know that
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
seems kind of out there but we need to
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
be careful with what our language says
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
and legislating um out of emotion from
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
something even as tragic as what what
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
was experienced we just need to make
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
sure we're more precise in the language
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
so I really would encourage better
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
language I am not a social worker even
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
though I play one on TV occasionally I
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
am an attorney I would you know I think
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great question to ask dcyf
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
maybe an actual field worker or an
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
assessment worker you you know the folks
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
that are doing the work in the field
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
that would be reading this or or any
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
definition of how they would interpret
 
04:16:22.510 --> 04:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
that honestly from my background in this
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
field I would never think to interpret
 
04:16:28.149 --> 04:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
that to mean a kid wants to play the
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
drums loud you know when when I see
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
unique needs of a child I do think about
 
04:16:34.880 --> 04:16:36.109 align:start position:0%
unique needs of a child I do think about
those

04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
challenging medical behavioral you know
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
emotional disregulation so you know I
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
would in you to ask social workers
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
especially like DCF field assessment
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
workers You Know Field administrators I
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
I think Marie's still here Marie Nan
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
who's the director of DCF um how they
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
would interpret that because again there
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
are terms of art that are used in social
 
04:17:05.710 --> 04:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
work in this field that
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't begin to say but I would
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
never have occurred to me that reading
 
04:17:13.710 --> 04:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
this that's what someone would interpret
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
it to say you can't parent your kid
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
because you live in an apartment like
 
04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a number of reasons why
 
04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
that would not be the case um but I I
 
04:17:22.349 --> 04:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question for them
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
if they have some other idea how to
 
04:17:26.830 --> 04:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
capture those situations and use a more
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
definitive terminology
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you attorney masso
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's quite a lot but you
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
presented very well and very clearly and
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that and I'm happy to work
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
with anyone if you have Amendment
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
language or you know we we're here to
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
collaborate and uh keep the world safe
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
for kids thank you at this point uh if I
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
could have maybe uh Miss Morris um Miss
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
Nan come
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
forward uh there are a few broad topics
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
here that were touched upon in the last
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
hour that perhaps you could give
 
04:18:02.590 --> 04:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
clarifying thoughts on I can list them
 
04:18:05.309 --> 04:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
to sort of narrow
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
this definition of
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
kin Warehouse Bill 1573 relates to
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
417 I know there is an audit process
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
going on currently where we are with
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
that and where these bills fit into that
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
and then just most recently unique
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
needs so if we could um begin with that
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
and then whatever additional comments
 
04:18:36.510 --> 04:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
you want to those four that would be
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
helpful representative wer could I get
 
04:18:38.840 --> 04:18:39.550 align:start position:0%
helpful representative wer could I get
the

04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:42.030 --> 04:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
names sure uh my name is Christa Morris
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%

04:18:48.109 --> 04:18:48.119 align:start position:0%
Affairs first name again Christa k r i
 
04:18:50.910 --> 04:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
s Morris
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
Morris hi good afternoon Marie Nunan n o
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
DCF thank you representative walner were
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
you going to suggest that as well I was
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
I was just going to add to the list that
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
they go over the um fiscal
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.590 --> 04:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
note so five broad topics there um to be
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
discuss thank
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
you sure so we can start with the
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
fictive kin piece um this was language
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
brought forward by the OCA and so we
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
haven't really had much input regarding
 
04:19:35.550 --> 04:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
fictive kin um I believe that we
 
04:19:39.309 --> 04:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
supported the the concept of of adding a
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
definition but we
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
also were not opposed to not adding a
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
definition because we already use
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
fictive kin in our in our policy and
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
procedure um and I'll leave do you want
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
to expand on
 
04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
that no
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay um so then regarding 417 SB 417
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
versus hb1
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
1573 um as you may remember this
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee decided to um create a $1
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
million appropriation to the department
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
in hb1 1573
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
that would include um or with
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
that we have to basically use that
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars on items pertaining to
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
the residential treatment of Youth the
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
residential placement of Youth
 
04:20:33.070 --> 04:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
and it was to look at our internal
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
policies procedures see what needs to
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
happen what can we do with that million
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to better our program and then
 
04:20:41.229 --> 04:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
come back to you later on in a reporting
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
requirement uh brought forward uh on the
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
floor to then just say what what changes
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
should be made what do we need to do and
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
then how do we come back to you later on
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
to ask for those changes if if they need
 
04:20:57.550 --> 04:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
to be be statutory and to provide you an
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
update that is currently with Senate
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
Finance or Senate Judiciary I believe um
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
Lisa stated that and that is due to be
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
exec out
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um I've heard Rumblings of an
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
amendment but I'm not sure I haven't
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
seen one so I don't really know um where
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
that is but currently I would say there
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
is no policy overlap between the two
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of changed within this
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
committee before it went to the
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
floor representative walner sort of
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
jumping ahead here but is there any
 
04:21:36.070 --> 04:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal overlap so the million dollars
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
1573 as it left here with no real
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
definition as to how it was going to be
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
spent Could That Could those funds be
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
used for any part of the fiscal needs of
 
04:21:50.560 --> 04:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
used for any part of the fiscal needs of
this

04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill in theory yes um the the million
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
dollars was to take uh we did provide
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
actually a um an outline so to speak to
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson she did request that you
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
know what would we look to do with that
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars so I did provide that to
 
04:22:13.229 --> 04:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
her over at Senate Judiciary uh that
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
includes we are currently looking at a
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
system of care uh looking at policies
 
04:22:19.469 --> 04:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
and procedures internally as well as
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
statutes to see what could be changed
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
and what needs to be changed looking at
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Behavioral Health uh database
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
that we would like to set up to be able
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
to streamline more of the certification
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
process things of that nature that we
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
would like to look at as for overlap
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
with Senate Bill
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
417 I mean there could be overlap there
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
it could be but it wouldn't necessarily
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
MH is that it okay so then we have the
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
LBA audit that a close
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
quickly so in
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
April the legislative performance audit
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
and oversight committee did discuss
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
um an LBA audit as to the interplay of
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
the division of dcyf and our Bureau of
 
04:23:21.109 --> 04:23:21.119 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health targeted
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
specifically at this topic um let me
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
read this out loud there's an interest
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
in the interplay between DCF and bcbh
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
which often worked with the same
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
children and how the outof state
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
placements happened so that is also
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to probably come to fruition we
 
04:23:41.309 --> 04:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we will have to engage
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
in that audit and and provide the LBA
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
with our current policies and procedures
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
and how that is um being handled at the
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
time at this specific time right now
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
passing the children's uh Bureau of
 
04:24:09.870 --> 04:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.109 --> 04:24:12.119 align:start position:0%
Health and so we do anticipate that
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
audit will look at things that may be
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
changing due to
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um and and so it may re make
 
04:24:23.790 --> 04:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
re it may end up making recommendations
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
to to current statute that is outdated
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
and that's something um that is just
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
something we kind of have been thinking
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
about this past week as as that audit
 
04:24:37.389 --> 04:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
has come to light um and then we have
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
the unique needs of the child I will let
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
Marie expand more on this however ever
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
the department already looks at the
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
unique needs of the child when it comes
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the mental physical emotional health
 
04:24:53.229 --> 04:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
of the child so as for a definition we
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
could include some of that language but
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
really um it's something that is already
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
done within the department so to provide
 
04:25:00.239 --> 04:25:02.229 align:start position:0%
done within the department so to provide
a

04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
definition I I don't really know but if
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
Marie could go ahead and expand on that
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
sure when we're looking at the best
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
place uh safest place for any child we
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
certainly do take into account their
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
unique needs and and if I were to think
 
04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
about defining those they would include
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
things like um the unique safety needs
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
of that child um emotional mental health
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
educational needs developmental needs
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
and medical needs um so that was the
 
04:25:31.469 --> 04:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
list that I um came up with as we sat um
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
advocate representative Leon um thank
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman and thank you for
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
that um bringing up the educational
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
needs um could you let me know how
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's prioritized is homeschooling
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
looked at differently as than public
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
school than private school than Charter
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
or are they viewed on an equal playing
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
field those would be viewed on an equal
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
playing field it would be uh when I
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned education it would be is the
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
child experiencing an IEP um is the
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
parent able to meet whatever needs might
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
come up through that certainly that's a
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
School driven process but is the parent
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
able to um follow through with any
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
requests of the school and and whatever
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
is unique about the child's needs not
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily the location of the of the
 
04:26:22.800 --> 04:26:27.149 align:start position:0%
necessarily the location of the of the
school

04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.910 --> 04:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
placement okay anything further
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
for um yes go ahead uh yep and then
 
04:26:36.750 --> 04:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
there was the fiscal note request right
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
note I know there are questions about
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
the level of Staffing uh we did have a
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
recent reclassification go through at
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
the state and so we that that does play
 
04:26:51.550 --> 04:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
into this include to include those
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
higher level staff but also uh the the
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
reason for the higher level staff the
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
higher level CPS WS is partially because
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
these cases are much more detailed
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're much more intense and so you
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
want those those staff who are at a
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
higher classification level we are able
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
to hire at a higher um
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
at rating it's just we may not be able
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
to but we are able we're able to it
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we'll have the applications
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
for it I guess is the way to word that
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
um so really it boils down to we are
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
able to and again these are higher level
 
04:27:29.550 --> 04:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
cases these are much more intensive so
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
you want those people with more
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
experience who are going to be able to
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:39.790 --> 04:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
cases representative
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
priest thank you madam chairman for for
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
being here back to your audit it sounds
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
very much what you're doing now for your
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
audit for this problem that what we are
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
what you are being requested by HB
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
1573 I mean the
 
04:28:01.560 --> 04:28:04.510 align:start position:0%
1573 I mean the
similarities

04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
similarities
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
are are are they similar and if so is
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is HB
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
1573 a duplication of what is being done
 
04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the audit right now the audit I think
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
would be supplemental to 1573 like I
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
said 1573 would allow us to put some
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
money towards uh creating a new database
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
if if that's what our findings come to
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
um that came out to I think
 
04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to be able to create the the
 
04:28:35.349 --> 04:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
certification database so that we can
 
04:28:39.309 --> 04:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
allow the OCA viewing access to view
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
those files rather than us having to
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
bring a thumb drive over to them it
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
would also allow us to start possibly
 
04:28:48.189 --> 04:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
the implementation and working with uh
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
any findings within an audit internal or
 
04:28:52.990 --> 04:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
external from the LBA it would allow us
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
to start working on making those changes
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
trying out new programs trying out new
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures to make sure
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
they work and are are effective for for
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
Youth followup and as a followup again
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the unique needs again is that is
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
that explained or defined in a place
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
access I'm not certain if it's in our
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
DCF policy I can look at that and get
 
04:29:34.269 --> 04:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
back to the back to you in the in the
 
04:29:34.279 --> 04:29:36.990 align:start position:0%
back to the back to you in the in the
committee

04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the considerations that we take into
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
place in in having that less restrictive
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
or least restricted placement is
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
certainly outlined in our policy I don't
 
04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
know whether unique I doubt is is
 
04:29:51.109 --> 04:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
defined explicitly but the ways in which
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we assess for meeting a child's
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
needs would be in our dcyf policy follow
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
up as a followup you know I can see the
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
unique needs because of the background
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
that I have come from um having a
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
brother who has unique needs but you
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
know there is some
 
04:30:16.750 --> 04:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
others out there that may conru it
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
totally different so I think that would
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
welcome okay anything further for Miss
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
Morris or Miss
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
Nan okay are others here wanting to
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
speak on Senate Bill 417 sure come
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
forward and just be sure to introduce
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
yourself naturally and make sure your
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
on you've been waiting very patiently so
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I'll try
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
and be very brief um I'm Heather Raymond
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
I'm the representative for NASA
 
04:30:59.469 --> 04:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 5 um I'm on the child
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
and family law committee um and just a
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of background um before I
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire I was a forensic
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
interviewer in New York state um I work
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
for child protective there um and also
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
with our local law enforcement
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
interviewing child victims of sexual and
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
physical abuse um and then I worked at
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
DCF until 2014 um and then I worked for
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
Casa for a year as a program manager um
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
and then I got a brain tumor and then I
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
got better and now I'm here um so I know
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit but my day-to-day experience
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
in the field is about 10 years old um I
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention um a couple of of
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
things on the bill and and the amendment
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
um we talk a lot about unique needs of
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
the child and I know that that people
 
04:31:44.109 --> 04:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
are are struggling with that definition
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
just want to remind us all that in these
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances these are children who
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
have been already found to be abused and
 
04:31:54.030 --> 04:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
neglected and they're being potentially
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
placed with a parent who does not have a
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
relationship with them so typically this
 
04:32:00.910 --> 04:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
is a parent a child for example Harmony
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
mon gony we know who lived in
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who had some developmental
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
delays and she's being placed with a
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
parent that no one has ever met with no
 
04:32:13.149 --> 04:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
questions asked and fre quently this is
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
what happens when you have a parent who
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't been involved we have to make
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
sure that the parent who is now going to
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
assume custody of a child who has
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
experienced a traumatic event is
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
prepared for the level of stress that
 
04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
will come with that type of parenting
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
and that they are prepared to meet the
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
child's individual needs so we have to
 
04:32:41.590 --> 04:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
look at whether or not the parent is is
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
um has the capacity to do it and if they
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't dcyf needs and the court system
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
needs a way of um providing services for
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
that parent where they're not just
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
dropping them off and wiping their hands
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
of it so for example um you wouldn't
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
take a child who is deaf and doesn't
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with one of their
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
parents who doesn't speak sign language
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
and just drop them off and walk away
 
04:33:08.429 --> 04:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
without making sure that that parent can
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
a communicate with the child and B
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
access services for the deaf this is a
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
real issue here in New Hampshire where
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
there is only one place where a child
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
can receive those Educational Services
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
and that is in nsha so it this is
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
something that a judge really should be
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
thinking about so that they can help the
 
04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
parent to get there um the office of the
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate mentioned several child
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
deaths that we've had over the last
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
several years and in almost every one of
 
04:33:36.269 --> 04:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
those cases there was a child with a
 
04:33:38.429 --> 04:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
developmental delay a child who was
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
non-verbal or a child with other medical
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
or development Al needs that was placed
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
with a parent who didn't know anything
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
about the child's developmental needs
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
and wasn't given any assistance on how
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
to meet them and so if we take away the
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
language that allows the court to
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
consider those needs then we're staying
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the same position where we're taking
 
04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
kids literally out of the frying pan and
 
04:34:03.310 --> 04:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
potentially putting them into the fire
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
so just I want to be really clear about
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
how dangerous and not Child Focus this
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
is so we want kids to have relationship
 
04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
ship with their parents but we want
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
those relationships to be successful and
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
healthy especially when the state is
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
going to be on the hook for liability
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
for placing a child with a parent who
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
then murders them because you better
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
believe that that first parent is going
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
to sue the state so um so that's on that
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
section um regarding kin I just wanted
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
to bring to the committee's attention um
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that we had
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
received in our committee um about a
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
family where they was um Mom and Mom's
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
long-term boyfriend who'd been involved
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the children since they were like
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
babies um biological dad is no longer
 
04:34:53.789 --> 04:34:53.799 align:start position:0%
around um when those children needed
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
placement they went to boyfriend's
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
grandparents because they had known
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
those grandparents since babyhood and
 
04:35:04.429 --> 04:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
they were the closest relative but there
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
was no DNA shared there so we want to be
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
careful that we're not going to ship
 
04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
kids like that off to you know
 
04:35:14.429 --> 04:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
or Minnesota or someplace because they
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
have an aunt there when there are
 
04:35:20.109 --> 04:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
fictive grandparents who live next door
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing I would like
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
to say is just on um the fiscal note um
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
417 asks for eight child protective
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
workers two jpos and two attorneys um in
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
testimony in our committee um we learned
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
that there are less than 10 children
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
placed out of New England it's actually
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
I think gone down since then so I don't
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
know why we need eight additional
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
workers to visit 10 children um and I
 
04:35:50.189 --> 04:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
would hate to see a bill that does a lot
 
04:35:52.830 --> 04:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
of good get tanked because of um an
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
overinflated cost so those are my three
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
points and I know we've talk this bill
 
04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
to death today thank you representative
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon um thank you madam
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
being here and providing this
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
information um you're on child and
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
family law and I believe the committee
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment came out with support of the
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
full early to pass his Amendment came
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
out with full support that's not true
 
04:36:17.070 --> 04:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment did not pass
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
with full support the committee
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
amendment was split sorry but you voted
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
on not to pass as amended so I voted
 
04:36:26.189 --> 04:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
against it as did um representative Greg
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I thought it had come out
 
04:36:29.789 --> 04:36:29.799 align:start position:0%
with a unanimous from the committee so I
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
thought that's what the record said it
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
did not and we corrected that for the
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
record um we both Greg uh representative
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
Greg and I um had significant concerns
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
about unique need of the child um and so
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
we voted against it on the day of the um
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing okay thank you because
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the record says the vote was 11 Zer um
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where the confusion comes if
 
04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
you have other language for The Unique
 
04:36:56.830 --> 04:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
needs it seems that there is are those
 
04:36:59.070 --> 04:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
specific points I mean I think that
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
personally I think that it could be you
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
could you could stretch it out instead
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
of unique needs you could talk about the
 
04:37:07.709 --> 04:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
individual educational emotional
 
04:37:10.590 --> 04:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
developmental you know Etc needs my
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
concern with really listing them all is
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
what if we miss one
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
right I go back to um how we started
 
04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
over an hour ago with the uh the docket
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
online for this bill is not accurate and
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct I've brought this to the
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
attention first of all the first line is
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
not accurate it's a duplicate of like
 
04:37:33.789 --> 04:37:33.799 align:start position:0%
eight lines down and now uh you're
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
saying that there was not a unanimous
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
vote I'm sorry let me let me back up a
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
bit we voted against the amendment I
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day at the end
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
of committee um uh representative Greg
 
04:37:47.230 --> 04:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
and I voted to advance the bill even
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
though we felt that the amendment made
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
it flawed and then during house session
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that as we talked to the
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate and other reps
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that is how the amendment failed during
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
house session so I apologize I misspoke
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
earlier okay thank you anyone else for
 
04:38:03.799 --> 04:38:05.349 align:start position:0%
earlier okay thank you anyone else for
representative

04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
Raymond okay thank you very much very
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
okay anyone further on Senate Bill 417
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes please come forward and of course
 
04:38:24.750 --> 04:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
microphone good afternoon Aaron krian
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
General Council for the judicial branch
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
um because the judicial branch does not
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
take policy positions the very important
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions that you have been weighing
 
04:38:37.230 --> 04:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
are not questions that I can help you
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
with but I certainly can uh raise just a
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
couple technical issues for judicial
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
implementation of your policy Vision uh
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
one of them is relatively small I think
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
it was in the um amendment that was
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
rejected for other reasons but in a
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
couple of places section four section
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
six there's a reference to presuming
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
that remaining in the family home is in
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child under
 
04:39:02.910 --> 04:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law it has to be
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
contrary to the welfare of the child
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
before they're removed from that family
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
home so it is actually a stronger
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
presumption of remaining in the family
 
04:39:12.429 --> 04:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
home uh and so that's one of the things
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
that a judge would might read it and
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that you might be trying to adjust
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
that standard and I don't understand
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
that to be your
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
intention representative hle thank you
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair can you get for us that
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
reference at the federal level that
 
04:39:28.709 --> 04:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
would be great thank
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
you and a a second one which is
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
something that is a little more
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
open-ended and I know this has been a
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of a challenge to resolve but
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
there are about three places in the bill
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
where it refers to the fact that uh the
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
court needs to determine whether the
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
needs of the child cannot be met by kin
 
04:39:46.750 --> 04:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
fictive kin uh or in a foster family
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
home and only if they cannot be met can
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
they be put in residential placement um
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
this leaves a little bit of a gap for a
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
judge in terms of when those things are
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
possible for the child but they're not
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
available we don't have a a kin fictive
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
kin or F or Foster Family Home available
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
this this does unfortunately happen from
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
time to time um what you think should
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
happen in that scenario I'm not trying
 
04:40:14.110 --> 04:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
to tell you uh but the bill is silent as
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
to it and what I wouldn't want is for
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
judges to do something other than what
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
you want to have happen in that
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
situation um whether you want there to
 
04:40:23.628 --> 04:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
be some sort of temporary placement
 
04:40:25.628 --> 04:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
whether you want there to be placement
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
residential gos that is all that is
 
04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
available uh you others may have policy
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
opinions but I don't want judges doing
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
different things because they don't know
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
what the legislator's intention in that
 
04:40:35.360 --> 04:40:36.708 align:start position:0%
what the legislator's intention in that
scenario

04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
is uh and then the very last thing
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
extremely small but in section two
 
04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to district and
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
family court which is in the existing
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
statute uh whenever we can we generally
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
try to fix that to Circuit Court those
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
courts were Consolidated into the
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
2011 thank you any questions for the
 
04:40:57.400 --> 04:40:59.708 align:start position:0%
2011 thank you any questions for the
judicial

04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
branch okay thank you very much all
 
04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
right representative hle I do have one
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
other question for Miss Nunan if she's
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm struggling with right this
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence of the parent
 
04:41:28.948 --> 04:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to better understand
 
04:41:30.990 --> 04:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
let's say there is no parent available
 
04:41:32.910 --> 04:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
for some unfortunate circumstance right
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
there is a parent mom or dad and there
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
is no other direct parent at this point
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
available to place the kid with and for
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
what whatever reason the the relatives
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
are not optioned so we're now looking at
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
foster care we're looking at some other
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
ideally right placement what is the
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
Department's policy how do they then vet
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
option so if there if there is no parent
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
and then there is no relative that's
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
where we expand to the kin meaning just
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
other people that have a relationship
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
and are known to the
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
child so walk me through that process
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
because we have outlined here a very a
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
very detailed process relative to the
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
fitness of the parent in section three
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to understand that
 
04:42:23.230 --> 04:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
process versus the same process that
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be used for some
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
other some other Guardian sure in any
 
04:42:32.350 --> 04:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
case we do have to take into account the
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
child's needs and the prospective
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
caregiver's ability to meet that child's
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
needs so the same set of circumstances
 
04:42:40.590 --> 04:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
that I outlined in terms of any medical
 
04:42:42.590 --> 04:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
needs any developmental needs so that
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
sort of going through that um array of
 
04:42:48.430 --> 04:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
impacts that there may be on a child we
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the person that
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
were're the prospective caregiver is
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
able to meet that child's unique needs
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
and so we would start by meeting with
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
them we would um conduct safety checks
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
um to include criminal record checks we
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
would um assess we would um ask them to
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
sign a release for our own central
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
registry to see if they've been founded
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
of abuse neglect um we do that with um
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
adult and El elderly as well so we'd go
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
through some of those safety checks and
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
then we'd be conducting a home study
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
where we'd meet with them we'd meet with
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
all household members and just be
 
04:43:22.990 --> 04:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
walking through with them what's their
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
relationship what and and and again what
 
04:43:26.910 --> 04:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
is their ability to meet the child's
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
needs okay we'd also think about if I
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
could add some things around permanency
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
so what's the final outcome for the
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
child um initially it's always
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
reunification so their willingness and
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
ability to work with the birth family um
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
so there's there's an aray of things
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we look at to make sure that that
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
the F prospective family would be able
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
to meet the child's needs thank
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%

Morris hi um so this is regarding the
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I know there was a question
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
about the number of cases and I just
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to clarify this was not 10
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
positions or 10 cpsws and then two
 
04:44:10.718 --> 04:44:12.190 align:start position:0%
positions or 10 cpsws and then two
attorney

04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:44:16.030 --> 04:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh for 10 cases our residential
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
treatment in state and out of state and
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
out of region totals for DCF alone 250
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
cases Juvenile Justice is 97 and that's
 
04:44:26.520 --> 04:44:27.868 align:start position:0%
cases Juvenile Justice is 97 and that's
totaling

04:44:27.868 --> 04:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
totaling
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
347 cases so I just want to let you know
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we it is for a larger number um and
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
then if you want to I'm
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
and then Juvenile Justice JJ that's 97
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
youth now if you're also looking at
 
04:44:52.110 --> 04:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
those in the community foster care with
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
Ken um that's another total of
 
04:44:55.718 --> 04:45:05.190 align:start position:0%
Ken um that's another total of
850

04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
cases representative H do you have the
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
current Staffing level numbers to manage
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
that set of almost 1300 kids the current
 
04:45:19.390 --> 04:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
do I have the number or do we are we the
 
04:45:21.628 --> 04:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
number of how many people we have in
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice how many attorneys we
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
have if I recall there was 33 attorneys
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
currently within the department managing
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah I can get those numbers for
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
you representative walner I just
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
wondered if the department has what is
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
your case like running at this point
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
approximately uh 13 cases per case
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
worker and that is about 27
 
04:45:48.718 --> 04:45:50.830 align:start position:0%
worker and that is about 27
children

04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
and what would you anticipate it would
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
drop to with the new positions this is
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
that okay yes just to maintain um
 
04:46:02.670 --> 04:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
because of the extra work that would be
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
required of the staff it would drop a
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
little bit but because it would it would
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
maintain sorry the workload not the case
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
load necessarily uh because of the
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
expanded visits and things of that
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh sort of to recap
 
04:46:23.948 --> 04:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment from
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative Wier it's numbered
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
1768 H and I have as a result of this
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussion about three follow-up items
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
from various people who have testified
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
in front of us that would be helpful for
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
more information to the
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee um I could go over those but
 
04:46:45.628 --> 04:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sure uh individuals have their
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
marching orders essentially for what's
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
needed to have more information come to
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
US Representative hle I have a question
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
for um representative
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
wer it is my understanding that the
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
current schedule has us meeting either
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Monday or Tuesday for a full Finance
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
exact right if if we have stuff to exact
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay this committee meets again
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
Friday and they may have some results
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct and I was going to go to
 
04:47:17.230 --> 04:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill for Friday I have
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
a high interest in this bill
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I am out of state for a
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
college graduation Friday morning um is
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
there a possibility that we ceue up
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
ahead of time the division 3 meeting
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
prior to whatever our next exec is I
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
guess I'm asking this is either for our
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
chair for division 3 or you that we
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
somehow allow for this to be done some
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
other day than Friday no because of
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
other people that had things mornings
 
04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
and T on morning on Monday and Tuesday
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
1:00 Monday afternoon two 1:00 Tuesday
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon we don't have anything the
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
mornings does that help that would be
 
04:47:54.670 --> 04:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
great you'll be able to get here Monday
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon if there's no objections from
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the right the rest of
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
division three to do something on Monday
 
04:48:03.868 --> 04:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
you so you're asking for a another
 
04:48:09.070 --> 04:48:09.080 align:start position:0%

more of the exact for division three on
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
this bill on this bill instead of on
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%

Ripple I'm not sure how far ahead it has
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be noticed it's also possible that on
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
Friday uh the chair if you're chairing
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%

04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.120 --> 04:49:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
Monday

04:49:48.030 --> 04:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
Y what I would suggest to sort of um
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
organize this is that we put this bill
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the calendar for Friday along with
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
everything else we've done today so all
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
10 of these bills are going to appear
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
again publicly noticed for
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
Friday at that point representative
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
Edwards will be chairing this meeting on
 
04:50:11.230 --> 04:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
Friday I'll make it known to him uh the
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
fact that you're absent I know you've
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
made it known to him
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
already and if it's within his purview
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
to recess on Friday and then discuss
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
with all of us our availability on
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
Monday um we'll try to make that work so
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
in other words the Monday availability
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
will be a discussion point for
 
04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
Friday is that
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
fair okay thank you so that's where we
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
are on this
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
um if anyone else has any further uh
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts or ideas for amendments they'd
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
like to bring up now obviously this is a
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
lot to digest and we have some
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
additional information coming forward to
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
us which will be an additional digestion
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
on this um any thoughts or discussions
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
at this point representative Hall I
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
would like to start on an amendment that
 
04:51:03.548 --> 04:51:03.558 align:start position:0%
touches on some of what was in section
 
04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
three in representative wier's Amendment
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
1768 but also address um and clarify the
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
unique need of the
 
04:51:16.110 --> 04:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
child um in section three I guess it's
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
sorry section two and then reference the
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 170 G25 I have a bunch of notes here
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then let's look at the labor
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
positions my only concern is this bill
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
may not make it given the cost this year
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
so we we might want to look back to the
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
number of positions did you say RSA
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
17325 170
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
G25 okay
 
04:51:43.548 --> 04:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
that would be page two line 26 okay
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
we'll expect to see that then when you
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
have it early I think it would be best
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
to circulate it early considering our
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
time frame and also we're reminded uh to
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
remind all of you that all of these are
 
04:51:55.990 --> 04:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
due out by May 16th they have to be out
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
by the house finance committee May 16th
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
so our time is tight uh but uh the
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
sooner you get us that and thank you for
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
the overview the better anything further
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right lots to discuss lots more to
 
04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
come on that I'm sure let's close it
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
then then on Senate Bill
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
417 would anybody object to a
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
five-minute break at this
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
point good uh we're going to take a five
 
04:52:22.590 --> 04:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
minute break and then when we return
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%

minutes

04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.440 --> 04:53:39.430 align:start position:0%

okay we're going to resume after a 5
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
minute break here on on division three
 
04:59:42.638 --> 04:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
minute break here on on division three
house

04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
finance next up is Senate Bill
 
04:59:50.548 --> 04:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
456 and that's an act relative to the
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program for
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
qualified nursing professionals and

05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
therefore so by means of some background
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
this bill started in Senate Health and
 
05:00:08.310 --> 05:00:08.320 align:start position:0%

name though our clerk has not resumed
 
05:00:47.040 --> 05:00:49.788 align:start position:0%
name though our clerk has not resumed
quite

05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
yet hello um my name is Whitney Hammond
 
05:00:56.030 --> 05:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau chief for the Bureau of
 
05:00:57.788 --> 05:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
prevention and wellness in the division
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services which is where
 
05:01:02.430 --> 05:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
our rural health and Primary Care office
 
05:01:04.548 --> 05:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
is located which is the office that
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
oversees the state loan repayment
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
program okay um so I'm here to just give
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of additional detail
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
about what this bill proposes and how
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
that fits with our current um slurp
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
program which is what we call it um so
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
the slurp program is um primarily
 
05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
focused on loan repayment for providers
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
a range of different provider types are
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
now included in the loan repayment
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
including nurses which is what this bill
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
is specifically allocating funding for
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
um we also do loan repayment for
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians dentists behavioral health
 
05:01:47.948 --> 05:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
professionals um the focus is in
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment of those provider types into
 
05:01:53.310 --> 05:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
medically underserved areas in the state
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
so we specifically um support providers
 
05:01:58.030 --> 05:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
who are working in what are called our
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
health professional shortage areas which
 
05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
is a federal
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
designation um the other Focus for the
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
program is in getting providers in
 
05:02:09.070 --> 05:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
Primary Care settings as opposed to
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
inpatient settings this bill would
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate an additional
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
$300,000 to the student loan repayment
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
program for state yet fisal year
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
25 um just for context we have $720,000
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
in state general funds for um State
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 that is already allocated
 
05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
and contracted out with provider types
 
05:02:36.270 --> 05:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
so all of our funding is currently in
 
05:02:38.750 --> 05:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
contract this would be additional to
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
that um what else is important uh the
 
05:02:46.270 --> 05:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
the $300,000 amount for nurses would
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
cover an additional potentially six
 
05:02:52.270 --> 05:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
aprns or up to 10
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
RNs um the the way our program is
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
structured we can um do loan repayment
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
for part-time RNs as well as full-time
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
RNs and just by provider type the
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement amount differs
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
so between six to 10 provider providers
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
would get a additional loan repayment
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
with this 300,000
 
05:03:15.150 --> 05:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation and I'm happy to answer
 
05:03:15.160 --> 05:03:16.310 align:start position:0%
appropriation and I'm happy to answer
any

05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%

any comments on that representative Wier
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
followed by representative walner
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
05:03:49.390 --> 05:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
tersi I missed what you were the bureau
 
05:03:51.548 --> 05:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
chief of it's a new Bureau called
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
prevention and wellness prevention and
 
05:03:54.480 --> 05:03:56.708 align:start position:0%
prevention and wellness prevention and
wellness

05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
and also the people that are getting the
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
720,000 are they also in this same
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
program or in a different program
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
they're in the same program thank you
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
very much and I did you just reminded me
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
there was one other point I wanted to
 
05:04:13.708 --> 05:04:13.718 align:start position:0%
make which is that this bill would also
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
ask that the department establish a new
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program to fund repayment
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
for nurses that don't qualify for State
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
loan repayment and that would be nurses
 
05:04:25.868 --> 05:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
that are practicing and not medically
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
underserved areas as well as in
 
05:04:30.868 --> 05:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
inpatient settings and outside of
 
05:04:30.878 --> 05:04:33.270 align:start position:0%
inpatient settings and outside of
Primary

05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
Primary
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
Care thank you representative
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
walner thank you do you um president we
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
have nurses who are waiting for or I
 
05:04:46.750 --> 05:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
mean I assume you must have some sort of
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
a wait list for the next people who will
 
05:04:52.510 --> 05:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
be eligible for this yeah I can't give
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
specifics I could look I could get them
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
from the program staff um but it is a
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
program that's done on a rolling basis
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
so first come first serve so it there is
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
potential that there are RNs aprns and
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
other provider types that just aren't
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
able to get loan repair because we've
 
05:05:13.150 --> 05:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
already contracted out the full amount
 
05:05:15.628 --> 05:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Madame chairman and
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and the service
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
that you provide um is there any
 
05:05:30.670 --> 05:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
stipulations that the individuals that
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
are receiving the state loan repayment
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
program if they have to stay in the
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
state in these rural areas for a period
 
05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
afterwards thank you sure they so there
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
is a requirement that they sign a
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
contract with their employer that they
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
commit to working for either two years
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.628 --> 05:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
areas representative leyon um thank you
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um if they do not uphold
 
05:06:07.948 --> 05:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
that contract does the contract say that
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
the money is then repaid yes yes they
 
05:06:12.990 --> 05:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
would default thank
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
you so the state loan repayment program
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
includes what
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
else do you mean what else in terms of
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
Provider types yes um so I let me see if
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
I can do this from memory um I know so
 
05:06:31.628 --> 05:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
provider types Physicians um Physicians
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
assistants as I said aprns RN psych
 
05:06:35.638 --> 05:06:36.590 align:start position:0%
assistants as I said aprns RN psych
psych

05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
psych
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
RNs uh Behavioral Health like Masters
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
and so Social Work
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
providers um marriage and family
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
therapists I
 
05:06:48.510 --> 05:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
believe um dentists and then dental
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
hygienists as well those were the most
 
05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
newly added provider types where can
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
that list be found on our website on the
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
website okay and what is that do you
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
have that address by chance oh gosh um
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
if I believe if you Google yeah um New
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
slrp student loan repayment program it
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
will come up okay and I'm happy to
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
link okay representative
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
tersi did have a question after all um
 
05:07:20.430 --> 05:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
when you said that the $300,000 in this
 
05:07:23.548 --> 05:07:23.558 align:start position:0%
bill would cover 10 RNs it doesn't
 
05:07:26.430 --> 05:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
specifically require that it's divided
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
that way are you just saying in general
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
it would okay so some of these portions
 
05:07:34.590 --> 05:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
of can be given out in different amounts
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
or I don't know I'm I'm wondering it
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it is it's a little bit complicated
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
on our website we give the detail of the
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
the different reimbursement amounts so
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
it sort of there are two factors one is
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
if you're full-time or part-time so that
 
05:07:49.390 --> 05:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
would impact how much and how long your
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
contract you know requirement is so
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between two and
 
05:07:55.548 --> 05:07:55.558 align:start position:0%
three years and then your provider type
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
and it tends to be structured where your
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
loan repayment amount is higher based on
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
if the degree type that you have is is
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
likely to be more costly so an MD or a
 
05:08:09.150 --> 05:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
dentist gets a higher reimbursement
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
amount than a um masters in social
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
work I have one other clarifying
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
question please follow up so this isn't
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily a
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
full rep repayment it's just a partial
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
that can go towards correct okay thanks
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
yep so essentially this would add
 
05:08:33.750 --> 05:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
nursing professionals to the group is
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that fair to it is summarize so nurses
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
are currently eligible for State loan
 
05:08:42.990 --> 05:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
repayment so what this would do is to
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
set aside the
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
$300,000 to specifically allocate to the
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
repayment of nurse
 
05:08:51.040 --> 05:08:55.070 align:start position:0%
repayment of nurse
loans

05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay anything further yes representative
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you madam chair um looking
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
at this um the decision to only cover
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
nurses and not um Obstetricians or
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
anybody else that's another area that um
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
we need more providers in was it just
 
05:09:13.470 --> 05:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
because it was the nursing community
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
that came forward with this request I
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
believe it yeah it has to do with the
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
how the bill originated there was an
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
interest in supporting nurses more
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
broadly in the state so the original
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
Bill did not focus in on medically
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
underserved or Primary Care settings
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
you okay anything further uh yes
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you madam
 
05:09:38.958 --> 05:09:39.830 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you madam
chairman

05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
um to your knowledge or do you have any
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
statistics that how many nurses are in
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
need in these rural or disadvantage
 
05:09:56.030 --> 05:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
areas that this bill could pertain
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
to how many nurses are in need in those
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
areas how many yeah nurses are in need
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh in these areas
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
payment um I don't have statistics we do
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
have we so we fund Workforce recruitment
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
efforts through the primary care
 
05:10:16.350 --> 05:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
Association in the state and they're
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
always actively trying to help with
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
recruitment of providers for rural areas
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
the the student loan repayment program
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
the real intent behind it is to actually
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
enable the organizations in these rural
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
areas to to recruit people right so it's
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
I see it more as the the there is a need
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
from these provider um organizations to
 
05:10:41.230 --> 05:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
get nurses into positions and there's
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
just frankly always a need and this can
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
be a a reason that a nurse might choose
 
05:10:48.548 --> 05:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
to work in a rural area or an
 
05:10:48.558 --> 05:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
to work in a rural area or an

05:13:05.310 --> 05:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
proceedings so by means of some
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
background this bill came out of Senate
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary 5 to0 Senate Finance 7 to zero
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%

05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
vote it then went to Children and Family
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
Law and was endorsed there 11 to Z came
 
05:13:25.510 --> 05:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
out of the house on a Voice vote as for
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it looks like the most
 
05:13:33.788 --> 05:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.110 --> 05:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
2024 approximately 1.5 million of
 
05:13:40.830 --> 05:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
General funds in fiscal year 20 26 as an
 
05:13:43.548 --> 05:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
expenditure and .5 million in federal
 
05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
funds and then the same for f fiscal
 
05:13:46.080 --> 05:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
funds and then the same for f fiscal
year

05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
2027 coming from General funds Mr Ripple
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
do you want to add anything to the
 
05:13:52.120 --> 05:13:53.470 align:start position:0%
do you want to add anything to the
fiscal

05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
note the only thing I would point out is
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the bill contains an appropriation
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 25 however you can see
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the effective date of the entire
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
Bill including the appropriation is July
 
05:14:08.430 --> 05:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 which is the first start of the
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
the first day of the next fiscal year so
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
the department wouldn't actually be able
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
to access the appropriation contained in
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
now okay all right welcome Mr Williams
 
05:14:22.270 --> 05:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
and welcome Miss new in once again I
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
take it you're here to talk about Senate
 
05:14:23.920 --> 05:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
take it you're here to talk about Senate
Bill

05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
463 um John Williams director of
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs and with me Marie
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
Nunan interim director for DCF welcome
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
and we're we're here to essentially take
 
05:14:38.190 --> 05:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh the uh
 
05:14:41.110 --> 05:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
Bill does not have a fiscal impact as it
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
relates to the current state fiscal b or
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
the current bium and any impact would be
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
incurred as Mr Ripple had pointed out uh
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
beginning in state fiscal years 26 and
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
27 uh we certainly um are here to answer
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee might
 
05:14:58.270 --> 05:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
have or division three might
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
have so I guess one big one to start out
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
is uh naturally asking in one ask for
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
five new attorneys and 14 Child
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
Protective Services
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
workers uh seems like a lot and if
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
that's a really an accurate
 
05:15:20.110 --> 05:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
staff request for something of this size
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
as I understand 124 children would be
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
affected yes and and to begin with with
 
05:15:28.350 --> 05:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
the five staff attorneys we have to keep
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
in mind what the purpose of this
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and is to expand the scope
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
of access for children in dependency
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
proceedings to having a right to request
 
05:15:41.708 --> 05:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
um um legal counsel to represent them
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
and in that uh capacity the department
 
05:15:48.910 --> 05:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
would also be responsible in those cases
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
to respond to those court appointed
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys I'm an attorney by background
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
even though I'm before you as a
 
05:15:56.788 --> 05:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
legislative director today and attorneys
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
do great work but when they are involved
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's going to be additional motions
 
05:16:01.708 --> 05:16:01.718 align:start position:0%
practice and other issues that will
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
arise that will require additional
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
support from our legal team currently
 
05:16:08.548 --> 05:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
our attorneys are working U very well
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
they they have uh tremendously good work
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
ethics but there are guidelines in terms
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
of case load requirements that they have
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
and this would be an expansion of that
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
work based upon the additional attorneys
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
that we would anticipate being uh
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
employed to represent the legal interest
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
of the these children uh currently the
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
court May appoint as you'll see in the
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
bill that it works on existing um um
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
rsas existing law uh but this would
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
expand it uh to a sha and specific
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
settings you'll see in the new uh bold
 
05:16:44.670 --> 05:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
italics uh in the uh language there it
 
05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
expands it to the scope of children who
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
are in uh placement uh with the
 
05:16:51.310 --> 05:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
Department as well as in certified uh
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
settings as well uh in addition to the
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
request for the five additional
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys and they would be
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
geographically placed throughout the
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
state accordingly so they would not just
 
05:17:01.948 --> 05:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
be centralized they'd be throughout the
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
state to address the important purpose
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the legislation but also the
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
additional uh request for the 14 uh
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Service workers cpsws
 
05:17:14.708 --> 05:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
who would be needed uh because the bill
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
does create an additional new
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
requirement of the department to do a a
 
05:17:22.350 --> 05:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
very robust assessment in terms of where
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
that child may be placed to assist our
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
legal counsil to determine where they
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
might be placed as well as to provide uh
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
guidance uh to the uh child in terms of
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the Bill of Rights of
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
their right to being informed of their
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
right to counsel
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh we had some discussions uh when the
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
bill was before the policy committee
 
05:17:45.470 --> 05:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
that there has to be some thoughtfulness
 
05:17:47.150 --> 05:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
and an understanding that the department
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
acting in that role would be merely
 
05:17:51.070 --> 05:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
providing very important information but
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
would not be legally representing the
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
child at the time that we'd be providing
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
that information so with that we we do
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
stand by the Department's analysis we
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
did it based upon the four corners of
 
05:18:04.548 --> 05:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
the document in front of us we have been
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
um uh requested to provide information
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
as this bill made it through its journey
 
05:18:10.590 --> 05:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
and and refone you do a wonderful job
 
05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the background of the bill
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
give some context but this is not the
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
first occasion that we've had to come to
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
explain why the department provided
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
information as part of our fiscal
 
05:18:22.548 --> 05:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
analysis for the LBA to do their
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
validation of the information that was
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
provided by the department and I would
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
like to turn it over to um our um
 
05:18:29.470 --> 05:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
interim director uh to see if she'd like
 
05:18:33.868 --> 05:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
sure well the appointment of council
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
certainly um could lead to more
 
05:18:40.270 --> 05:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
pleadings in terms of motions um as
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
referenced um in a child's case it it
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
also leads to more communication in
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
general so we would anticipate there's
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
communication around perhaps things like
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
visitation U mental health treatment for
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
the child so that all enhances the um
 
05:18:56.110 --> 05:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
the workload of the child protective
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
service workers
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition um to as John Williams
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
said the the contemplation of children
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
in placement getting ahead of that
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
notifying the court when um in emergency
 
05:19:10.430 --> 05:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
situation when there is the need to
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
place the child residentially so in
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
addition to the staff attorneys the
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
cpsws will additionally take on
 
05:19:19.470 --> 05:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
additional needs and communication and
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
Outreach um there's also a piece in
 
05:19:24.270 --> 05:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
there around um providing the attorney
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
access to to view and copy the child's
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
records so that would as The Keeper of
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
the records um the division would have
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
the child protective service worker um
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
compiling that information so there are
 
05:19:37.350 --> 05:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
additional tasks of the cpsws beyond
 
05:19:40.110 --> 05:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
that which might seem obviously
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys so um I guess the the big
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
question is is there any way it could
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
hires we don't believe that it
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
could uh further in the fiscal note in
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
the methodology it says that the amount
 
05:20:10.270 --> 05:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
appears insufficient ient to fund all 19
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the new positions which is something
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
you don't see every day in a fiscal note
 
05:20:18.270 --> 05:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
uh any comment on that yeah and I think
 
05:20:19.868 --> 05:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple did a very good job
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
explaining uh the Senate heard our
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and there was an Earnest effort
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
made to providing an appropriation uh
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
when the bill was in the Senate as it
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
came to you and it was identified that
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
the um appropriation that was provided
 
05:20:35.708 --> 05:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
was only sufficient for the general fund
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
portion for the five attorneys it did
 
05:20:40.110 --> 05:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
not include the 14 Child Protective
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
Service workers uh I I also the other
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
anomaly with the legislation although it
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
does provide for a $59,000 and some
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
change uh general fund appropriation it
 
05:20:53.708 --> 05:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
it lapses prior to the effective dat of
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
the bill so the department can't
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
encumber those funds so this bill is
 
05:21:00.150 --> 05:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
budget neutral for the the current state
 
05:21:02.590 --> 05:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
banum but there would be the need for
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the resources requested by the
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
department if this were built into the
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
budget for 2627 and again I'll turn over
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
um to um our um interim director um to
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
her her her thoughts so miss I don't I
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to add to
 
05:21:20.110 --> 05:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
that okay representative priest followed
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
by representative Wier followed by
 
05:21:21.958 --> 05:21:23.230 align:start position:0%
by representative Wier followed by
representative

05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
walner thank you madam chairman um
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong is is this going
 
05:21:32.430 --> 05:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
on in in some capacity right now to
 
05:21:35.948 --> 05:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
provide legal service for children that
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
are in need of this uh yes if I can just
 
05:21:42.750 --> 05:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh respond uh the court currently has
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
the discretion to appoint Council and
 
05:21:47.708 --> 05:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that in in primarily very
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
complex cases complex needs for for for
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
the child I I do know that attorney Erin
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
krian uh General Council for the digital
 
05:21:57.070 --> 05:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
branch is also present so she could
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly elaborate on on those as well
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
but in addition to current practice for
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh appointment of council the court does
 
05:22:07.548 --> 05:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
support these children by either
 
05:22:09.788 --> 05:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
Guardian Liam or CA volunteer or others
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
who would support them through through
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
the process um and I would turn to miss
 
05:22:14.548 --> 05:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
Nunan if she has anything else to
 
05:22:17.310 --> 05:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
respond to that question sure well while
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
each situation does have a Caso or gal
 
05:22:23.070 --> 05:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
appointed it is not a common practice
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
for the children to also have an
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
attorney when there's conf conflicts it
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is available to the court to
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
appoint a child and attorney but it is
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
not a common practice follow up sorry
 
05:22:36.910 --> 05:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe it it is reflected in the
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis and again referring to
 
05:22:40.510 --> 05:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch that the numbers
 
05:22:43.390 --> 05:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
were very small in terms of uh the
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
current um children in in the past who
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
have been uh court appointed councel
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yes do you have any uh numbers
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
or statistics that shows how many
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
children are currently served um with Co
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
court appointed attorneys and what is
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
the need for this what is the need for
 
05:23:08.590 --> 05:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
to having five more additional attorneys
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
and 18 more social
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
workers so represent priest thank you
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
very much for for the question the law
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
does change the current requirements
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
currently it's the Court's discretion to
 
05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
appoint Council and as i' mentioned if
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
you reflect to the the fiscal analysis
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
and perhaps uh questions um from the
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the numbers have been
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
very small uh and again as I've already
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
stated in very complex cases complex
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
needs involving the child if the this
 
05:23:42.030 --> 05:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
were to be passed there is now a a
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
default that the child should be
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
receiving um the support of legal
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
council and that certainly would be an
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
increased resource demand to accommodate
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
the goals of the bill so it would um
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
allow it uh for an all dependency
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh proceedings that are
 
05:24:00.670 --> 05:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
meant to you know provide supports to
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
the families to uh at least at a minimum
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
provide um the notice to the child um of
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
their right to ccel and you can we can
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
certainly speculate as to the numbers
 
05:24:15.310 --> 05:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
but it would certainly be much higher
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
than current the current uh um
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
discretionary model that we're expecting
 
05:24:23.390 --> 05:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
that there would be a um a certain
 
05:24:25.868 --> 05:24:25.878 align:start position:0%
Demand on the um on the department as
 
05:24:29.070 --> 05:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
well as the courts uh to to accommodate
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
this new increased access um and again
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
not commenting on the policy certainly
 
05:24:34.708 --> 05:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of the
 
05:24:36.270 --> 05:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but we would need the
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to accom that i'
 
05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
ask Miss n please um chime in I'm not
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
sure that I have anything to add I would
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
just Echo the additional
 
05:24:47.788 --> 05:24:47.798 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um the notification to
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
the child and then the the language
 
05:24:52.670 --> 05:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
round May um appoint councel in all
 
05:24:55.030 --> 05:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
cases but shall in the case of
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
placements so we'll certainly have an
 
05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
increase in in in workload rightfully so
 
05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of the
 
05:25:04.270 --> 05:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative
 
05:25:06.910 --> 05:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
Wier thank you mam chair are we
 
05:25:10.430 --> 05:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
replacing casses and and
 
05:25:14.670 --> 05:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh um the other the other group there um
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ed items no this is not a
 
05:25:18.910 --> 05:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
replacement this would be in
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
addition thank you representative walner
 
05:25:25.830 --> 05:25:25.840 align:start position:0%

thank you so I'm still trying to get my
head

05:25:26.670 --> 05:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
head
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
around this is going to probably at any
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
one time affect about 120
 
05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
children well I think we have about 300
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
children in placement and in residential
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
so all of th those children would
 
05:25:44.270 --> 05:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
receive appointed counsel and then the
 
05:25:46.270 --> 05:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
other children that we serve as well may
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
also be appointed um because we will
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
notify them as their right and they may
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
request that so they may also be
 
05:25:53.000 --> 05:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
request that so they may also be
appointed

05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
councel they all now have a case worker
 
05:26:06.190 --> 05:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
they do so would you how would you how
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
would you use the additional 14 would
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
you reduce case load
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:26:17.948 --> 05:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
existing um protective workers we
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see it as a reduction we'd see
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
it as maintaining the current number of
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
children and families that they're
 
05:26:25.990 --> 05:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
working with um but each each area would
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
receive each district office would
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
receive an additional cpsw to manage to
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
manage that um in addition to the larger
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
offices would would receive
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
two and with the new 14 social workers
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
they would also they would carry a case
 
05:26:44.830 --> 05:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
load correct is that correct yes they
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
would so it would reduce the case load
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
existing I understand your question yes
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
yes it would allow for the increased
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
work um we we talk about case load and
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
workload so we may see a slight
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
reduction in a case load but the
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
increase thank you
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon um thank you madam
 
05:27:10.920 --> 05:27:12.270 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon um thank you madam
chairman

05:27:12.270 --> 05:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify so this would
 
05:27:17.948 --> 05:27:17.958 align:start position:0%
be adding an attorney um appointed for
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
the child on top of a cat Casa and on
 
05:27:23.310 --> 05:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
top of a guardian at letum that's
 
05:27:25.548 --> 05:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
correct that is a that is a very good
 
05:27:28.350 --> 05:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
question this does not include the cost
 
05:27:30.190 --> 05:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
for the actual attorney that would be
 
05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
appointed uh we're speaking on behalf of
 
05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
the department clearly that's our area
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
that we're providing our financial uh
 
05:27:38.510 --> 05:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
analysis or impact um on this there will
 
05:27:40.350 --> 05:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
be others who might be able to comment
 
05:27:42.910 --> 05:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
on the cost for the the attorney and I
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
and I do think that the fiscal analysis
 
05:27:46.548 --> 05:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
was very well done by Mr Ripple and
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually gives you at least uh kind of
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
the the landscape of what that cost may
 
05:27:55.910 --> 05:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
be per attorney thank you representative
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
hle thank you madam chair um thank you
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
for pointing out that the this does not
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
include the costs for the judicial side
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the equation and I see the fiscal
 
05:28:08.590 --> 05:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
note doesn't say that um Mr Ripple can
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
you see if you can get a number from an
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
estimate from them yes I can thank you
 
05:28:18.910 --> 05:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
so um on lines 12 through 14 on page
 
05:28:21.390 --> 05:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
three relative to the positions again
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
these are starting at step five
 
05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
positions for both the attorneys as well
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
as the cpsws is there a rationale for
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
that so in regard to the cpsws um we
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to hire at steps 1 through
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
four um depending on the experience and
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
the qualifications of the candidates
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
before us and so we always strive to
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
hire the most capable competent um
 
05:28:48.750 --> 05:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
experienced educated staff that we're
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
able to and our hope would be that um
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know we would be able to find those
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
candidates additionally
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we we're finding we're having
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
candidates coming with uh more
 
05:29:04.750 --> 05:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
experience uh more life experienced um
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
it's less frequent that we're finding um
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
out of college you know fresh out of
 
05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
college um candidates and so we're
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
needing to be um a Workforce that
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
attracts our seasoned experienced um
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
potential Workforce and so we need to
 
05:29:22.510 --> 05:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
have the levels one through four
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
available for
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
hiring and and can you speak to the
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
staff Attorneys at level two again step
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
five I think it would be the same it
 
05:29:34.390 --> 05:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
would be the same in terms of I can't
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
speak to whether we're getting more
 
05:29:38.190 --> 05:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
seasoned um experienced attorneys but
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're capable of hiring up through our
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
top level of attorney and we would want
 
05:29:44.190 --> 05:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
to have that available um in these
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
instances as well
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
so is there any intent to promote within
 
05:29:52.230 --> 05:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
the department to these higher level
 
05:29:53.948 --> 05:29:53.958 align:start position:0%
positions and then
 
05:29:56.190 --> 05:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
backfill no that would not be Our
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
intention okay uh one last question
 
05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
right now who advocates for the child in
 
05:30:05.670 --> 05:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
the in this process today so currently
 
05:30:07.590 --> 05:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
each child is uh appointed a guardian
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
edl or aasa and those are the entities
 
05:30:12.750 --> 05:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
that currently advocate for the best
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
interests of the
 
05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
child okay versus best expressed
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
interests versus the child's expressed
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
interests yes thank
 
05:30:25.150 --> 05:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you anything further okay
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
we're all set oh representative walner
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so almost every time we come
 
05:30:34.270 --> 05:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
in this room we talk about reducing the
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
number of children who are in
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
05:30:41.190 --> 05:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
and I know the department has a lot of
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives to uh work on that and to
 
05:30:46.948 --> 05:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
reduce them what what do you see in the
 
05:30:46.958 --> 05:30:47.830 align:start position:0%
reduce them what what do you see in the
near

05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
near
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
future of how many children do you think
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
we might be able to bring back into the
 
05:30:57.868 --> 05:30:57.878 align:start position:0%
community and to Foster families and fam
 
05:31:01.110 --> 05:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
their kin um because as as we bring
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
those children back into those
 
05:31:07.948 --> 05:31:07.958 align:start position:0%
settings this this won't be as necessary
 
05:31:10.110 --> 05:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
there won't be as many of these children
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
sure one yeah that's true um and it
 
05:31:15.430 --> 05:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the shell but not
 
05:31:17.470 --> 05:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily the May in terms of children
 
05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
that may Express an interest to have an
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
attorney so that that is a true
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
statement um I would be hesitant to
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
provide a number of of children that
 
05:31:28.510 --> 05:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're actively working on but I can
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
share with you that we are certainly
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking at ensuring that our community
 
05:31:36.110 --> 05:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
based care is expanded is stood up um
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
has the workforce that it needs to be
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
able to provide the preventative
 
05:31:41.350 --> 05:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
Services to prevent children from being
 
05:31:43.948 --> 05:31:43.958 align:start position:0%
in residential treatment to begin with
 
05:31:45.868 --> 05:31:45.878 align:start position:0%
um so we've got lots of efforts in the
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
preventative realm as well as looking at
 
05:31:50.788 --> 05:31:50.798 align:start position:0%
our current service array to ensure that
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
if we were to step children down from
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
residential treatment to Community Based
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
care that we have an array of services
 
05:31:57.868 --> 05:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
available for
 
05:32:01.150 --> 05:32:01.160 align:start position:0%

and family law committee did a lot of
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
work on that bill tried to explore ways
 
05:32:54.430 --> 05:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
to bring down the fiscal note to Target
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh Council for kids to um abuse and
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
neglect cases I believe that Bill had
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
had initially had an expanded right to
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
all family cases so this this one does
 
05:33:06.430 --> 05:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
narrow that field um and we did a lot of
 
05:33:09.030 --> 05:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
work in child and family law this where
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
535 ended up passing out of committee um
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
I think it was 14 to1 there was there
 
05:33:19.150 --> 05:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
was one um opposition and then um and
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
then SB 463 is sort of the parallel View
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
and The Advocates that have worked on
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
this Initiative for years really see
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
this as um an even improved version of
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
that bill it really brings in sort of
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
the interplay between attorneys and
 
05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
Casas which we think is um important to
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
really outline the role caas and sort of
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
the the value added of attorneys without
 
05:33:42.910 --> 05:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
minimizing that role so we think that
 
05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
that initial Preamble is really
 
05:33:46.750 --> 05:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
important in this bill um and then it
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
also adds some clarification around the
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
language of when council is appointed so
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
we really think that this is a gold
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
standard bill it passed out of um the
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
Senate policy committee I believe
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
unanimously um same thing here in the
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
house we think that this has been well
 
05:34:04.868 --> 05:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
vetted in terms of the policy and we're
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
really excited about this opportunity um
 
05:34:08.830 --> 05:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
a couple things that it does is it
 
05:34:10.430 --> 05:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
brings New Hampshire in line with some
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
national nationally recognized best
 
05:34:14.350 --> 05:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
practices currently New Hampshire is
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
only one of 13 states in the country
 
05:34:18.750 --> 05:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
that don't guarantee a child a right to
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
express interest counsel and it's only
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
one of six C Six States in the country
 
05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
that never guarantees a child a right to
 
05:34:29.390 --> 05:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
counsel currently in New Hampshire um
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
children only are able to have counsel
 
05:34:34.510 --> 05:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
if they have an Express disagreement
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
with their um with their CA so their
 
05:34:40.230 --> 05:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
their best interest advocate in the
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
court system so if they have a
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
disagreement with their CA and the ca
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
brings that to the court the court then
 
05:34:49.548 --> 05:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
may appoint an attorney there is
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely no provision in law that will
 
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
ever guarantee a right to children in
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
these proceedings an attorney yet what
 
05:35:02.350 --> 05:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
we know is that there are currently 124
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
youth um in abuse and neglect cases um
 
05:35:07.470 --> 05:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
according to information just provided
 
05:35:09.868 --> 05:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
by the off Office of the child advocate
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
who are currently in institutional
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
settings um removed not just from their
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
families um not just from their
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
communities but are placed in
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
institutions in group care where they
 
05:35:26.470 --> 05:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
are with staff not families that love
 
05:35:28.910 --> 05:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
them not families that could love them
 
05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
someday and care for them forever but in
 
05:35:34.628 --> 05:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
institutional settings which is akin to
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
where kids who have been charged with
 
05:35:39.310 --> 05:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
delinquency k delinquent in delinquency
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
cases and are institutionalized are
 
05:35:44.030 --> 05:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
placed these are children who have not
 
05:35:46.350 --> 05:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
committed crimes but who have been
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
abused by their families and there have
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
been findings of abuse against them and
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
they are in institutional settings so
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the years we've been working
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill we really try to narrow in
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
on that population of Youth to ensure
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
that those kids who are the most in need
 
05:36:08.670 --> 05:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
are targeted for these limited resources
 
05:36:10.990 --> 05:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we know the state has we think best
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
practice would be to provide all youth
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
in care um the right to an attorney but
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill does because
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
we attempted to very narrowly Target it
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
to use our resources as well um so it
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
does two things it allows um judges in
 
05:36:30.670 --> 05:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
complicated cases to appoint Council to
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
kids if they deem it necessary so it
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
expands the discretionary right to
 
05:36:37.868 --> 05:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
counsel to not just um allow Court to
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel if there's a
 
05:36:41.070 --> 05:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
disagreement between a child and their
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Casa um at the dispositional hearing so
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's also that temporal Lim
 
05:36:48.110 --> 05:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
limitation currently but if there's a
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
particularly complex case where a where
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
a judge believes that a child could
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from counsil it it gives the
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
judge that Latitude to do that we think
 
05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
that that probably could happen in a um
 
05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
in a narrow category of cases I know
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
that I've been I'm an attorney who rep
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
who um represents kids in a variety of
 
05:37:09.788 --> 05:37:09.798 align:start position:0%
different settings um and I've been um
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
contacted by Casas who really believe
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
that a child could benefit from
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
additional legal support and they just
 
05:37:19.670 --> 05:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they have that support
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
um they there are attorneys within the
 
05:37:24.948 --> 05:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
office um that that you know that's
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
limited they can't do it in every single
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
case and so this would when those
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys aren't available it would give
 
05:37:32.868 --> 05:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
the judge the latitude to do that that's
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say um the second
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
category of children who would be enti
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
to counsel are children who are either
 
05:37:43.110 --> 05:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
in or at risk of institutional placement
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
and we like this bill because it defines
 
05:37:47.470 --> 05:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
very clearly what it means for a child
 
05:37:50.110 --> 05:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
to be at risk of institutional placement
 
05:37:51.430 --> 05:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
I think you heard from the Department
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
just now that one of the additional
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
duties that would be imposed on Child
 
05:37:56.430 --> 05:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
Protection soal protective social
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
workers is to provide an assessment to
 
05:38:00.430 --> 05:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
determine when a child requires
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
placement but what's confusing I think
 
05:38:04.390 --> 05:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
about that representation is that
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
there's already a very robust process in
 
05:38:10.708 --> 05:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
place to determine when a child is at
 
05:38:13.390 --> 05:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
risk of institutional placement So
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently um under the family's First
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
Act and then written into dcyf policy
 
05:38:21.548 --> 05:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
when DCF is recommending a child for
 
05:38:24.070 --> 05:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
institutional or group CARE um they have
 
05:38:25.948 --> 05:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
to refer a child to what's called a cat
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
assessment it's a comprehensive
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
assessment for treatment and that cat
 
05:38:31.548 --> 05:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
assessment then assesses the child it
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
communicates with the family it
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
communicates with the social workers and
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
it might communicate with providers to
 
05:38:39.230 --> 05:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
determine what level of care a child
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
needs so what this bill is it ties the
 
05:38:45.230 --> 05:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
atrisk determination to that process
 
05:38:48.468 --> 05:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
that already exists it does not add
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
another layer of assessment it a it says
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
L quite literally that when a CH when
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
when dcyf either sends a packet of
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
information to an Institutional setting
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
or refers the child for a cat assessment
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
the child is then deemed at risk and
 
05:39:08.310 --> 05:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
they must simply notify the court um
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
that that they have initiated that
 
05:39:12.510 --> 05:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
process and that the child should be
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
appointed an attorney we do not think
 
05:39:18.788 --> 05:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
that that would require one cpsw much
 
05:39:18.798 --> 05:39:19.548 align:start position:0%
that that would require one cpsw much
less

05:39:19.548 --> 05:39:19.558 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
14 um the the second uh the the second
 
05:39:26.750 --> 05:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
piece that I heard that that DCF may
 
05:39:29.948 --> 05:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
need to do is inform the child of their
 
05:39:33.310 --> 05:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
right um to council but what this bill
 
05:39:36.310 --> 05:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
does it is it just adds it to one of
 
05:39:38.590 --> 05:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
many rights within the Foster youth Bill
 
05:39:40.590 --> 05:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
of Rights so when a child is removed
 
05:39:42.510 --> 05:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
from their home and only when a child is
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
removed from their home um they must be
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
read the the Foster youth Bill of Rights
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
and they must be informed of their
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
rights and how to exercise those rights
 
05:39:54.468 --> 05:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
I think there are 23 rights um including
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know the right to familial
 
05:39:57.510 --> 05:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
Association the right to continue
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
contact with their siblings just many
 
05:40:02.670 --> 05:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
good rights so in that form that is
 
05:40:04.590 --> 05:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
already provided to the child they will
 
05:40:06.270 --> 05:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
have to do they will have to include one
 
05:40:08.350 --> 05:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
additional right that is they have the
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
right to have councel if they are in an
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
Institutional placement or referred to
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
an Institutional placement um or they
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
have a right to request councel and then
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
it must just say set forth um the
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
process for doing so so if DCF or the
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
courts or whoever determines that the
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
process to request councel is to write a
 
05:40:30.750 --> 05:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
letter to the court it just says you can
 
05:40:32.590 --> 05:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
request Council by writing a letter to
 
05:40:35.230 --> 05:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
the court so it require this bill
 
05:40:37.270 --> 05:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
requires nothing more than that to tell
 
05:40:38.670 --> 05:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
tell the child they have a right to
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
request counsel and how to do that again
 
05:40:45.390 --> 05:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
we don't think that requires one cpsw
 
05:40:47.310 --> 05:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
much less 14
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
cpsws um in terms of the additional
 
05:40:54.670 --> 05:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
workload placed upon um dcyf lawyers if
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
there are additional
 
05:41:00.230 --> 05:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
counsel of course I'm a lawyer that
 
05:41:02.910 --> 05:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
could happen um that is that could be
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
real whether they need five I don't know
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note for this Bill
 
05:41:10.270 --> 05:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
did have um the fiscal note for the five
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys you know if if that's
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
something that this committee is is um
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
willing to look at I think that that
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
might you know they may need that I
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
think that even that number is inflated
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
but what I'm so worried about with this
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill is I think it is yet another really
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
really strong policy that has been well
 
05:41:33.468 --> 05:41:33.478 align:start position:0%
vetted um narrowly tailored and is at
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
risk of not passing Finance because of
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
what we believe is a incredibly INF
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
inflated fiscal note not now not for
 
05:41:43.270 --> 05:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
this session because there is no fiscal
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
impact this session um but in the future
 
05:41:48.190 --> 05:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
and so what we what we kind of like
 
05:41:50.430 --> 05:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
about how the fiscal Noe is working
 
05:41:52.590 --> 05:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
right now is that um we think that the
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
policy should pass and a lot of these
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
issues could then play out through the
 
05:42:01.270 --> 05:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
budget process um and and and I think
 
05:42:02.750 --> 05:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
there would be time to do that to really
 
05:42:06.310 --> 05:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
V you know what of of these bills that
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
involve dcy which ones do pass and what
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
of these responsibilities and these um
 
05:42:12.430 --> 05:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
requests that they're asking for could
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
be combined and we think that that's
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
something that could be done in the next
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
bium but wouldn't want good policy not
 
05:42:21.948 --> 05:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
to pass because there's a question about
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
how big the the fiscal note could be
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
down the road um when we just don't
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
think there are there's there are duties
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill that that require that level
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
of work on the Department's side one
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
thing I did do is I the fiscal note for
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
on the judicial Council side um
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
indicated that of the very few attorneys
 
05:42:47.788 --> 05:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
that have been appointed in these cases
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
the average cost um per case is $
 
05:42:51.840 --> 05:42:53.590 align:start position:0%
the average cost um per case is $
1,02

05:42:53.590 --> 05:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
1,02
 
05:42:56.190 --> 05:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
$12 so I just did some math so I know
 
05:42:57.910 --> 05:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
from the from the office of the child
 
05:43:00.628 --> 05:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
advocate that um currently there are1
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
1224 kids in care so um in institutional
 
05:43:07.628 --> 05:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
placements so say we double that and get
 
05:43:10.510 --> 05:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know 250 and say because we know
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a frontload of
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys and then kids will trickle in
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so we double that we
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
add a little bit say 300 so say there's
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
300 kids over the course of the year who
 
05:43:23.708 --> 05:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
need counsel uh if we take the average
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
cost per case right now of what the
 
05:43:28.270 --> 05:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
judicial council is paying that's
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
3,600 for the council for the children
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
and yet what we have is a fiscal note
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
for the Department two years down the
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
road that's 1 million5
 
05:43:40.670 --> 05:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
$500,000 as opposed to the cost of
 
05:43:44.590 --> 05:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
council for kids roughly
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
$300,000 that's concerning this is good
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
policy that is at risk because of an
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
inflated fiscal note this is the fiscal
 
05:43:56.548 --> 05:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy to answer any policy
 
05:43:58.310 --> 05:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions I've thought about this a lot
 
05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
through the years but please focus on
 
05:44:04.190 --> 05:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
the reasonable a reasonable fiscal note
 
05:44:07.468 --> 05:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
and ask questions of the department
 
05:44:09.270 --> 05:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
these questions of the department which
 
05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
I know the committee has been doing but
 
05:44:12.670 --> 05:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to continue committing
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
and not let this fiscal note kill good
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
policy happy to ask answer any
 
05:44:22.708 --> 05:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that any
 
05:44:25.150 --> 05:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
comments okay I think we're all set but
 
05:44:30.430 --> 05:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I think an
 
05:44:32.830 --> 05:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
amendment will likely be proposed on
 
05:44:32.840 --> 05:44:33.628 align:start position:0%
amendment will likely be proposed on
this

05:44:33.628 --> 05:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:44:37.390 --> 05:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
bill um is someone going to request that
 
05:44:39.390 --> 05:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
or um I
 
05:44:41.788 --> 05:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
could um start drafting it
 
05:44:41.798 --> 05:44:45.190 align:start position:0%
could um start drafting it
representative

05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.200 --> 05:44:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
priest

05:44:47.150 --> 05:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
priest
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.350 --> 05:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
good I think there's enough to go on
 
05:44:55.390 --> 05:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
there to craft an amendment uh anyone
 
05:44:59.230 --> 05:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
else on Senate Bill 463 yes from the
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
hello Aon krian general counsel for the
 
05:45:13.628 --> 05:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh to your financial
 
05:45:16.030 --> 05:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
question we did complete a fiscal note
 
05:45:18.910 --> 05:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
on HB uh 535 which is the house
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
companion uh so I compliment the house
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
on having asked us for a fiscal note uh
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's too bad that the Senate was not as
 
05:45:29.110 --> 05:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
diligent as Mr Ripple uh but but it it
 
05:45:31.548 --> 05:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
was relatively low uh it's a little
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
difficult to estimate for us the cost
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
because we are having these hearings and
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
these proceedings already presumably the
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to increase the time
 
05:45:39.230 --> 05:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
because that's what they're there to do
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're there to bring additional
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
arguments on behalf of the child so our
 
05:45:45.070 --> 05:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
estimate was in each of these let's say
 
05:45:48.030 --> 05:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
about 130 cases that if it was only
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
about a half hour of additional
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
arguments a year that might be low but
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
let's just say that it was about $40,000
 
05:45:58.030 --> 05:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
in cost I wouldn't there probably are
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
some additional costs you're
 
05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
rescheduling because of attorneys you
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
have longer arguments but the costs are
 
05:46:04.990 --> 05:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
not as high for us as they probably are
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
for the judicial Council I don't believe
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
anyone from judicial Council made it so
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
I I will say uh that the the previous
 
05:46:14.350 --> 05:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
witness is is probably right in her
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
estimate they they provided a very good
 
05:46:18.590 --> 05:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
um write up for the fiscal note on how
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
they estimate the cost and I think it it
 
05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
probably would be somewhere around
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
$300,000 if I'm guessing so between us
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
and them maybe
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
$350,000 or
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
so one thing I did put in that fiscal
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
note on on HB uh 535 which is not a
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
strictly a fiscal question but a
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
question that potentially increased
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
costs and and is one question that has
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
been a little open-ended for us is this
 
05:46:48.390 --> 05:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill and HP 535 have progressed which is
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
that um we we do have a shortage of
 
05:46:52.750 --> 05:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys in New Hampshire unfortunately
 
05:46:54.910 --> 05:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are many Creative Solutions
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we've come up with uh we have
 
05:46:58.110 --> 05:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
police prosecutors or are sometimes non-
 
05:46:59.948 --> 05:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys we have a par professional
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
program which is being reauthorized
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
where um par professionals can represent
 
05:47:06.590 --> 05:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
people in court in certain cases uh the
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
the pools of attorneys that potentially
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
we would draw on for these mandatory
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
appointments are potentially those that
 
05:47:13.868 --> 05:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
are representing children in delinquency
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
cases and those that are representing
 
05:47:17.788 --> 05:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
parents in their mandatory appointment
 
05:47:19.390 --> 05:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
cases such as abuse and neglect and
 
05:47:21.868 --> 05:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
termination cases those pools are very
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
small they're very thin we're getting
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
very close to situations where we don't
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
have someone someday for for our
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
existing statutory obligations and I
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
know that there is a very committed
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
group of Advocates many of them here in
 
05:47:35.390 --> 05:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
the room that are working on bringing
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
new people into the fold to take these
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
appointments particularly for children
 
05:47:41.830 --> 05:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that it is all of our strong hope
 
05:47:43.948 --> 05:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
that um should this mandatory
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
appointment uh come to pass that we have
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
the attorneys to fulfill it but I have
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly had judges ask me what they
 
05:47:53.430 --> 05:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
should do if there isn't an attorney
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
available and I think I know what would
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
happen which is there'd be delay and
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
there'd be upset in the case and then
 
05:48:01.350 --> 05:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
eventually they'd have to proceed um but
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
if the legislature is envisioning a
 
05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
different uh result in that case it
 
05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
would just be helpful to have that
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
guidance because the judges would prefer
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
to do what you have determined is the
 
05:48:11.468 --> 05:48:11.478 align:start position:0%
right thing to do in that situation
 
05:48:14.270 --> 05:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
rather than ad hoc potentially different
 
05:48:15.750 --> 05:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially not what you were
 
05:48:17.230 --> 05:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
intending to have happen in that
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance so that is the only
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
implementation question that I have as I
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
read the bill otherwise it is a policy
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
judgment and we have the ability to
 
05:48:25.680 --> 05:48:27.310 align:start position:0%
judgment and we have the ability to
implement

05:48:27.310 --> 05:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
implement
 
05:48:31.150 --> 05:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much any thoughts or
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions okay all helpful information
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
for the priest amendment that we all
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you anything further Senate Bill
 
05:48:40.160 --> 05:48:41.948 align:start position:0%
thank you anything further Senate Bill

05:48:41.948 --> 05:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
463
 
05:48:44.510 --> 05:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
yes Miss
 
05:48:48.670 --> 05:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
masso that was very close maio maio very
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
good Lista masio associate child
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
advocate um I just want to say how
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
strongly the office of child advocate
 
05:48:57.150 --> 05:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
supports this bill we have also been
 
05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
part of uh those working groups that
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
attorney wangerin mentioned starting
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
last fall on children and family working
 
05:49:06.468 --> 05:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
all through this session um we have been
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
CL collaborating with The Advocates with
 
05:49:10.350 --> 05:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
the Department with the
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
Judiciary this bill um does relate in
 
05:49:16.230 --> 05:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
part to our bledo uh report that I've
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
spoken about the two children there in
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
Tennessee did not have
 
05:49:22.788 --> 05:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
attorneys the outcome may have been
 
05:49:26.110 --> 05:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
better for them had they had attorneys
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'll go backwards as far as
 
05:49:31.670 --> 05:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
implementation um I do sit on a number
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
of other committees and working groups
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
they are recruiting more attorneys both
 
05:49:38.190 --> 05:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
for parent par and with the anticipation
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
that these children's attorneys are
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
coming both because of the legislation
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's been pending but also the
 
05:49:45.910 --> 05:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
judicial Council just a week or so ago
 
05:49:47.868 --> 05:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
approved standards for children's
 
05:49:49.390 --> 05:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys which has been a work in
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
progress for a couple of years so the
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch at least is anticipating
 
05:49:56.670 --> 05:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
this is happening they've created
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
standards um Lisa Wilford who I I don't
 
05:50:01.270 --> 05:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
believe could make it today she is the
 
05:50:03.070 --> 05:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
executive director of the children's Law
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
Center a nonprofit that provides Council
 
05:50:08.910 --> 05:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
for children in a variety of these cases
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
has been working closely with a number
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
of people including the judicial Council
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
and model Court to create trainings for
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
children's attorneys um as I mentioned
 
05:50:20.190 --> 05:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
earlier I was a parent attorney for many
 
05:50:22.110 --> 05:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
years when I was in private practice it
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
is a thin pool but it's a growing pool
 
05:50:26.110 --> 05:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
and those that serve in that pool are
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
extremely dedicated I have no doubt that
 
05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
the people that serve as parents
 
05:50:31.708 --> 05:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys may also pick up children's
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
cases I can tell you when I was a
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
parents attorney I was living in The
 
05:50:38.070 --> 05:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region I I would drive to Berlin
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
to Littleton to Keane to take cases this
 
05:50:42.910 --> 05:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
is a pool of people that are very
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated and I have no doubt that um
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
folks who want to help children who are
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
currently helping children in the
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice Arena and other Arenas
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
would happily Step Up um I would support
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
everything that attorney wangerin said
 
05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
as far as the questions about Staffing
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh that you chairwoman Mooney asked they
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
do seem a little out of line with what
 
05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
is required in this bill um
 
05:51:09.868 --> 05:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
there's always balancing of workloads
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
and case loads um nothing in this bill
 
05:51:14.670 --> 05:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
appears to create a massive amount of
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
work for
 
05:51:17.948 --> 05:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
cpsws I can tell you as a parent
 
05:51:22.910 --> 05:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
attorney I filed maybe three motions um
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a ton of motion practice in
 
05:51:27.310 --> 05:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
this area much of what happens happens
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
at the existing hearings they are
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
happening every three months it's not
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
like it's going a year um so a lot of
 
05:51:35.948 --> 05:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
the work happens right at a hearing um
 
05:51:39.190 --> 05:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know is some minor motions practice
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
but generally you know I don't believe
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
it would add a ton of attorney time for
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
dcyf it's already an ongoing case um as
 
05:51:49.910 --> 05:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
far as the records that Miss Nunan
 
05:51:52.590 --> 05:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned this does give a right to a
 
05:51:54.750 --> 05:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
newly appointed children's attorney to
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
view and copy um there already is a
 
05:51:59.910 --> 05:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
pretty robust uh Discovery process in
 
05:52:02.070 --> 05:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
DCF cases the attorneys are actually
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
involved in that process you know there
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
are case
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
AIDS unfortunately there's actually not
 
05:52:09.788 --> 05:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
a ton of paperwork around children in
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
these cases there's not probably a lot
 
05:52:14.230 --> 05:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
of paperwork involved but would it
 
05:52:15.788 --> 05:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
include 14
 
05:52:18.548 --> 05:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
cpsws probably not there are case AIDS
 
05:52:20.468 --> 05:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
and lower level folks that already exist
 
05:52:22.670 --> 05:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
that could help with copying records if
 
05:52:26.468 --> 05:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
necessary um but generally the policy
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
here is strong um as mentioned this has
 
05:52:31.788 --> 05:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
been very narrowly tailored it is a
 
05:52:34.750 --> 05:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
population currently of only about 124
 
05:52:36.910 --> 05:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
kids that are in open child protection
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
cases that are in residential placement
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
the other number of children that I
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Believe Miss Nan mentioned child uh
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice kids already have
 
05:52:49.590 --> 05:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys so the other out of that group
 
05:52:51.150 --> 05:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
already have attorneys appointed to them
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's only the child protection kids that
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
do not have an attorney um so generally
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
speaking this this bill has really been
 
05:53:01.990 --> 05:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
worked on for a very long time with an
 
05:53:04.590 --> 05:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
outcome that I think is is very narrow
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
but helps a very vulnerable population
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
of children that are don't have a lot of
 
05:53:13.468 --> 05:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
independent eyes on them that do are you
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
know separated from their families and
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
their communities and you know the
 
05:53:19.628 --> 05:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate spends a bit of
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
our time visiting these kids in
 
05:53:22.990 --> 05:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
residential placements both in New
 
05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New England and even
 
05:53:26.830 --> 05:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state to to visit kids
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
like the kids at bledo in Tennessee and
 
05:53:32.310 --> 05:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
these are some of our most vulnerable
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
children and they need as many voices as
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
possible nakasa is an important voice um
 
05:53:40.628 --> 05:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
they're also Limited in what they can do
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
and uh they are not attorneys they are
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
not filing motions normally they are
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
representing what they believe is in
 
05:53:49.070 --> 05:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
that child's best interest they are not
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
representing that child's expressed
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
interest so I'm happy to take any
 
05:53:56.750 --> 05:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh we do feel like this is
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
really important policy to move forward
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
the other important policies we've
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
talked about today of keeping children
 
05:54:05.070 --> 05:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
with their families in their communities
 
05:54:07.230 --> 05:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
limiting that residential placement
 
05:54:09.708 --> 05:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
short as time as possible as narrow as
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
possible and attorneys can help in that
 
05:54:12.040 --> 05:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
possible and attorneys can help in that
I

05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:17.070 --> 05:54:17.080 align:start position:0%

05:54:24.868 --> 05:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
has to be straightened out here with
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%

05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner at the Department
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services hopefully I
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
will help you make up some time um we
 
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
just have a few comments on this bill
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me t i l l y thank you you're
 
05:56:51.150 --> 05:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
welcome so this bill places the
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
department in a pickle is the uh
 
05:56:55.270 --> 05:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
technical term I will use for this it
 
05:56:57.468 --> 05:56:57.478 align:start position:0%
directs the department to step outside
 
05:56:59.430 --> 05:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
of its current role to address what
 
05:57:01.190 --> 05:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
actions would be needed to be put in
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
place to protect and expand access to
 
05:57:05.948 --> 05:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
these medications that the department
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
does not control on top of that it
 
05:57:10.750 --> 05:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
states that no General funds and no
 
05:57:12.910 --> 05:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
existing federal funds appropriated the
 
05:57:15.510 --> 05:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
department can be used to meet the
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
requirements of the bill or I I'll
 
05:57:20.430 --> 05:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
reframe that no General funds and does
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
not specify around federal funds it
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
directs the department to seek or apply
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
for um the appropriate grants or federal
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
funds um to complete the report but we
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
know of No Such funding source that
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
would could be used for this purpose um
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
I will also note that even if we did
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
know of a potential funding source it's
 
05:57:45.390 --> 05:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
unclear just technically if we could get
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
those funds um included within our
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
budget through our joint legislative
 
05:57:52.910 --> 05:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee as well as governor and
 
05:57:55.948 --> 05:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
councel given the topic um it's
 
05:57:58.150 --> 05:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
important to note that the department
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
does not collect any data at this time
 
05:58:03.548 --> 05:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
regarding abortion or abortion
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
medications um and many of our federal
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
fund funding sources such as the title
 
05:58:10.510 --> 05:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
10 Family Planning program limits the
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department's capacity to even address
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
issues of abortion um so I will stop
 
05:58:19.468 --> 05:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
there I'm happy to take questions the
 
05:58:20.990 --> 05:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
department the bill requires the
 
05:58:22.990 --> 05:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
department to write a report for things
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't typically manage and it's
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
unclear the funding source we would use
 
05:58:29.390 --> 05:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you uh just to draw
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
your attention to the fiscal note we are
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
looking and working off of the fiscal
 
05:58:36.548 --> 05:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
note dated April 2nd 2024 and it looks
 
05:58:39.310 --> 05:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
like um a total fiscal impact of less
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
than $10,000 that's from General
 
05:58:46.270 --> 05:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
funds that's correct and that was
 
05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
um based on a conversation I had with
 
05:58:50.750 --> 05:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
the Department stating that the Bill's
 
05:58:52.430 --> 05:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
requirements would uh reflect
 
05:58:54.270 --> 05:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 5% of the cost of a
 
05:58:55.990 --> 05:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent position so that's
 
05:58:58.670 --> 05:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
how we arrived at the under 10k
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
figure okay and I notice it does not
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
appear on the appropriation bills list
 
05:59:05.070 --> 05:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
so just to draw the attention there okay
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to go representative priest
 
05:59:09.468 --> 05:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
representative hle representative
 
05:59:11.670 --> 05:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Madame chairman for
 
05:59:13.230 --> 05:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
being here
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
um currently you are not doing this is
 
05:59:22.990 --> 05:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct and is the
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
act or the the value of the individual's
 
05:59:31.868 --> 05:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
privacy a big factor of why you're not
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
doing this if you are asking as to why
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
we are not collecting abortion related
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
data privacy is certainly Paramount and
 
05:59:41.788 --> 05:59:41.798 align:start position:0%
that has been a a question that has been
 
05:59:43.310 --> 05:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
considered by the general court quite
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
frankly for more than a decade I've been
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
around a long time and pretty much every
 
05:59:50.190 --> 05:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
bium we have a conversation around
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
abortion related statistics privacy is
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
always an issue cost is always an
 
05:59:59.788 --> 05:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
issue followup as a followup the cost is
 
06:00:04.510 --> 06:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
very minimal and so I would say privacy
 
06:00:07.430 --> 06:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the fact
 
06:00:10.990 --> 06:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
that there really isn't a need to to get
 
06:00:11.000 --> 06:00:12.230 align:start position:0%
that there really isn't a need to to get
this

06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
information to have this
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
information I'm not sure if there's a
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
question there I there isn't I guess you
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hle thank you
 
06:00:24.190 --> 06:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair are you doing something
 
06:00:27.788 --> 06:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
similar for any other um either off the
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
shelf or prescription medication this
 
06:00:32.590 --> 06:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
type of repor this this is a great
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
question I mean so if we were to compare
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
this to say Di IES medicine we if we
 
06:00:40.750 --> 06:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
knew that there were medications that
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations were not able to
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
access that would that might be
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
something that we would be interested in
 
06:00:48.468 --> 06:00:48.478 align:start position:0%
doing and quite frankly we would
 
06:00:50.868 --> 06:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
probably have a federal funding source
 
06:00:52.310 --> 06:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether it is through Medicaid or
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
through some Hera or CDC funds that we
 
06:00:57.548 --> 06:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
would be able to explore that idea the
 
06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
these particular medications as I said
 
06:01:01.310 --> 06:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
just put us in a pickle because we are
 
06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
typically not in the business of
 
06:01:07.788 --> 06:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
providing them thank you represent ative
 
06:01:10.990 --> 06:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
tarki thank you I was just um the
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
comments about privacy I don't actually
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
see how that pertains to this bill at
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
all um it correct it I was responding to
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
why we don't collect abortion statistics
 
06:01:23.468 --> 06:01:23.478 align:start position:0%
in terms of privacy for this bill this
 
06:01:26.830 --> 06:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
is a policy question around access and
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
um barriers to access for two particular
 
06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
medications okay and so there would not
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
be necessarily a privacy issue here but
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
again the pickle that we are in is that
 
06:01:38.670 --> 06:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have a particular uh program
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
that would be funded to do this we don't
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
have a particular um uh funding source
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
that would do it and it's outside the
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
scope of what we typically do as Mr
 
06:01:49.830 --> 06:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
Ripple noted it's not a heavy lift it
 
06:01:51.548 --> 06:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
just puts us in a pickle to figure out
 
06:01:54.430 --> 06:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
how to do that representative Lon then
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative priest then
 
06:01:57.708 --> 06:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
representative walner um thank you madam
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
chair um in testimony in the Health and
 
06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee there was some
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about how if the FDA approval
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
was reversed um like we've seen with
 
06:02:09.628 --> 06:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
some cold medicines how the state would
 
06:02:12.350 --> 06:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
ensure access to this um my question is
 
06:02:15.310 --> 06:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
if the department is in the business of
 
06:02:17.350 --> 06:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
um providing access to medications that
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
are not um permitted under the FDA
 
06:02:22.590 --> 06:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
typically not I I think that would be
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
the answer I mean we would look at
 
06:02:27.310 --> 06:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
through um again if I were to talk about
 
06:02:29.150 --> 06:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
diabetes medication or hypertension
 
06:02:31.190 --> 06:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
medication we would want to ensure that
 
06:02:33.430 --> 06:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
care is getting to um patients
 
06:02:34.708 --> 06:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
especially within the Medicaid
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
population or low in or vulnerable
 
06:02:39.070 --> 06:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
populations that we typically have
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
public health concerns around a
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up question followup um as a
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
followup if the FDA um was um stopped
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
allowing access to these or any other
 
06:02:50.670 --> 06:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
medications would it put the department
 
06:02:53.548 --> 06:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
in a difficult position of trying to go
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
against federal policy um by a mandate
 
06:02:58.868 --> 06:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
from the state um thank you for that
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
question you know I would have to think
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
about that a little more the way that I
 
06:03:04.110 --> 06:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
read this is really a report about
 
06:03:07.390 --> 06:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
access and how we would do Outreach and
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
um address barriers so I don't know that
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
we would be in a particular uh where
 
06:03:14.350 --> 06:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
that would Place Us in terms of FDA I
 
06:03:16.430 --> 06:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
think we would simply need to state that
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
if the FDA took away um their approval
 
06:03:22.270 --> 06:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
for this you know it would mean XYZ for
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
the population thank you representative
 
06:03:26.910 --> 06:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
priest then representative walner thank
 
06:03:28.510 --> 06:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman and thank you for
 
06:03:32.670 --> 06:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question what programs do you
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
currently have in providing
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh women um with limited
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
income information about birth control
 
06:03:43.878 --> 06:03:44.830 align:start position:0%
income information about birth control
Health

06:03:44.830 --> 06:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
Health
 
06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
practices availability to this
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
medication sure thank you so I will take
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
that in two parts you asked uh initially
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
what programs does the department have
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
around reproductive Health generally I
 
06:03:58.990 --> 06:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll sum Summit that way well we
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
have our family planning program which
 
06:04:03.230 --> 06:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
is a federally funded title 10 we use
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
some general funds to provide family
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
planning which is really focused on
 
06:04:10.110 --> 06:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health primary care
 
06:04:12.430 --> 06:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
preventative care and contraception it
 
06:04:15.150 --> 06:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
does not include abortion um our family
 
06:04:16.670 --> 06:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
planning program does not pay for
 
06:04:18.788 --> 06:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
abortion we are federally and we have
 
06:04:20.990 --> 06:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
both federal and state law that um
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
prohibits abortion as a part of that
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
program it is a Comprehensive Health
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
women representative
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
walner thank you
 
06:04:40.070 --> 06:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
if um if there was an appropriation on
 
06:04:42.868 --> 06:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of
 
06:04:45.270 --> 06:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is it possible for the
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
Department to contract out the writing
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
of and the developing of this report so
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't fall to the
 
06:04:56.788 --> 06:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
department sure I I that's certainly
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
something we would likely consider again
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
there are some probably things we would
 
06:05:02.468 --> 06:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
have to think about at the end of the
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
day um the political considerations of
 
06:05:07.390 --> 06:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
that if that contract um would be
 
06:05:10.110 --> 06:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
supported by um the executive Council
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
but that would be a mechanism that we
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
could think about using in order to
 
06:05:19.390 --> 06:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
complete uh the requirements of of this
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
reporting followup can you think do
 
06:05:26.948 --> 06:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
you can you think of any contractors
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
that might be available to do this kind
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
of work there certainly could be you
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
know I think there are Health policy um
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
you know vendors out there who could do
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
that or academic folks that might be
 
06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
interested there certainly probably are
 
06:05:43.350 --> 06:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
um a population of appropriate folks
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
that could write this thank
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
you representative tarki thank you I
 
06:05:52.948 --> 06:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
guess I just W to get a clarification on
 
06:05:54.990 --> 06:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
something um it's my understanding these
 
06:05:59.788 --> 06:05:59.798 align:start position:0%
drugs are not used solely for
 
06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
abortions but are also used in cases of
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
medical crisis where a pregnancy
 
06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
um fails yes
 
06:06:14.590 --> 06:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
um would there be any benefit
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
to doing what is um in this bill to
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
ensure that the medication is still
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
available in those
 
06:06:24.430 --> 06:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
situations thank you that's a great
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
question and I think we would highlight
 
06:06:28.350 --> 06:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
that in any report they are primarily
 
06:06:31.708 --> 06:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
used for early term abortion right now
 
06:06:33.788 --> 06:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
but that is not the sole reason that
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
those these um particular ular
 
06:06:38.030 --> 06:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
medications are used and are authorized
 
06:06:40.390 --> 06:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
for use there are even things Beyond
 
06:06:43.150 --> 06:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
termination or even looking at at
 
06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
somehow um if you have a a pregnancy
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
that is in trouble um so there are other
 
06:06:50.190 --> 06:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
areas in which these medications are
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
used I think it's probably the safest
 
06:06:54.990 --> 06:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
way to answer your question that well
 
06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
that's what I was saying so I guess
 
06:06:59.190 --> 06:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
throwing out the you know the baby with
 
06:07:01.390 --> 06:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
the bath water in terms of you know we
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
you don't address that issue I guess I'm
 
06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
just wondering the medical um you know
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
use of these drugs sure and I I don't
 
06:07:10.350 --> 06:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
know the prevalence of how they're used
 
06:07:11.788 --> 06:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
I mean that's one of the things we don't
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
collect data on right now so I don't
 
06:07:16.110 --> 06:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
know the prevalence to say how you know
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
what big of an impact that would be in
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I certainly
 
06:07:20.990 --> 06:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
know from the medical I'm not a
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
clinician but I certainly know from the
 
06:07:24.070 --> 06:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
medical literature that these
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
medications are used for other purposes
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
and so that would be of interest in a
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
sort of General Public Health um
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%

Hennessy I'm the president for New
 
06:08:40.910 --> 06:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life I'm here to
 
06:08:43.030 --> 06:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
represent our many members who are on
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
the prif side I also have some
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
experience in research and have a PhD in
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
computational sciences and
 
06:08:52.190 --> 06:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
statistics uh I I provided some written
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that has a lot of this I've
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
also emailed it to the members that were
 
06:08:56.270 --> 06:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the
 
06:08:58.868 --> 06:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
roster and I wanted to express four
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
reasons why I suggest that you vote itl
 
06:09:04.270 --> 06:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill the first one is that uh
 
06:09:06.548 --> 06:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
this is an infr on the free market if
 
06:09:08.910 --> 06:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
you look in the bill it has it it wants
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
to study things like increase Outreach
 
06:09:12.510 --> 06:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
in education and protect and expand
 
06:09:14.708 --> 06:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
access these are things that are already
 
06:09:16.350 --> 06:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
done in the private sector and which
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
should be handled by the free market
 
06:09:19.628 --> 06:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
especially for something so
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
controversial in our society where 70%
 
06:09:23.548 --> 06:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents believe that
 
06:09:24.510 --> 06:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions on abortion our nation's
 
06:09:29.788 --> 06:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
largest pharmacy CVS and and and as well
 
06:09:31.590 --> 06:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
as Walgreens and others have already
 
06:09:34.350 --> 06:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
announced their commitment to to
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
abortion pills we should let them take
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
care of the logistics and advertising
 
06:09:39.510 --> 06:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
for their product instead of having
 
06:09:42.030 --> 06:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers subsidize their business
 
06:09:44.708 --> 06:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
interests um despite this being a small
 
06:09:48.350 --> 06:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
a small outlay the principle is
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
important the second one is that this is
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
a solution to an unknown problem um the
 
06:09:55.110 --> 06:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
only threat that's been pointed out is
 
06:09:57.548 --> 06:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court and unless we're
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
planning to challenge Federal Supremacy
 
06:10:00.708 --> 06:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the state of New
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would do about that and I
 
06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
think challenging that would cost a lot
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
um third I I'd like to ask why is this
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
the priority I mean we would prefer that
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
there be no Financial restrictions I
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
mean that would be a great world to live
 
06:10:17.788 --> 06:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
in but that's not the world we live in
 
06:10:19.788 --> 06:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
we live in a world with restrictions so
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
are so what I haven't heard discussed is
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
what wouldn't be done as a result of
 
06:10:33.310 --> 06:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
passing this bill because there is much
 
06:10:36.310 --> 06:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
um HHS I I just looked at the website
 
06:10:38.468 --> 06:10:38.478 align:start position:0%
this morning has 85 openings which means
 
06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
there's many things that they can't do
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
now due to staff
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
shortages so the question is what would
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
they be giving up in order to do this
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
study I mean this is this is a big
 
06:10:52.830 --> 06:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
question um I I I found three examples
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
just from the past two months of of big
 
06:10:57.510 --> 06:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
deals uh in in healthcare in New
 
06:10:59.830 --> 06:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for instance uh Nationwide the
 
06:11:02.468 --> 06:11:02.478 align:start position:0%
current FDA currently lists 112 drugs in
 
06:11:05.628 --> 06:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
shortage 15 of which are oncology uh
 
06:11:07.548 --> 06:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
drugs and there's people who are dying
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
from these New Hampshire is facing a
 
06:11:11.948 --> 06:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage with the most nursing
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
openings per capita of any New England
 
06:11:15.990 --> 06:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
State and in March of this year New
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had 129 patients who could
 
06:11:19.468 --> 06:11:19.478 align:start position:0%
have been discharged but weren't because
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
of various reasons there were some that
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
even had to stay in hospitals for over
 
06:11:22.798 --> 06:11:23.708 align:start position:0%
even had to stay in hospitals for over
200

06:11:23.708 --> 06:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
200
 
06:11:26.310 --> 06:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
days but they didn't need to be there
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
these I would say that these are
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
probably uh more worth of our more
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
worthy of our
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
attention I also point out that house
 
06:11:38.910 --> 06:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
hhsa in a bipartisan vote of 10 to six
 
06:11:40.990 --> 06:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
said that this was not a priority at
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
least that's the way I interpret it
 
06:11:43.548 --> 06:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
although the vice chair is here and she
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
could she could uh explain that much
 
06:11:46.708 --> 06:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
better than I'm sure I
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
could and finally uh increasing access
 
06:11:52.190 --> 06:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
to abortion medications would also
 
06:11:53.548 --> 06:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
increase the danger to New Hampshire
 
06:11:54.910 --> 06:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant women both from forced or
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
coerced abortions as well as from signif
 
06:11:59.270 --> 06:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
the significant health risks that come
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
from the abortion pill I've included
 
06:12:03.548 --> 06:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
evidence in my in my written U my
 
06:12:05.548 --> 06:12:05.558 align:start position:0%
written testimony of the ex ex of the
 
06:12:08.190 --> 06:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
dangers to pregnant mothers um as well
 
06:12:10.590 --> 06:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
as for its documented use to abuse women
 
06:12:12.990 --> 06:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
by giving the pill to them unknowingly
 
06:12:15.468 --> 06:12:15.478 align:start position:0%
this is just bad policy and that's my
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I would be happy to take
 
06:12:17.040 --> 06:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I would be happy to take
any

06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%

567 okay any further thoughts as we go

we will take up then our last bill of
 
06:12:38.080 --> 06:12:40.590 align:start position:0%
we will take up then our last bill of
the

06:12:40.590 --> 06:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:44.990 --> 06:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
day and that is Senate Bill
 
06:12:47.510 --> 06:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
596 this is an act relative to the
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
definition of disability or special
 
06:12:57.910 --> 06:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:01.910 --> 06:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
program by means of some background here
 
06:13:01.920 --> 06:13:03.628 align:start position:0%
program by means of some background here
this

06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:07.310 --> 06:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill started in Senate education with an
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.628 --> 06:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
study it was then removed from consent
 
06:13:19.030 --> 06:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
calendar and voted ought to pass on a
 
06:13:19.040 --> 06:13:19.910 align:start position:0%
calendar and voted ought to pass on a
Voice

06:13:19.910 --> 06:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
Voice
 
06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
vote it then went to the Senate finance
 
06:13:25.708 --> 06:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
Zer then came from to the U House
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
Education committee 11
 
06:13:34.190 --> 06:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
to9 and then out of the house with a
 
06:13:38.150 --> 06:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
170 let's go to the fiscal note I see we
 
06:13:44.430 --> 06:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
have a revised fiscal note dated May 6th
 
06:13:45.590 --> 06:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is the most
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
recent the amount here looks like
 
06:13:50.590 --> 06:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
372,000 in fiscal year
 
06:13:54.510 --> 06:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
2025 followed by 744 th000 in both
 
06:13:57.708 --> 06:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 2026 and
 
06:14:01.230 --> 06:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
2027 anything further on that Mr
 
06:14:03.548 --> 06:14:03.558 align:start position:0%
Ripple I would only call your attention
 
06:14:07.510 --> 06:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
to the source of fund funds so as with a
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
previous bill in this committee you'll
 
06:14:11.788 --> 06:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
notice that the appropriation with the
 
06:14:14.350 --> 06:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
exception of $1 is Federal arpa or other
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds and it includes language
 
06:14:20.868 --> 06:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
up on lines 5 through 7 allowing the
 
06:14:22.830 --> 06:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
department to suspend implementation if
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:29.270 --> 06:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
insufficient okay thank you so this does
 
06:14:31.868 --> 06:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
have an arpa might as well jump right to
 
06:14:35.670 --> 06:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:37.150 --> 06:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
I see on the first page of the bill
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
assuming every assuming everybody has
 
06:14:43.430 --> 06:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill they do uh on
 
06:14:45.110 --> 06:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
starting on line
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
25 that's right arpa or other federal
 
06:14:51.390 --> 06:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
funds if available okay anyone here to
 
06:14:57.070 --> 06:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:08.190 --> 06:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
hello thank you uh my name is Brian
 
06:15:10.350 --> 06:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
Clark I'm the general counsel for the
 
06:15:12.150 --> 06:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
division of economic
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
stability uh so Senate Bill 596 what it
 
06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
would do is give the department the
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt rules to expand um
 
06:15:25.548 --> 06:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
the protected class in um the New
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Child Care scholarship program
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire Child Care
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship program as I testified
 
06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
before is a program that provides child
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
care subsidies to low-income individuals
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
who participate in qualifying activities
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so what we do currently is that for
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
for kids that are eligible for child
 
06:15:50.708 --> 06:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
care scholarship if they have particular
 
06:15:50.718 --> 06:15:51.868 align:start position:0%
care scholarship if they have particular
special

06:15:51.868 --> 06:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
special
 
06:15:54.788 --> 06:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
needs um such as
 
06:15:58.030 --> 06:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities that have been diagnosed we
 
06:16:00.190 --> 06:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
could pay what is called a differential
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
to the child care provider which is just
 
06:16:05.430 --> 06:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
an increase to the payment
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
to recognize that the kid with special
 
06:16:10.510 --> 06:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
needs might take a little more staff
 
06:16:13.868 --> 06:16:13.878 align:start position:0%
time um and so it kind of incentivizes
 
06:16:17.070 --> 06:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
taking those individual children um and
 
06:16:19.150 --> 06:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
so what the sponsors of the legislation
 
06:16:23.468 --> 06:16:23.478 align:start position:0%
were trying to fix is kids who are at
 
06:16:25.990 --> 06:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
risk of or experiencing social or
 
06:16:27.750 --> 06:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
emotional developmental
 
06:16:32.230 --> 06:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
delays um who are young very young um
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
and are likely have
 
06:16:39.868 --> 06:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
issues um potentially like autism
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder uh but they're waiting
 
06:16:45.270 --> 06:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
to get a diagnosis because the waight
 
06:16:47.070 --> 06:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
list to see a specialist who can make
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis is sometimes years
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
long so what the bill was seeking to do
 
06:16:55.750 --> 06:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and what the department would do
 
06:16:58.510 --> 06:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking is allow screening
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
tools instead of an official diagnosis
 
06:17:04.948 --> 06:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
to determine uh that a child has
 
06:17:08.270 --> 06:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
significant special needs um and then be
 
06:17:12.830 --> 06:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:17.110 --> 06:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
payment okay so thank you for that um in
 
06:17:18.190 --> 06:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
on page
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
one line 13 through
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
15 uh there
 
06:17:27.548 --> 06:17:27.558 align:start position:0%
is a definition of disability or special
 
06:17:29.430 --> 06:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
needs under the child care scholarship
 
06:17:31.948 --> 06:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
program and shall include any child who
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
displays or is at risk for delayed
 
06:17:38.590 --> 06:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
social or emotional development is there
 
06:17:42.270 --> 06:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
a definition of delayed social or
 
06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
emotional development in
 
06:17:48.030 --> 06:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
writing uh so we would need to develop
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
that and it would be based on the
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
specific uh clinical tool we select so
 
06:17:58.110 --> 06:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
the clinical tool would measure whether
 
06:18:01.350 --> 06:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
that exists whether the social or
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
emotional it would have to be signed by
 
06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
a approved by a
 
06:18:11.990 --> 06:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.830 --> 06:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you representative Lyon um
 
06:18:19.548 --> 06:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um are there any
 
06:18:21.788 --> 06:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
of these existing screening tools and
 
06:18:24.270 --> 06:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
can that information be provided because
 
06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
it seems kind of without a specific tool
 
06:18:28.750 --> 06:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
and without naming a tool this seems a
 
06:18:28.760 --> 06:18:30.390 align:start position:0%
and without naming a tool this seems a
little

06:18:30.390 --> 06:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
little
 
06:18:34.430 --> 06:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
broad so this what this version of the
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
leg islation was um the result of a
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
compromise between uh the the department
 
06:18:44.230 --> 06:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
and uh Advocates um the department would
 
06:18:46.948 --> 06:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
like to see select screening tools that
 
06:18:48.868 --> 06:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
that we designate so that we don't have
 
06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:57.110 --> 06:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
tools as a followup would it be possible
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
to know what some of those tools are or
 
06:19:02.030 --> 06:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
to at least have that information sent
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
to us because I don't know if we'll be
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
able to adjust digest it at the moment
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
anyways okay uh well I know that um in
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
earlier versions of uh the the initial
 
06:19:15.948 --> 06:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
introduced version had those tools
 
06:19:18.830 --> 06:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
listed uh what we' like to do is through
 
06:19:21.110 --> 06:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
Ru making specifically identify which
 
06:19:23.310 --> 06:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
one we would like to be used so that we
 
06:19:25.628 --> 06:19:25.638 align:start position:0%
don't have to train on all of
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
sense it sort of makes sense except that
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
the r making should follow the statutory
 
06:19:34.320 --> 06:19:35.230 align:start position:0%
the r making should follow the statutory
guidance

06:19:35.230 --> 06:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
06:19:37.070 --> 06:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so I think it would be a lot cleaner
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
to look at what we're actually looking
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:44.350 --> 06:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
but okay anything
 
06:19:46.750 --> 06:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
further all right thank you very much
 
06:19:49.230 --> 06:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
once again you were here earlier today
 
06:19:51.430 --> 06:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes yeah once again you're taking on the
 
06:19:55.150 --> 06:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
role of it seems sponsor and explainer
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
and for your department and everything
 
06:19:58.510 --> 06:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
is the first one to testify so I truly
 
06:20:00.910 --> 06:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh your ability to come
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
forward and handle all these questions
 
06:20:05.788 --> 06:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise likely given to the
 
06:20:07.548 --> 06:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Bill thank you very much
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
596 thank you madam chair honorable
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
Michelle Merritt I'm the president at
 
06:20:27.868 --> 06:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
new Futures I'm going to be brief and
 
06:20:28.948 --> 06:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to my
 
06:20:31.510 --> 06:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
colleague um I wanted to take a moment
 
06:20:33.548 --> 06:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
to explain sort of um some of the
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
procedural things that happened with
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
this bill I think unfortunately before
 
06:20:39.670 --> 06:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
it got to you um so the bill was
 
06:20:41.430 --> 06:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
introduced by Senator Rashard in the
 
06:20:43.510 --> 06:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and passed through the Senate
 
06:20:46.628 --> 06:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
without incident um when it crossed over
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the house unfortunately I think that
 
06:20:54.030 --> 06:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
there was um some uh I don't necessarily
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to say error but it was assigned to
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
the education committee when it's a DHHS
 
06:21:01.230 --> 06:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
um particular program um and our
 
06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
experience with the education committee
 
06:21:06.030 --> 06:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
was um that when it was being discussed
 
06:21:08.190 --> 06:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
in that committee there was not a lot of
 
06:21:09.750 --> 06:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the child care
 
06:21:11.868 --> 06:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
scholarship program was and the special
 
06:21:13.948 --> 06:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
committee on child care and speaking
 
06:21:15.350 --> 06:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
with the chairman did not have an
 
06:21:16.628 --> 06:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity because it was a second
 
06:21:18.430 --> 06:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
committee Bill to take it into the
 
06:21:21.310 --> 06:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
special committee on Child Care um so it
 
06:21:24.190 --> 06:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't up for an inter it was a a debate
 
06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
between an interim study and a um ought
 
06:21:29.548 --> 06:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
to pass in that particular committee um
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we were working really hard with the
 
06:21:31.948 --> 06:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
committee but they had lingering
 
06:21:33.390 --> 06:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions we didn't have enough time to
 
06:21:36.030 --> 06:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
answer so um that just explains a little
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
bit about why we think it encountered a
 
06:21:40.190 --> 06:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
hiccup um in that particular committee
 
06:21:42.868 --> 06:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
because it really was a DHHS item um so
 
06:21:44.788 --> 06:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
I thought that history might be a little
 
06:21:47.468 --> 06:21:47.478 align:start position:0%
bit in Illuminating for some of
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
you go ahead thanks um my name is
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
Rebecca vo kovsky and I'm the child and
 
06:21:54.350 --> 06:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
family policy director at new Futures so
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
I'll just Begin by saying that um we've
 
06:21:59.070 --> 06:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
been bringing together a group of early
 
06:22:01.070 --> 06:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
care and education providers over the
 
06:22:03.430 --> 06:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
past 2 years and one of the number one
 
06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
concerns um for these providers has been
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
around capacity of teachers and centers
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
to take in kids who have more
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
challenging um behavioral needs but do
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
not have a formal diagnosis of special
 
06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
needs or disability um this bill would
 
06:22:21.070 --> 06:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
really be essential for child care
 
06:22:23.310 --> 06:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
centers to be able to maintain the
 
06:22:25.468 --> 06:22:25.478 align:start position:0%
number of slots they have and take in
 
06:22:27.468 --> 06:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
more kids as well as support their
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
teaching staff I want to emphasize that
 
06:22:32.310 --> 06:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um provides a differential but
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide a treatment for a
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
child that was a confusion in um House
 
06:22:39.150 --> 06:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
Education this is about supporting and
 
06:22:41.910 --> 06:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
strengthening Child Care Centers I also
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
want to indicate that this bill does not
 
06:22:46.750 --> 06:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
create new screenings for children
 
06:22:48.670 --> 06:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
children are being um having
 
06:22:50.788 --> 06:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
developmental screening on a regular
 
06:22:53.350 --> 06:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
basis through their child care center or
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
their um pediatrician this just creates
 
06:23:00.190 --> 06:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
a pathway for those kids um to be able
 
06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to enter a child care setting and that
 
06:23:03.910 --> 06:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
child care center to be prepared to take
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
06:23:06.990 --> 06:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
um we do know that some Child Care
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
Centers unfortunately are using
 
06:23:10.670 --> 06:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
developmental screenings to root out
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
children that may have more complex
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
needs because they can't take them in so
 
06:23:17.350 --> 06:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what we don't want to create
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a system where children who have more
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
complex needs can't access child care I
 
06:23:24.270 --> 06:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
also want to emphasize that this child
 
06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
care differential would not just be
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
available to center-based care but again
 
06:23:30.350 --> 06:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
because it is in our child care
 
06:23:31.910 --> 06:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
development block grant this would be
 
06:23:34.830 --> 06:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
available to our inhome providers our um
 
06:23:37.628 --> 06:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
Center based providers and others to
 
06:23:39.548 --> 06:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
answer your question um representative
 
06:23:41.788 --> 06:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
Leon in the first version of the bill
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
Advocates did outline the um standard
 
06:23:47.830 --> 06:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood screenings that could be
 
06:23:50.030 --> 06:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
used but I'll happily provide those to
 
06:23:53.310 --> 06:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
you offline I also want to indicate that
 
06:23:55.868 --> 06:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
Advocates do have some question on the
 
06:23:57.670 --> 06:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are listed for
 
06:24:01.548 --> 06:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
future years childcare advisory reported
 
06:24:04.390 --> 06:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
on the expenditures in this line of C
 
06:24:06.590 --> 06:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
CDF and to date it has only been
 
06:24:10.708 --> 06:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
$558,000 this year so we think that a
 
06:24:13.230 --> 06:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
more modest um future fiscal note is
 
06:24:15.548 --> 06:24:15.558 align:start position:0%
probably more likely and I will say that
 
06:24:17.190 --> 06:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
you can tell there's been a downward
 
06:24:19.750 --> 06:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
Trend so this definition of disability
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
is so narrow that kids and families are
 
06:24:24.628 --> 06:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
not able to access or not be childcare
 
06:24:26.708 --> 06:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
centers can't access this differential
 
06:24:28.750 --> 06:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
and it is creating a um barrier to
 
06:24:30.468 --> 06:24:30.478 align:start position:0%
access for our kids that have more
 
06:24:35.390 --> 06:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.670 --> 06:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon followed by
 
06:24:40.350 --> 06:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
representative priest um thank you um it
 
06:24:42.948 --> 06:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
almost seems like a gem of the testimony
 
06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
just came out with that if they're using
 
06:24:47.230 --> 06:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
these screening tests to keep kids out
 
06:24:48.830 --> 06:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the child care centers wouldn't that
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
just be priority number one to not allow
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
them to screen them out with it I'm not
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
sure why that wasn't the bill well um I
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
think that it's a bit unspoken yes it's
 
06:25:01.390 --> 06:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
unspoken so it's one of those things
 
06:25:02.990 --> 06:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
where Child Care Centers say that they
 
06:25:04.628 --> 06:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity to take kids
 
06:25:06.230 --> 06:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't pay our early care and
 
06:25:08.910 --> 06:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
education um providers to necessarily
 
06:25:11.628 --> 06:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
train their staff um we have a child
 
06:25:13.390 --> 06:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
care crisis so we don't have the
 
06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
adequate number of sta Staffing that we
 
06:25:17.948 --> 06:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
need um and I don't know that there's
 
06:25:19.628 --> 06:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
precedent in this state where the state
 
06:25:23.190 --> 06:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
legislature can um or has passed a
 
06:25:27.230 --> 06:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on screening children for um
 
06:25:28.708 --> 06:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
developmental issues and then
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that with regards to child
 
06:25:32.468 --> 06:25:32.478 align:start position:0%
care I think that our childcare Market
 
06:25:36.750 --> 06:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
would um against that representative
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
Leon and as a followup do those
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
screenings require parental consent yes
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
they do the ages and stages
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
questionnaire which I will provide to
 
06:25:47.390 --> 06:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
you after is both a parent and provider
 
06:25:50.750 --> 06:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
screening um important to note too that
 
06:25:52.990 --> 06:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
many children who are screened to
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
qualify for services you have to be 33
 
06:25:54.958 --> 06:25:55.628 align:start position:0%
qualify for services you have to be 33
and

06:25:55.628 --> 06:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
1/3% um delayed for state level Services
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
if you fall below that um if you don't
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
meet that amount then your private
 
06:26:05.548 --> 06:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
insurance has to cover um but it also
 
06:26:07.468 --> 06:26:07.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't lead to a formal diagnosis so
 
06:26:09.750 --> 06:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's this whole gray area where kids
 
06:26:11.788 --> 06:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
need access to additional services but
 
06:26:14.990 --> 06:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
can't get them um I would also say that
 
06:26:18.190 --> 06:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
you know it is in our best interest to
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that kids have access to high
 
06:26:22.830 --> 06:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
quality um centers whether that's in
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
home faith-based or in Center based
 
06:26:28.070 --> 06:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
because it saves money in the long
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
term so the only thing that I'll add um
 
06:26:33.910 --> 06:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
to Rebecca's uh answer to the question
 
06:26:36.270 --> 06:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
is one of the experiences that we've
 
06:26:39.070 --> 06:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
seen is that child care centers who have
 
06:26:40.910 --> 06:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
children with that fall into this
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
category um in order to be able to serve
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
them they have to artificially
 
06:26:47.948 --> 06:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
suppressed ratios um or not serve them
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
and open up those slots to other kids so
 
06:26:52.390 --> 06:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
it is getting at that uh by addressing
 
06:26:54.590 --> 06:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
this issue is making sure that the
 
06:26:56.548 --> 06:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
centers have enough funds available to
 
06:26:58.510 --> 06:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
them to appropriately manage those kids
 
06:27:00.070 --> 06:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
in those classes so they don't have to
 
06:27:03.708 --> 06:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
be put in that catch22 situation um
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is an important Point
 
06:27:05.520 --> 06:27:06.670 align:start position:0%
which is an important Point
representative

06:27:06.670 --> 06:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Madame chairman for taking
 
06:27:12.390 --> 06:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you for being here
 
06:27:16.030 --> 06:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh again uh on the fiscal note uh I
 
06:27:19.670 --> 06:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
would like to have you um restate what
 
06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
you think would be a realistic cost
 
06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
given what you're seeing now as special
 
06:27:31.510 --> 06:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
needs children in um Child Care
 
06:27:33.628 --> 06:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
Facilities what I'd like to do is send
 
06:27:36.030 --> 06:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
you what was presented to a childcare
 
06:27:38.270 --> 06:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
advisory on the recent drawdowns um it
 
06:27:39.990 --> 06:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
shows what has been expended in this
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
line over um the past three years and at
 
06:27:45.270 --> 06:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
the height it has um been about
 
06:27:47.910 --> 06:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
$255,000 a year but currently right now
 
06:27:47.920 --> 06:27:48.708 align:start position:0%
$255,000 a year but currently right now
it's

06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:27:51.750 --> 06:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
58,000 um so I can provide that data I
 
06:27:53.670 --> 06:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
would also offer that I'm happy to work
 
06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department on a revised um
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note if they're willing based on
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
recent Trends on expenditures and the
 
06:28:02.150 --> 06:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
total for the last fiscal year again our
 
06:28:08.190 --> 06:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
$95,000 okay thank you for that was
 
06:28:15.468 --> 06:28:15.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:18.788 --> 06:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
no okay uh thank you very much so you'd
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
be willing to work on a fiscal note
 
06:28:22.510 --> 06:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely we already connected with the
 
06:28:24.868 --> 06:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
Department um so we all happy to do that
 
06:28:26.350 --> 06:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll look for that for
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
additional information going forward
 
06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um I hesitate if anybody's
 
06:28:34.510 --> 06:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
doing um
 
06:28:36.750 --> 06:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendments on this bill that there be
 
06:28:39.670 --> 06:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
any sort of policy change to the
 
06:28:42.430 --> 06:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
definition of disability or trying to
 
06:28:44.230 --> 06:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know make up a definition for
 
06:28:46.150 --> 06:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
delayed social or emotional development
 
06:28:49.548 --> 06:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
I think in my opinion that crosses from
 
06:28:53.070 --> 06:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
Finance to policy pretty clearly and
 
06:28:57.670 --> 06:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
obviously just my three cents okay any
 
06:29:01.788 --> 06:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
further comment on Senate Bill
 
06:29:05.230 --> 06:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
596 okay with
 
06:29:09.190 --> 06:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
