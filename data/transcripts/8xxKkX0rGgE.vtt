00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
it doesn't okay
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everybody and
 
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
welcome to the subcommittee for
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
uh HBA 354
 
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and just so everybody's aware where
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
we're going there are a number of
 
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
reasons why HP 354 was retained one yes
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's a charter school Bill where School
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
building Aid would be directed towards
 
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
the construction and eligibility of this
 
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
those schools to receive State dollars
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
but two we are also very very concerned
 
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 align:start position:0%
after we have gone through the process
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
of other bills this year dealing with
 
00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 align:start position:0%
school building Aid when we're seeing
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's some level of dissatisfaction in
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
regard to the funding formula for school
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
building Aid within this state and
 
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
within this legislature and by that I
 
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
mean there was a a draft Amendment
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
proposed by a legislator
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
to fund School building Aid based upon
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
per capita amount each year
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
and that Drew a number of issues and
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
concerns the per capita you know costs
 
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
like that one would take some school
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
districts based upon how many years do
 
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
we talk about Amy about 90 to 100 years
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
before they'd have enough money for a
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse but two it also provided
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
money to school districts like Albany
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
that don't have schools and there would
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
be no need for school construction
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
dollars so there are a lot of issues
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
there and so we're gonna have to tackle
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
both of these issues and while we're
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the the bill itself we
 
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
also then are going to be going Way
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond in terms of that whole chapter of
 
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
law in terms with school building Aid
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
and um as you know there is a limited
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of schools which receive Charter
 
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 align:start position:0%
building Aid each year
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and of course it's capped also at up to
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
50 million bucks uh
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
the the and we'll get into it that's
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
obviously not covering what our needs
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
are in the state right now
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so with that
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
um many districts that see themselves
 
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 align:start position:0%
way down that list they're saying I'm
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
never going to see school building a
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars so why should I vote for this
 
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.290 align:start position:0%
dollars so why should I vote for this
bill

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
and so or any bill on that see it's
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to be so delayed that it's not
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
going to ever really you know be
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
productive for my particular community
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to get on with it
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
today we have uh representative Mooney's
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
here and she is the prime sponsor of
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
354. we also have Amy Clark from the
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which when I
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
talked with Amy she was willing to give
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
us an overview of where we are with
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and on some ideas
 
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 align:start position:0%
too as Maybe
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
Concepts that we should be thinking
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
about and where we're going and and
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
where we might go with a formula which
 
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.610 align:start position:0%
where we might go with a formula which
um

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of issues and
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
we'll see some of those addressed today
 
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.529 align:start position:0%
we'll see some of those addressed today
so

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna start off for about five or
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
ten minutes Maureen can you give a brief
 
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
overview of your bill just for a short
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
time and then we're going to get into uh
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
the doe and and then get on to our
 
00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.950 align:start position:0%
the doe and and then get on to our
discussion

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
there are no need for pink cards today
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Maureen Mooney
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
Merrimack that's Hillsborough County
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
District 12. first of all I want to
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time to
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
thoroughly discuss and review this bill
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor on House Bill 354.
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'll keep my comments brief but I do
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
want to do three things I'm going to
 
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
give you a long-term history a
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
short-term history and then review what
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bill does in two parts
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the long term
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
I introduced a very similar Bill to this
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
one and it was to allow public charter
 
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:28.940 align:start position:0%
schools to apply apply in the process
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid doesn't mean get
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
it it means apply
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
there were several questions with that
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill last term with regards to who owns
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
the building and what would happen so on
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
so forth so I took that and worked with
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
others to craft language which brings me
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
to the short term I introduced then
 
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 354 which incorporates
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
answers to questions of who owns the
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
building and this being limited to only
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
those charter schools that own their own
 
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.090 align:start position:0%
those charter schools that own their own
buildings

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
now House Bill 354 was retained in this
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee this past year
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
but also I'll have you know this
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
in-house Finance I introduced this exact
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
Bill word for word as an amendment to
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:23.300 align:start position:0%
house finance committee
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
adopted this exact language to House
 
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 with a vote of 25 to zero
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 then went from house
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
finance to the floor of the house and as
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
you know it passed through the floor of
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
the house on a Voice vote
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
the language then
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
was then removed in Senate finance
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
committee why I don't know
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 then adopted as we know
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
just last Thursday and this has been
 
00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
just last Thursday and this has been
excluded

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that then leads me to the content of
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
it does in my opinion
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
two things
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
first and I'd like to give a handout if
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
I could to clarify this point
 
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:16.940 align:start position:0%
it clears up a very obvious
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
contradiction currently in New Hampshire
 
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:41.170 align:start position:0%
contradiction currently in New Hampshire
law

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've created this handout
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently an RSA 194 hyphen B colon 11
 
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.150 align:start position:0%
currently an RSA 194 hyphen B colon 11

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
7.
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
no school building Aid shall be awarded
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
to public charter schools
 
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.610 align:start position:0%
to public charter schools
clear

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
then in 198 colon 15 hyphen B
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of the grant to any chartered
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
Public School established in accordance
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
with RSA 194 B3 shall be 30 percent of
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
the eligible cost of construction
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
I go back to a bill that was introduced
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
in house finance this past year and it
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
was to fund a position at the Department
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
of Education for an attorney to go
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
through the education statute
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
specifically and recodify them and find
 
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.310 align:start position:0%
specifically and recodify them and find
contradictions

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
contradictions
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
when the Department of Education
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
introduced that bill to house finance
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
they used this
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
as the example for why the position was
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
needed and why there are discrepancies
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
and controversies and contradictions and
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
cleanups needed in the education
 
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
cleanups needed in the education
statutes

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
this Bell House Bill 354 would clean it
 
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.449 align:start position:0%
this Bell House Bill 354 would clean it
up

00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
you would remove where it says Charter
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
Schools cannot receive building Aid it
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
Part B of what this bill does again I go
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's simply allows
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
public chartered schools in New
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that own their own buildings
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
to apply and go through the process like
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other Public School in New Hampshire
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
so that would require review by the
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education you know warrant
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
articles the whole nine yards there
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
which can be articulated best by Amy
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
Clark and those from the Department of
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
Ed that are here
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
simply would allow public charter
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
schools again that own their own
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
buildings to apply whether or not they
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
get it that's up to the process this
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill would allow them to apply
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
so with that Mr chairman I've given you
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
the history of the bill from last term
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
the most recent history of the bill
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
including it coming out of Finance 25 to
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
nothing and being attached to the house
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
version of House Bill 2 only to be
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
scraped by the Senate and then here we
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
are today and what the bill would do I
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
do have uh people here from the
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and from the
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
charter school community that would also
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
like to speak I'm sure and answer
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them and with that
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
I will conclude my testimony and thank
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
you again all of you for your time thank
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
is there a need for any further
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
information from
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
nuts thank you
 
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:39.740 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do then now is that
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
would 354 we know that this was taken
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
out of hb2 so we're right now where we
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
were at the beginning of this year
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
without building Aid going to the
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:55.970 align:start position:0%
charter schools
um

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
now there's also the issue that we had
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
with several other bills dealing with
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
that we had requested funding uh that
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
would support some of the needs for
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
public schools and we again are are been
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
limited uh there too as well so what I'd
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
like to do is take a moment right now uh
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
and invite Amy Clark up to try and and
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
walk us through a little bit of
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
information but go ahead and set up Amy
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
um I want to also explain what is in
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
your pack of the materials that you've
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
received here
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
um you know of course a copy of 354.
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
that should be right the first on the on
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
the list there
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
then there was this a sheet which
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
identified hb2 building 8 considerations
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to just allude this
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
very quickly here on the bottom of that
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
sheet this looks like there's a table up
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
there I don't want you looking at the
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
table itself I want to look at the the
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
bottom of that sheet and going on to the
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
next sheet
 
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
um there's issues needing resolution
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
here with the current
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
formula and that which was proposed by
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
the representative do it on a per pupil
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.769 align:start position:0%
the representative do it on a per pupil
basis

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this committee's
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
got to resolve here is there a way to
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
fund smaller projects alongside the
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
larger ones we have a number of projects
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
that come in which are asking for
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
much lesser money than the big uh 80
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
million dollar projects or the 20
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
million dollar projects these might be
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
projects three million dollars or less
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
to renovate a Schoolhouse primarily a a
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
lot of these smaller k through eight
 
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
lot of these smaller k through eight
districts

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
then we also have questions which are on
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
the our considerations on the second
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
side how do Charters fit into the
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
process we just heard this and uh we
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
have to be looking at you know are we
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be funding at 30 we fund from
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 percent based upon medium
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
income families and property valuations
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
what about emergency projects
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
there's another issue which we have to
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of should billing Aid pay
 
00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:16.339 align:start position:0%
for Career Technical education space
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's used within a high school
 
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.710 align:start position:0%
that's used within a high school
situation

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
through security and safety issues need
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
to rise to the top
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
of our formula and we do have the
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund but that's uh not
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the issues that would
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
come under play here with some of the
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
other safety type issues within the
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
buildings access like you know do you
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
have access to the second floor of your
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
building Believe It or Not we've had
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
within just the last year or so one
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
building a project went out to just
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
afford a person in a wheelchair to get
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
into the school
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
more or less to the second floor of the
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
school in Romney to get up to where his
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
or her student was receiving an
 
00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.170 align:start position:0%
or her student was receiving an
education

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
um going on down we did look at this uh
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
should charitable trust be quests gifts
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
insurance policies be subtracted from
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
their state grant that was an issue that
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
was brought up by
 
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:18.620 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden here and uh uh
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
those folks from in the superintendent
 
00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:22.909 align:start position:0%
those folks from in the superintendent
Taylor

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
Taylor
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
in regard to new construction offset
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
State share a building Grant by sale of
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
any assets building property from
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
previous facilities should the sale the
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
property offset what they get from the
 
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.950 align:start position:0%
property offset what they get from the
grant

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
consideration or the sale of the lease
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
studying methods of ensuring long-term
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
sustaining sustainability funding for
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
school buildings and identify sources of
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
such funds
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
sustainability is very important but
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
even more so where do these funds come
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
from we have tried for years to have
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
more than 50 million dollars per year
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
allocated to schools you can put in
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
bills say no less than 50 million every
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
time we've done that we've met a brick
 
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
time we've done that we've met a brick
wall

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
wall
 
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
already going on down should State share
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
of Grant be flat funded
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um consider Community wealth these but
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
flat funded but we also consider some
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
variables like Community wealth income
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
levels levels of grades in the school of
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
geographic location demographics of the
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
school itself should 80 be provided
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
immediately immediately upon you know in
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
the formula right now you get a grant 80
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
percent of the state share comes to you
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
right out of the blocks uh it used not
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
to be like that we put it at 80 percent
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that the we could reduce the interest
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
costs of the local school district
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
they used to get it incrementally over
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
the period duration of that loan
 
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.529 align:start position:0%
the period duration of that loan
um

00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh and or should it be reduced so it's
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
spread over the life of the bond uh if
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
you did that you could probably fund a
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
few more projects each year but then you
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
run the risk of going closer to a tail
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
again more debt which we had 540 million
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
dollars debt when I first came on board
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
here in school building eight alone
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
um assess eligibility criteria based
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
upon need and we want to look at other
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
state funding models we had our
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
researcher back to the table there I did
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
briefly one day and she came in and
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
presented several other types of plans
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
which were going in the state of
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
Kentucky in the state of Virginia we we
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
want to look at that too and lastly
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
what is the state condition of our
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
buildings right now we've never been
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
able other than the surveys put out by
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
Doe to ascertain what you think you have
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
there behind that wall whether you think
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
there's asbestos there or not
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and that custodian might say yeah
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
well we got it there may not be anything
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
there uh so we we need to really
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
ascertain what is out there as far as
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
the the buildings in terms of the same
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
assessment for every school house in
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
this state so we have some consistent
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
criteria so we can start projecting uh
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
in the cost for our 10-year plan which
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
we've thought so hard to do so that's
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
where we are with some of the issues
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
which we have to attack and and try to
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
address here right now before we talk to
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
Amy yes yeah I think there's another
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
issue that uh Beyond this list and that
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
is there is didn't we retain a bill that
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
dealt with the dissolution of charter
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
schools and how that should be done it
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that that also is a is
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
a related issue here
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
because if charter schools are in fact
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
going to begin getting money and they
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
should ultimately that and put that into
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
a building
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
and ultimately
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
dissolve as we have I think we've had
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
like five or six of our charter schools
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
have uh dissolved what is a relationship
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
of the money that goes into that Charter
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
School from the states as far as
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
building goes
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
what happens to that who's responsible
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
for it where's the money come from
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
where's the asset and the um the growth
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
of that asset what happens to it so that
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
I think Rick that's a that's a related
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
issue here yes definitely and and the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools uh when we look at
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
building a for the charter schools all
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
this comes from the play and as we've
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
read parts of the of the law if a
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
charter school does dissolve
 
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
then who ends up having to pay that
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
burden for the debt that that District
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
may have been in the district and also
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
that and also the value of that asset so
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
so yeah so there's a lot to this and so
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna have to really engage
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
and work hard on this from the charter
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
school perspective and from the
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
perspective of Aid to all public schools
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to hand it off
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
to you Amy if you can give us a a brief
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
background uh of where we are on all
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
this it'd be appreciated sure uh so I
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
know I've met all of you several times
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
at this point but again my name is Amy
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
Clark and I work for the Department of
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
Education in the Bureau of school
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
facilities uh building Aid falls under
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
my Bureau as well uh and so I um I'm
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
happy to go over the summary that's in
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
your packet if you feel that it's
 
00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:35.870 align:start position:0%
your packet if you feel that it's
helpful

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
um and kind of just give you a
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
step one through building aid but I also
 
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
don't wanna
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
if you all feel like you're experts and
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're good to go but I also know you
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
hear from a lot of Department of
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
Education so I'm happy to do that
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
overview again would that be helpful
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think it would be you know
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
you can do a shorter version to hit on
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
is the 30 to the 60 and and some of the
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
criteria you're using in awarding these
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
grants out sure um and I believe that's
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
in your packet so
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
um representative Ladd just went over
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
that list I think the next is
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
um House Bill two looks like there's
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
some research and then it gets to this
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
page uh which is just the cover sheet so
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you get to that page that's where I'm
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
going to kind of start that's a copy of
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
um the summary that I typically give uh
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
and so the following page so it's just
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
like what's in this packet that's a
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
table of contents page with my contact
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
information if you ever need me
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna really spend time on
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
this page mine is color copied I don't
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
think yours is but
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
um it has a table at the bottom uh so
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
essentially uh building Aid RSA 195 15
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
we have rules that support it um under
 
00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:57.740 align:start position:0%
Ed 321 and the basics really are
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
building Aid is just the state portion
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
of a large construction project what
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
um you already mentioned CT no it's no
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
we don't well
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the CTE funding
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
program which a lot of people know know
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
about it is not Public School
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund money so when you
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
hear about security grants and things
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
like that that's not also not building
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
Aid there's another portion
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
um lease Aid falls under 198.15 and
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's lease grants to charter schools
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
for to help pay for the lease payments
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's under RSA 19815 but that is also
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
not building Aid building Aid is really
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
for large construction projects
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney mentioned that
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
there is in building Aid right now
 
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:48.260 align:start position:0%
charter schools are
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
eligible through 198.15 but are
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
prohibited through 194 B from applying
 
00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.169 align:start position:0%
prohibited through 194 B from applying
so

00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um just to Echo what she said that
 
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
um to be honest when I started I was
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
only in charge of 198 15 rules and uh
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
charter school called me within the
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
first year and I was like yeah fill out
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
an application so
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so um so it was news to me a little
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
later on that they were not eligible I
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
apologized and we didn't end up getting
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
any money anyway so
 
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.110 align:start position:0%
any money anyway so
um

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
through building Aid ranges the building
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
Aid rate for the state's portion of this
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
large construction project is 30 to 60
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
percent it's not a linear formula
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
meaning the average isn't between those
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
numbers it's heavily weighted to the 38
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
to the 30 percent end the average rate
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
for schools is 38 percent uh in
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
um using that formula
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
uh and as you can imagine more affluent
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
communities are at the 30 percent range
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
less affluent are at the 60 percent
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
range there's not a ton of schools at
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
that 60 percent uh the funding source is
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and Remains the
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
education trust fund didn't have to make
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
an edit there
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
um the history of building Aid the quick
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
history of building Aid is it has been
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
around since the 40s the 1940s and has
 
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
been given reliably to all construction
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
projects for public schools all the way
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
up through 2009 uh so I just want to say
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
that one more time because I think it's
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
important to remember that at one time
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
the state paid for a portion 30 to 60
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
percent the formula has changed over the
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
years but it's been 30 to 60 percent of
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
any public school construction project
 
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:46.460 align:start position:0%
even things that are now not eligible
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
were eligible prior to 2009 uh what was
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
eligible were SAU offices that's no
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
longer eligible what was eligible would
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
be if a school wanted to replace all
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
their windows or do a roof replacement
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
that was eligible and those are no
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
longer eligible so just keep in mind
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the kind of the history that
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's been there
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
the law changed in 20 so essentially
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
what happened I'm going to go down to
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
this table in in the green here uh or
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
you don't have the color copy sorry the
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
the table below
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
um essentially from 1946 to 2009 that
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
63-year period money was appropriated to
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
meet demand so the application
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
applications would come to the
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
department the department would report
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the legislature how much money was
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
being asked for and then that money was
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
appropriated a few times it was a
 
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
appropriated a few times it was a
shortfall

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
and we would short all the schools the
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
same rate so maybe the state was short
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
five percent and we would um cut those
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
Awards across the board by five percent
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
um a few years there were shortfalls but
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
not many that I that I'm aware of
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
um from 2010 to 2019 so the following
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
10-year period there was a two-year
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
moratorium that was put in place so a
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
two-year moratorium started in 2010 and
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
schools what I think just to kind of
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
think about as a person from a school
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
what they thought was two years
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
because I think this is really important
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
they thought two years it's a temporary
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
moratorium will come out of moratorium
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
who is going to build during that two
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
two years when they know the grant
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
program is going to be opened up in two
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
years later when they could get state
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
aid so that two years I can pretty much
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
assure you there was no construction
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
going on two years later the moratorium
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
was again added for another two years so
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
schools have been in this oh no just
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
wait two more years it's not like
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
schools knew that there was a 10-year
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
moratorium so I think maybe around year
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
eight people are kind of having a hint
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
that maybe building Aid was struggling a
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
little bit and I think a few schools
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
went on to build without state aid
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
um we know Oyster River just built a
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
beautiful school
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
um there's some a few others out there
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
that built schools without state aid but
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
during that 10-year period not a lot of
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
schools built with State AIDS certainly
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
not struggling communities
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
um built during that time
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
um there was one project that was funded
 
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.289 align:start position:0%
um there was one project that was funded
through

00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 2 amended a lifted the
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
moratorium to allow this one project to
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
be funded um that was Hinsdale they had
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of emergency situation it was
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
a 3.6 million dollar project the state
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
aid portion was 2.2 million
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
um so other than that one project there
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
was a 10 years without building Aid uh
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
and then for the first time the budget
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 21 that that biennium budget
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
was the first time it was lifted
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
um building the moratorium disappeared
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
was removed from House Bill 2 for the
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
first time in 10 years and
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
um schools applied
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
thought we had a list of five schools
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
they were ranked
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
um those schools were trying to get
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
building Aid they were requesting 45
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars or their their projects
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
totaled 45 million dollars they were
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
requesting 17 million in state aid for
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
that biennium three of those projects
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
were funded
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
um the funding amount there is is there
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
as well 40 million dollars was fun uh 40
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year
 
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.130 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year
um

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.330 align:start position:0%
um
hmm

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
plus that 8.6 million uh I have to look
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
to see more Rusty apparently the total
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
projects for that was 8.6 million we'll
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
see on a chart in in on the next page
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
um so in that
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind that five projects a lot
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
of people would have asked why did only
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
five schools apply when you had this
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
10-year moratorium why didn't you have
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
more schools apply well you have to
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
apply for building Aid a year ahead of
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
time and we were in a moratorium and I'm
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
pretty sure most of the schools that
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
applied really were very surprised that
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
they got building Aid and so you can see
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
building Aid was lifted and in 2022 and
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
2023 that biennium we had 12 schools
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
apply now what's interesting is you have
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
to apply keep in mind fiscal 22 actually
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
starts in 2021 right July 1st of 2021
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
you have to apply a year in advance so
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about July of 2020 so
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
now we're deep in a pandemic so now the
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
laboratorium has been lifted but we have
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
schools applying during the moratorium I
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
mean during the pandemic so again 12
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
schools did apply
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
we had in January
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
so January of 2020
 
00:31:50.529 --> 00:31:50.539 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic sort of January 2020
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's part of the law requires
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
um you to notify the Department of
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
Education if you're going to apply it's
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
called the letter of intent we had 50
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
schools in January of 2020 tell us that
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
they were going to apply for building
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
Aid by the time the application process
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
rolled around which was July of 2020
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
much much different schools were doing
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
lots of things other than applying for
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
building Aid and 12 schools put in
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
applications so just again thinking
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
about this list isn't necessarily a
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
perfect snapshot of who would be
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
applying for building Aid and then this
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
past more uh this passed by any well
 
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.169 align:start position:0%
past more uh this passed by any well
this

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
biennium coming we had 17 schools apply
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
and they applied last year they were
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
ranked and we just realized that of
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
those 17 schools the budget includes
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
enough to fund three of them
 
00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:43.010 align:start position:0%
enough to fund three of them
um

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
I put TBD there but I guess we will soon
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
have a signature and no so
 
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:51.260 align:start position:0%
um but it looks like three schools will
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
receive funding through that process
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing I'll mention I
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
think that's important to note is that
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in 2023 in the middle of the
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
moratorium because the moratorium starts
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
in 2010. in 2013 the law drastically
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
changes it says there's a big revision
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
of the law and it said we're no longer
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
going to fund projects on demand well on
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
demand meaning we're no longer going to
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
fund all the projects instead we're
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
going to make it a competitive process
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to Cap building Aid at 50
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.850 align:start position:0%
million dollars
um

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
um we were also at that time in 2010
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
spending about 60 million dollars a year
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
in building Aid so at that time there
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
was a cap put on a 50 million dollars in
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
building Aid and um what happens when
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
you have a cap is it now becomes a
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
competitive process and so now in order
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
to figure out who gets that money
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
there's a whole ranking process that's
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
in involved and you mentioned some of
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
those the security
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
um unsafe conditions either structural
 
00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:02.419 align:start position:0%
issues mechanical issues Plumbing issues
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
educational space suitability issues
 
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.050 align:start position:0%
educational space suitability issues
overcrowding

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:08.060 align:start position:0%
overcrowding
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
consolidation all of those things that
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
you now get points for
 
00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
you now get points for
which

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.230 align:start position:0%
which
um

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
leads to one of the biggest problems of
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
that ranking is that you get all these
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
points for really big projects right so
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to put in let's say a
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
security vestibule or if you wanted to
 
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:31.460 align:start position:0%
add an addition for to expand a program
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
those smaller projects are hard to get
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
building aid for because you're not
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
checking all of those boxes like a brand
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
new school would or if you're
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
consolidating schools those projects
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
also score really high as well
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
um not that those aren't worthy projects
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
but that is kind of what flushes out is
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
all those new schools or consolidation
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
projects float to the top and some of
 
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:56.300 align:start position:0%
the smaller projects don't
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh and the next page is really just the
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
rates if you were thinking about like
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
who what rates does my um
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
areas have my towns have those are the
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
rates right there the billing Aid rates
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
um this graph especially because if
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about funding it
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
differently one of the
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
um items on your list was whether you
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
want to think about continuing that 80
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
percent model or paying over the tail I
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
didn't really talk about that much but
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
prior to 2013 if you recall I said the
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
law changed drastically prior to 2013
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
the state paid on the term of the bond
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
so if you got a 10 million dollar award
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
and you were a 20-year Bond you would
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
get a half a million dollars every year
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
for 20 years
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
in 2013 that changed you already
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned it and now you get the award
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
up front to get 80 percent of your award
 
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
prior to construction 20 upon completion
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
so we're done paying within two to three
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
years or however long it takes for the
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
project so when you hear the word tale
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is what they're talking about I
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
suppose it does look like a tail
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
um this tale is the obligated payments
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
on those Bond payments we were making
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
prior to 2000 for projects prior to 2013
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
which really are projects prior to 2010
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
since we didn't fund any anything from
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
2010 to 2013.
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you can see it goes all the way out
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
to 2041 that's actually a 30-year bond
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
that didn't start until 2011 those are a
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
couple of the final schools that were
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
applied in 2009 and by the time they got
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
their financing so that's where those
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
2041 so in 2041 the tale will be gone
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
unless the Law changes and adds a new
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
tail so
 
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.329 align:start position:0%
tail so
um

00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
so with that I feel like that's a quick
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
summary if there's anything else you
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
want me to hit specifically on the
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
summary piece of things
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions yes or need
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
from further information yes uh looking
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
at the chart on your summary page I'm
 
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.630 align:start position:0%
at the chart on your summary page I'm
interested

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh 20 20 22 23. we said this there were
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
12 applications for new projects
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
and two are funded is that correct two
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
were funded that's correct now is that
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that two that were funded did that
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
take up the available funding that was
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
in the budget at that time it it did if
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
you actually um if you look on that
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
graph as well
 
00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:48.770 align:start position:0%
graph as well
um

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that was 22.23
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
um what interestingly if you if so if
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
you look on this graph of 22 and 23 ish
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
those solid bars are the tail obligated
 
00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:02.450 align:start position:0%
those solid bars are the tail obligated
payments

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
um the state also took out a bond in
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
2010 to meet a shortfall that they had
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
so that there's the bond payment as well
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
on there but the dashed lines are the
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
new project payments and so in 22 and 23
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
let me actually was that
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
so 22 and 23
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
um the state actually stacked the
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation from you can see in 2023
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
no money so this current year we were
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
given no money for building Aid instead
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
they over paid extra in 2022 so that 30
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
million went to those two projects and
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
actually one project was fully funded
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the second project was
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh the second project I'm going to guess
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
we shorted them about seven million
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
dollars from there so it didn't pay for
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
and so that meant that the State Board
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
makes these decisions they make this
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
allocation correct uh no the um the
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
legislature does we make that decision
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
so so the decision to fund just to
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh at the rate that you just indicated
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
was made rather than
 
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:27.260 align:start position:0%
funding smaller amounts to more
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
applications is that correct
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
um yes and no the the all the projects
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
those 12 projects that come in the law
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
requires that this the Department of
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
Education the state board of education
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
rank those projects if the small
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
projects ranked High because they scored
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
lots of points they just get picked off
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
from the top of the list
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the first rank project actually
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't selected because they didn't pass
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
their warrant article
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so the the next project Pastor Warren
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
article so we've gave funding to them
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
um answer your question yeah until we
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
run out of money so we picked a project
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
off paid for it who else passed their
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
warrant article yep you did offered the
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
money and then the second project we
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
offered to actually wanted more but we
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
only had whatever remaining we had for
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
them yeah
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can explain this to the
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
group so a
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
a number of schools obviously did not
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
receive funding
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
um this year
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
or in the previous go around as well
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the two or the three now if
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're one that didn't receive for
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
example let's take Concord this year so
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
their project for the state cost was
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
roughly what run as I think around
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
recall 70 million dollars thereabouts
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
and that would just kind of wipe out our
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
entire account for funding that school
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
in its entirety but if a school doesn't
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
receive in a given year are they
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
automatically put on the list at the top
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
or they have to compete against with all
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
those other projects were coming in and
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're reprioritized how's it work okay
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
so these questions are going to get a
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
little complicated because House Bill
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
452 was signed into law last month so
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
the process is now a little different
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
than the folks that are play that have
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
that on the list right now
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the department still needs to make
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
some rules on that and literally just
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
pass maybe three weeks ago
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
um but the the law used to read I'll try
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
to so what it used to say
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
um last month was that if you didn't get
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
funding if you passed your warrant
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
article but the states didn't have money
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
you could stay on the list for the next
 
00:41:47.099 --> 00:41:49.270 align:start position:0%
you could stay on the list for the next
biennium

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
but the problem with that is you know
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get money if you're
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
project number 11. so why would you even
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
ask your voters to for a vote you're
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
just wasting time so so House Bill 452
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
corrects that
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I hope that it will correct it anyway
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
I have to get down on the nitty-gritty
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
to it but
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and some of that will come with
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but the new process will be
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
that you get to stay on the list
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the vote even if you had a
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
failed vote you get to stay on the list
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
for so many years
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
um three years four years I think that
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be determined by
 
00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:25.970 align:start position:0%
that's going to be determined by
rulemaking

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
I thought 452 they could get bumped if
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's a project that came in with uh
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh some of those needs such as safety
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
Etc yes absolutely you are correct so if
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
you are a project there is one way you
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
can get bumped and is if you apply and
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
you have higher life safety points you
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
have to score more than half of the
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
points and you have to have more points
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
than people that are above you that were
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
on the list prior then you can jump
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
through jump to the top of the ranking
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
so now this new process kind of creates
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
this waiting line and it'll be
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to see how long that line
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
gets represent cascad and then represent
 
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:12.710 align:start position:0%
gets represent cascad and then represent
already

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes that's a good question so this is
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 24 and 25. this is our list
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
for this year you know how I said they
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
have to apply a year ahead of time these
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
are the schools that applied for this
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
coming but budget
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
um and the budget has passed with enough
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
funds not that they'll get funding but
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
enough funds to cover the top three
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
projects we know Rochester is prepared
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
to take funds and we know Monadnock has
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
passed their Warren article Colebrook
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
failed but they'll get one other
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so because it's a
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
biennium list
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and if they pass next year then that
 
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
correct correct yep and that would be
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
the case for everybody is this a
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
biennium list so next year the list
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't change nobody adds to it nobody
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
can apply for building Aid um it's
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
different with the new law so the next
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
two years the the list will have the
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
so um now 9 10 and 11 and I apologize if
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was your original question uh okay
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
um not page 9 10 and 11. those are our
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
those obligated payments those are our
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
projects that we're still paying on that
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
were constructed prior to 2010.
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
um those are are what we call our tail
 
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.849 align:start position:0%
um those are are what we call our tail
payments

00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
and so every year that list gets shorter
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
and shorter because we pay on the term
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the bond so every year a handful of
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
those fall off because that they made
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
their last Bond payment and that's what
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
allows that 50 million to grow so in in
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
theory in 2013 the theory was that you
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
keep that you'd pay off that tail once
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's paid off you'll have a consistent
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
50 million
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
um per year to spend not 50 million is a
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
lot different than it was in 2009 than
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
it is now but that was the
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.050 align:start position:0%
 
projects

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
then they still apply for a new project
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
two years in the past I know there's
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
still in somewhere in the field house
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
but should we start the process all over
 
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
again or if they can even move forward
 
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.130 align:start position:0%
again or if they can even move forward
with

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.690 align:start position:0%
with
it

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:52.700 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so everybody that's not on the list
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
of 17 this 24-25 list that's all of the
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
people that are on the list right now
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who know who's not will need to
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
apply for building Aid if they're
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
interested there's no other list however
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
this list of payments that doesn't
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
preclude people from applying for
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
building a just because Littleton or any
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
other District got building Aid they can
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
still apply for another school or for
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know another project but what
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
building Aid does it's um
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's also important to remember that
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
everybody is playing by the same set of
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
rules so even even conquered I know
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
people don't always want to think so but
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
when they when they're requesting uh
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
realize this isn't your question but
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
when they're requesting 76 million that
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're eligible for
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
20 for I mean I'm sorry if they're
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
requesting 76 million it's important to
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
remember that that doesn't mean that
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for 76 million they are
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
eligible per square footage per student
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
cost per square foot the same as any
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
other project
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so with that said that there is a
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
caveat in building Aid is that you can't
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
we are not going to pay for space that
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
was just touched and paid for with
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid in the past 40 years I
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
think the rule actually says 35 years so
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
the thought was they could apply in 35
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
years by the time they're actually
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
constructing it would be 40 years so
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
essentially the goal is to not be paying
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
for a space that received building Aid
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
in the last 40 years so anybody on this
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
list for a very specific project
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
I happen to be at the top of the list
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
Amherst they did a renovation for these
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
these particular spaces we have on
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
record you don't see it here but we have
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
on record on our end how much square
 
00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:46.339 align:start position:0%
footage that those schools worked on
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
those areas are prohibited from
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
receiving building Aid again for 40
 
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
years and if they wanted to
 
00:47:59.410 --> 00:47:59.420 align:start position:0%
take those schools and
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to take those spaces and
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
move to a brand new building we would
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
allow we would allow them to do that but
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
we would deem all of those Square
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
footages ineligible for Billy Eid their
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
spaces would essentially be prorated
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
so they could still move we just
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay for those spaces for the
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
new construction piece of it with the
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
thought that the states
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
the buildings that they're building
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
should be lasting at least 40 years
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
if a school was on the initial eligible
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
list didn't make it and it's still there
 
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.250 align:start position:0%
list didn't make it and it's still there
um

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
and they were ranks I think number eight
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
and then in the new process the new 400
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
legislation coming in
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
we had to replay again
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
where they carry over the state number
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
eight I guess I guess my question is
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
does the ranking drop because new uh
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
School applications they're ranked
 
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.589 align:start position:0%
School applications they're ranked
higher

00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
but there were eight before and I
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
dropped to 18th or do they still stay at
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
eight something else goes below them
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
they now still stay at eight
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
unless a school a new school applies and
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
they have scored more than half the life
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
safety points and they have more life
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
safety points than the people on the
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
list than they can jump so you have to
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
score a lot of
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
um life safety uh they're actually
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
called unsafe condition unsafe condition
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
points you have to score more than half
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
of them and if you score more than half
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
of them that you're unsafe and you can
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
jump number eight
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
um all the way to somebody else who
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't have as many life safety points
 
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:52.460 align:start position:0%
as you do or unsafe condition points
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
so taking that one point then that the
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
life safety uh points as you scale your
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
applications that would be the most
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
critical party upgrade correct I think
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
um of a fou that's a thousand points
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
they can score and I think the unsafe
 
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.089 --> 00:50:16.099 align:start position:0%
know how to score your application
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
and in the just for a clarifying
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
question in the or just to clarify in
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
the case of Littleton Littleton applied
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
for an intent to fund but they didn't
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
file an actual application so they were
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
never ranked and that was similar with
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
many people who applied during that time
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
and and I know that they are getting
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
ready to apply again is that for their
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
Elementary School the two-story building
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah and and it is also
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
important like that's really important
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
that when you're thinking about a new
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
process that building us new school is a
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
long process it's not something that you
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
can just all of a sudden be like we need
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
to you know there's a lot of vetting
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
what the community wants it's a really
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
long process
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
when you talk about uh you corrected me
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
once when we were doing the 452 or you
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
know there and I was using the wrong
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
figure for for square feet per pupil I
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
was using just solely the classroom
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
figure I think that's around 300 per
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
pupil roughly
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so what is it for the entire facility
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
with everything else yeah it's about
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
150. it's it varies but it varies high
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
school elementary big school little
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
school but in general it's about 150
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
square feet per student for the entire
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
facility or is on top of the classroom
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
space now for the entire facility 150
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
square feet yeah you could take the
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment of any school multiply it by
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
150 square feet per student and you
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
would get their approximate size now
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
you would get the approximate size that
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for building Aid
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
um okay more so schools are probably
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
building a closer to 180 square feet per
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
student some schools are even up to 200
 
00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:03.619 align:start position:0%
square feet per student
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
special education spaces drive that some
 
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
schools have really strong let's just
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
say music programs and so they have an
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
orchestra room and a violin room those
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
those spaces aren't those are above and
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
beyond awesome that they have those
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
spaces they're just not qualify for
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
those minimums special education spaces
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
are certainly something that this
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee might want to or at least for
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
rule making anyway we'll be taking a
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
look at I guess it's actually outside
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
the law but
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
um is those special education spaces
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
what those needs are in schools
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a little bit confused you're
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
saying I had on this sheet right here
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
144 square feet
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's about right yeah uh but what is
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
the cost of that square foot yeah that
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
cost of that square footage is a right
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
now we're running about about
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
550 a square foot so I think so we also
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
Cap Construction costs and that's where
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
I think the difference was between your
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
numbers and mine so construction costs
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
are capped um we we track the costs that
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
um a public school project uses or um
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
submits receipts for and then we cap
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
those based on a National Standard index
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire even indexed down to
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
the county
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
um and so those are about construction
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um envelope actual
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
construction of the building
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that's about varies but about 220
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
dollars a square foot and that doesn't
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
include engineering fees architect fees
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
site development Furniture fixtures
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
equipment things like that I mean it
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't include uh
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
an elevator if you had an elevator in
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
your building so things like that
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
correct now it's eligible for building
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
Aid which is what that 550 dollars per
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
square foot is we just have a cap very
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
specific on construction costs
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
um but there are caps on land too it's
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
just it's done per acre
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and at the rate the market value rate
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do that Manchester's
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
property is much different than and you
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
can't really cap it by County so it's
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
really what the market value is and then
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
we allow so many acres per per student
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
you can it is eligible for building Aid
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
correct yeah are these national
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
standards you're talking about correct
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
um National Construction standards uh
 
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's an industry-wide the the manuals
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they put out you can look them up
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
for a hospital you can look them up by
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
gas stations elementary school middle
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
school high school
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
um it's RS means it's a national
 
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.130 align:start position:0%
um it's RS means it's a national
standard

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative represent Luna
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
if I may focus on Charter Schools sure
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
yeah you may not be able to answer this
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I have um towel bear is here too
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
he's a charter school administrator from
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education let me give
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
with a grant of let's say a million
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
dollars from the federal government
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
there's some private money that comes in
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
to help start that school
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to purchase a
 
00:55:30.359 --> 00:55:31.849 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to purchase a
bill

00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
so the combination of
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
the startup fees private fees and let's
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
say in this instance even some State
 
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.250 align:start position:0%
say in this instance even some State
money

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
they purchase a building they renovate
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
and they get it ready for school they
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
take on a mortgage
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the third year let's
 
00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:55.309 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the third year let's
say

00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
there's still the mortgage on the
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
building they've got Assets in the
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
building Etc and the charter school
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
decides it goes on the end of our
 
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.010 align:start position:0%
our charging
 
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.490 align:start position:0%
our charging
[Music]

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to the assets
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
of that charter school where does it go
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming I'm assuming the charter
 
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
schools are 501c3
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
but there's some legal issues here
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
but the question would be particulars
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
begin to look at uh State contributions
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
as well as Federal competitions you're
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
creating this asset now we've got a
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
building here the school's now going to
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
be gone
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
what happens to that asset who's
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for the uh mortgage of it
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
that's still outstanding as well as the
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
assets that have been put in from the
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
federal government and the state
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
government is issues what happens to
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
that asset at that point
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll let tile come on up and then I
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
guess I'll just point out from the
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
building Aid perspective
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I can talk a little bit more
 
00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.730 align:start position:0%
um you know I can talk a little bit more
about

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that part of it but on building Aid
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
does have a requirement a penalty it
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
requires the school payback the full
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
amount of the award if they change uses
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
within in 20 years I realize your
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
question is more about how you get that
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
that money so there is a requirement for
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
schools public schools anybody who
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
applies for billing Aid receives billing
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
Aid to pay it back if they change uses
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
within the 20-year period Then I do
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
believe representative Mooney's um Bill
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
did have some proposal for that
 
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
if there's Federal moneys involved in
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
that how does that I understand the
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
state I mean reimbursement yeah I was a
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
federal money yep so um for again for
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
all our applications what we do is when
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
they um fill out their
 
00:57:59.809 --> 00:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
um their application there's a couple
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
application processes that they go
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
through they make estimates
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
um during the initial period but then in
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
the final when they're getting ready to
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
get that last 20 percent of their award
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
or their final payment they have to
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
submit a full statement of all of their
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
um Grant all of their statements and on
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
that we subtract out any kind of federal
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
funding that they receive so building
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
Aid is paid on the the so if you think
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
about the project total and then we
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
subtract out the federal portion that
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
they get and pay state aid based on the
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
remaining portion we we change that
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
remember we were the the grant if for
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
example it was which generated that
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
concern from superintendent Taylor the
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
state and grant money
 
00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:48.650 align:start position:0%
state and grant money
is

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
taken out they can use the gift money
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
but they can use the for their local
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
match so if you're thinking about the
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
state match and then the local match
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
um federal dollars you cannot use for
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
your local match you can now with a
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
passage of 452 use gifts a donations for
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
your local match but federal dollars you
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
cannot so it comes off the top we don't
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
they can't use it for their local share
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
Dave did you have
 
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.410 align:start position:0%
Dave did you have
okay

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:20.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
good afternoon towel bear with the
 
00:59:24.049 --> 00:59:24.059 align:start position:0%
charter school office and hopefully I
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
will not confuse this issue any more
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
than it appears it might be
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it's a complicated answer
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
um because it really depends on where
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
the funds come from specific to the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
charter school so if you've got
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
restricted uh donations to a charter
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
school if it if it dissolves then those
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions would come into play if
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
they're federal funds that were used in
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
the operation of that charter school
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
then you're going to be dealing with
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines and then depending on
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
the amounts of those funds or items or
 
00:59:52.799 --> 00:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
the amounts of those funds or items or
assets

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
assets
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
um it kind of drives it in a different
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
direction than into the state funds
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's a whole a whole nother kettle of
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
fish so I do think it's a it's a more
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
complicated issue than just simply
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're dissolving what happens and then
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
lastly I would add I would assume with
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
the if you have a bank they're the lien
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
holder on the property
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I would assume that the bank would be
 
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
the owner of that property and would
 
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to pay pending I I'd be shocked if
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
they would do some kind of first I
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
forget the legal term but where
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
I used to be in Mortgage Banking and you
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
didn't you were always the first lien
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
holder and if the loan ever failed we
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
always got our money back first so I
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
don't know how that works at the at
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
least here in New Hampshire I just know
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
back home that was kind of how we
 
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
back home that was kind of how we
operated

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
by what you're saying there needs to be
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
some clarification on how that's going
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
to be handled I I do think there should
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
be some color clarification the other
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
and just along the same lines just
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
pointing out that the draft Bill also
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
included a different payment schedule
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
again the bill well it's you guys are
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
talking about it today so obviously
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's why it's here but the the payment
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill talks about breaking up
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
payments not giving it all up front and
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
then paying upon completion instead it's
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
giving 20 of it every year for five
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
years I think that was another way to
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the state held on to some
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
of those that money under that same
 
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.089 align:start position:0%
of those that money under that same
concern

01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
can I get something I just would also
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
add something for consideration
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about school
 
01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:45.109 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about school
buildings

01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
um the size of Traditional School
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
buildings many of these Charter Schools
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
could be you know 300 to half million I
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we have charter schools with three to
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
five million dollar buildings that's
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
kind of a rare exception most of their
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
buildings are fairly small
 
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's a charter conversion school work
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
into this if I'm a public school
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
district I say oh I'm going to become a
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
charter conversion School my school
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
board is still there it's owned by the
 
01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.890 align:start position:0%
board is still there it's owned by the
municipality

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
how's that work in conjunction with this
 
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.910 align:start position:0%
how's that work in conjunction with this
law

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
um so under building Aid you can the
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
district the school district can just
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
apply for building Aid because they're
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
the owners if I if I'm understanding
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
your question right that the school
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
district can still apply for building
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
aid for those
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
um District spaces
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
so the school board no longer has a
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
rigor Public School it has a public
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
charter conversion School
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not the school board has a
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
district approved Charter which it's a
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
separate process that they would
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
essentially get their Charter approved
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
through their local district and their
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
Town process once that's completed then
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
the state does the final side off but
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
yeah it would it would be a separate
 
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.530 align:start position:0%
yeah it would it would be a separate
process

01:02:59.530 --> 01:02:59.540 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to re-look at 194b but I
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
believe the pro so again building Aid is
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
set up to allow charter schools to apply
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
for Aid it's 194b in the charter school
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
law that prevents them from applying but
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
I do believe 195 194b allows District
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
conversion schools to apply for building
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
Aid we just do we have any of those no
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
you don't we don't so we've always just
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
said oh they're not eligible because
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's none available but if it was
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
that type of charter school then they
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
would they would still they would be
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
able to apply for building Aid under the
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli and then
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you thank you
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
Mr bear um go ahead I'm sorry no it's
 
01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:45.410 align:start position:0%
Mr bear um go ahead I'm sorry no it's
okay

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
I think

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
um maybe last term the application
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
process for a charter school was revised
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that it had to include a dissolution
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
plan if they owned their own building is
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
is part one is that correct
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
partially all of them have to include a
 
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
dissolution plan regardless of building
 
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.010 align:start position:0%
dissolution plan regardless of building
ownership

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.569 align:start position:0%
ownership
and

01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
follow up if yes go ahead um I think in
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
this bill there is a provision so that
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
if a building is improved or constructed
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
During the period
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
um that they have to have that plan in
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
place but it should already be there as
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
part of their application process that
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:37.010 align:start position:0%
is that correct
correct

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um going back to um to representative
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
miler's question I think also what
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
was also you know uh referencing to I
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could talk a little
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
bit about how that how the clawback
 
01:05:01.089 --> 01:05:01.099 align:start position:0%
um uh policy Works uh in the event a um
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
a school
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
um uh that has received building Aid as
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
part of its its construction or
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
renovation costs it has that it's been
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
determined that it's being used for
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
something else you could just sort of
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
lead us through how that works how many
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
times this has happened maybe before and
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and um you know what we can expect
 
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
um it has happened I'm familiar with at
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
least three if not more cases where it's
 
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.309 align:start position:0%
least three if not more cases where it's
happened

01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
um the law says that the penalty
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
um is paid back but there's some
 
01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:39.619 align:start position:0%
discretion at the commissioner's level
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh at the department of education's
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
level and what the department did at
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
that time is that we just prorated so
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
one of the schools closed at like 18
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
years and so essentially we just did it
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind that we used to pay on
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
the the term of the bond so it was much
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
easier under that old model to just say
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
well you're closing we're not going to
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
pay any more building Aid we don't
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
actually have to get any money back from
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
them we just stopped paying them in all
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
three cases we did that in all three
 
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.450 align:start position:0%
three cases we did that in all three
cases

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
um they were at the at the very end of
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
their time and then um of course A lot
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
of times
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
um you know your Club Elementary School
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
in Berlin and just closed I think that
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
might have been one of them that had you
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
know had done some small work
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
um it's diff it would be really
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
difficult in that situation to be like
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
oh pay that five million dollars back
 
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.849 align:start position:0%
oh pay that five million dollars back
right

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
um so in that case we just stopped
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
payment and it is a good thought for
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
this group now thinking about what
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
happens if we're giving all of that
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
money up front the 80 up front and 20
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
upon completion it's definitely a lot
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
um to get money back
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
so and and a follow-up on that
 
01:06:56.039 --> 01:06:57.529 align:start position:0%
so and and a follow-up on that
so

01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:57.539 --> 01:06:59.089 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
so would a
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I guess you know would it would a
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
would a change of use
 
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.410 align:start position:0%
would a change of use
include

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.430 align:start position:0%
include
um

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
the building being used for a school
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
district and then maybe the building
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
being used for some other
 
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.089 align:start position:0%
being used for some other
um

01:07:19.089 --> 01:07:19.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
operating entity as a as a school would
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
that be a change of of use if there was
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
a change of ownership
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
um change of ownership so you know if
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
you had a school that was then turned
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
over to the YMCA and now they're
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
operating it yeah that would not be a
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
pay for YMCA so that would be a change
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
of view it would be a change of use yeah
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
you could have a school you could have a
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
K-12 school that turns it into an SAU
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
office and that also would not be that
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
would also require them to pay it back
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
because it's for 12 the law says that
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's for K-12 education
 
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you know so if they turned it into an
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
SAU office that they would be required
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
to turn that money back over okay and
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
and you you'd mentioned that in in your
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
experience the the few times this has
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
happened it's been towards the tail end
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
of a 20-year thing where
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of people's crystal
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
balls don't go out this early 20 years
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and um and we can sort of see that
 
01:08:20.289 --> 01:08:20.299 align:start position:0%
happening but have you seen any any
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
changes of use or or District failures
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh in the first you know few years you
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
know you know one two three years after
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
after a building was was either
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
constructed or substantially renovated I
 
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
have not no
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I do know that sometimes I get calls
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
from schools saying oh well we were
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
thinking about changing the space to a
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
preschool space which is not an eligible
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
building Aid cost
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and then they find out that that puts
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
them in Jeopardy of having to pay their
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
ability Aid back and they're like oh
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
that's not a good space for preschool
 
01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:57.890 align:start position:0%
that's not a good space for preschool
then

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
um it's really pretty easy for decision
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you they can request a waiver you
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
know consideration from the Department
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
the law does allow that
 
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.209 align:start position:0%
the law does allow that
um

01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
to shifting spaces in something like a
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
preschool might make sense we always
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
tell the districts if it makes sense
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
approach us because you know we want to
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
make some good decisions for the
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
district but they are wise to make um
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
that call because the law does say K-12
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
education great thank you Amy
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative dry and then
 
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:37.100 align:start position:0%
going back to 194 B 11
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
um there will be no school building
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
awarded to a chartered public school but
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's that Clause at the end of the
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
sentence that says unless the building
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
is owned by the school district under
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
lease to the chartered public school and
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
such lease does not include an option to
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
purchase the building this is different
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
than a charter conversion school is that
 
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
than a charter conversion school is that
correct

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
do you want I don't I I don't know the
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
way I've when I've read that um before
 
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.610 align:start position:0%
way I've when I've read that um before
um

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
um is that I have always been that is
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
when the school district owns that space
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the charter school is leasing that
 
01:10:19.209 --> 01:10:19.219 align:start position:0%
space is that also a conversion school
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay this is simply a tennis so for me
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
that that law has always been confusing
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
to me because I'm like it wouldn't be
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
the charter school that would be
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
applying for it anyway it would be the
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
school district so they could apply for
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
those spaces and follow up are there
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
schools that fit that unless Clause okay
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't believe so do you
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
there there are some charter schools
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
that at least from uh Public Schools
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
here I can think of two offhand
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up so then they
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
would be eligible to apply for building
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
Aid they the charter school or the
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
district that's a good question like I
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
read it it sounds like the district but
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney so so
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have always said it would be the
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
school district that would apply because
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
the charter schools are eligible for
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
lease Aid so
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
um it's
um

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not that well written but we
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
have always said it would be the school
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
district they're leasing from the school
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
district so this it would be receiving
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
an application from the school district
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
not the charter school building owner
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's a building owner
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
thanks chair a question let's go back to
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
your dissolution I meant I don't know if
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh child school property uh he said that
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
the in the doe I think what you said was
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
in the doe application that process
 
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.689 align:start position:0%
in the doe application that process
identified

01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the disillusion process is going to
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
be if they have to dissolve yeah the the
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
languages they must have a dissolution
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
plan as part of their Charter
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
application each plan could be slightly
 
01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
application each plan could be slightly
different

01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
um depending on the organization but
 
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
they have to have a plan yes
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you so to to that then those
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
plans public information
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
I assume they would because they're part
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the charter application in the
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
charter application is public
 
01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
information yes thank you and does the
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
department have copies of that Charter
 
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.010 align:start position:0%
department have copies of that Charter
application

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
we do okay I'm looking at another
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
section law 194 B 16.
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and a section Romans 7 if the charter if
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
a school's Charter expires or is revoked
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
the school shall be dissolved under the
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
provisions of his Charter application
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
and contract that the contract
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions are silent or ambiguous as to
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
the disposition of any asset of the
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
school do you have any uh Charters that
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
still have that in ambiguous uh language
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
that may have required this to be
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
written that would uh cause some issues
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
in terms of the disposition of assets of
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
further questions Amy I have one for you
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's jumping off the charter school a
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
um when we look at all these 17
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
applications which we received there's
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
some that are large and some that are
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
smaller I know there's some states which
 
01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:30.260 align:start position:0%
I have several pots of money available
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
one for
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
well maybe in one for leasing one for uh
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
possibly I'll take a figure five million
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollars left less or three million
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
dollars less and then those for the
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
larger ones
 
01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
larger ones
um

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is that when we get to some
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
of these large projects and they're
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
going to come at us
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
we could end up funding just one project
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
in a period while right now right now in
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
Period of two years seeing the Tails
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
taking half of what we appropriate
 
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:05.630 align:start position:0%
taking half of what we appropriate
so

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
do you know of any states where it may
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
be working where they have several pots
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
of money where we can allocate resources
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
out depending upon the size of the
 
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.390 align:start position:0%
out depending upon the size of the
application

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I know that some have
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
different pots of money for different
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
types of projects so like if you were
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to do a
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
um a window project or a door
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
replacement project so that makes those
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
projects smaller you're talking about
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
renovation yeah renovation but
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind when for building Aid
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
you definitely wouldn't want to make a
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
pot for renovation and a pot for new
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
because the renovations when we talk
 
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:46.460 align:start position:0%
about a renovation we're talking about
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
open studs and just doing a full
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
renovation the law defines it as
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation so you're really
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
bringing up that space up to new
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
oftentimes those types of renovation
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
projects cost just as much sometimes
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
even more than a new build
 
01:15:02.219 --> 01:15:04.130 align:start position:0%
even more than a new build
um

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.450 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
in I I think if you're wanting to reach
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
more people if if you're doing that to
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
me that says that you want to reach more
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
people with the money
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
um because a lot of these brand new
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
buildings or new builds are because the
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
building itself is in really bad
 
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.050 align:start position:0%
building itself is in really bad
condition

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and so it's not that that isn't where
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
the money should focus on because those
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
are like your worst buildings usually
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
um but if you're in if you're interested
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
in pushing money out to reach more
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
people which I can see that would be a
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
big benefit as well
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider how we operate
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
lease Aid well how we operate we say it
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
is people apply for lease Aid and we
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
fund everybody on the list and that way
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're not ranking these projects
 
01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.070 align:start position:0%
you're not ranking these projects
um

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
I think that is a good thing for you all
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
to look at is like those 17 projects
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
come in we get an appropriation and we
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
you can still prorate people you can
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
still grant them an award based on more
 
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
affluent less affluent maybe even give
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
them more more percentage points for the
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
types of projects that you want to float
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
to have more
 
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:18.890 align:start position:0%
to have more
um

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
more importance and then you could just
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
prorate everybody across the list that
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
way everybody is getting a share of
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
whatever was appropriated
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
for me that solves a couple of problems
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
it solves the big problem of of schools
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
not feeling like they have to rush and
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
get a big project in they could do
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
projects in pieces a lot better they
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
could do phasing of a project a lot
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
better they can do smaller projects a
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
lot better and the department wouldn't
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
be ranking these projects so that it
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
would allow everybody to compete on a
 
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field
 
01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
legislatively doesn't give Focus onto
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
only those that are receiving the aid
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are at the top
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
um and I feel like if you've got a list
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
that everybody kind of it's not all
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
about who's on the list anymore it's
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
just a matter of those are the people
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
that are going to get Aid
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
the problem with that because I have
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
thought this through the problem with
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
that is you never know how much you're
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and you don't know how many people
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
are going to apply so one year you might
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
be prorating it 80 everybody gets 80 of
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
what they the formula shakes out to be
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
and other years you might be like oh
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
you're only going to get 30 of whatever
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
the formula shakes out to be and we say
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
that happened in Lee said one year we
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
gave everybody like 44 of what they were
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
asking for the following year the
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislature bumped that amount up and so
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
it gives a true a better in my opinion
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
it gives a better picture of what the
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
real ask is the real ask is this amount
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
and schools could still reject that
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
award like it'd be like oh I can't do it
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
if the state's only going to give me 30
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
percent of what I'm asking for
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
they could just wait and apply later you
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
know there are I think that could
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
something I I hope that you consider of
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um during this time
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
and one other question I have I'm trying
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
to dig down in my memory here and Define
 
01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.130 align:start position:0%
to dig down in my memory here and Define
renovation

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
um I somehow 25 of the cost of
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
construction rings a bell but I'm not
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
sure where is that break off between
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance and renovation
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're referring to is
 
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.310 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're referring to is
that

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
um in the law there is a requirement the
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
definition of substantial renovation is
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
your project has to be at least a
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
renovation project of at least five
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars or 25 of what it would
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
cost to build a new building those are
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
for those those are that law was in
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
there just for those smaller projects to
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
say well five million dollars might be a
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot for what the little schools so maybe
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
they have to meet something smaller so
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's 25 percent of whatever is new
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
um that would define a substantial
 
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.770 align:start position:0%
um that would define a substantial
renovation

01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:17.780 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance we think of Maintenance as
 
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.250 align:start position:0%
maintenance we think of Maintenance as
um

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
prepare for and you can put in your
 
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:30.980 align:start position:0%
regular school budget such as window
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
replacements roof Replacements that
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
don't aren't big Capital construction
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
projects they're expensive and building
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
a used to pay for them but those are
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
kind of your those are considered like
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
more your some people call them
 
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
renovation because they're replacing
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
their windows but in our world we'd call
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
that maintenance
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay I got one last one here
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
um sorry to everybody else but
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um we had a proposal that came forward
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
and everybody has a copy of that
 
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.490 align:start position:0%
and everybody has a copy of that
Amendment

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's a back to the pack that was handed
 
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.830 align:start position:0%
it's a back to the pack that was handed
out

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
this amendment um
 
01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
this amendment um
967h

01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
967h
 
01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:20.540 align:start position:0%
I won't say any names
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
another way of
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
paying for a classroom space
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
and it'll be an annual commitment of
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
dollars to these districts we talked
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
about this in finance
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
300 for each people in the
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities admr in grades
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grade eight 350
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
dollars for each people in the
 
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities admr in grades nine
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
through twelve
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that approach of
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
giving this blanket amount annually
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the schools for them to put into a
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
fund which is only usable for
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
if we don't change it for construction
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
of a new construction renovation
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
first first what we're doing what are
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
some shortcomings what are some of the
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
positives of it
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
well the big I think the definitely the
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
positive of it is it targets it just
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
gives everybody some money
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
to allocate to what it might cost them
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
um for somebody who just built something
 
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's great because they're going to
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
get they're going to get some extra
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
money that they probably never think
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
that they're ever going to see anyway it
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
just essentially distributes money cost
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
per pupil to school districts
 
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:38.990 align:start position:0%
per pupil to school districts
um

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem is that I think this
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
is designed so that you collect a little
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
bit of money each year per student and
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
you are responsible and save it which I
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the ideal world I think that that's a
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
great option
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
um but if that was in place 50 years ago
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
and there was some restrictions on it
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
then 50 years now we would have some
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
money so unless somebody's willing to
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
um my estimates is about 10 billion
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
dollars into a an account so that people
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
can start getting the savings that they
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
should have had 50 years ago per pupil
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the life of the account then
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's the shortcoming the
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
shortcoming is that there's no money
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
right now for people to do construction
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
projects and there won't be for 40 years
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
um the way the law that house bill is
 
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.350 align:start position:0%
um the way the law that house bill is
written

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.270 align:start position:0%
written
um

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are good things about it
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna say um I'm from
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and back home we have a
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
similar program each and this has been a
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
few years but each Charter School
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
essentially has a facilities credit per
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
year per student that used to be in the
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
1500 to 2 000 range and then
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
those those credits
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
um saved up each year actually became
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
the down payment for many of those
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
charter schools to purchase buildings
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
um and then also maintain the existing
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
facility they were in
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
um that became a springboard for
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
building ownership for charter schools
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
which if you were to look at a charter
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
school the two biggest expenses they
 
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:17.060 align:start position:0%
have are typically lease and salary
 
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
many of them can never get out of the
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
cycle of purchasing a building because
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
they can't save enough money to buy a
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
building so those lease credits excuse
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
me those facilities credits served a
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
purpose and they allowed charter schools
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
to accumulate enough money
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
to acquire a down payment so they could
 
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
eventually buy a building so it it works
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I'd say if you if the if the state
 
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
were to move forward with this then it
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
might run well in tandem with a program
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that it's ready in 40 years to be
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
used and it doesn't have to be 40 years
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
I mean people could cash in their
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
credits I would also use them as credits
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
so that that money just doesn't kind of
 
01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.570 align:start position:0%
so that that money just doesn't kind of
disappear

01:23:58.570 --> 01:23:58.580 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
but you know somebody might want to tap
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
into it in 20 years for time and use it
 
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:07.460 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
should the we if if we venture down this
 
01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
should the we if if we venture down this
road

01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
do you think it's fair to say that all K
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
through eights are going to get 300
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
bucks all high schools are going to get
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
350 bucks or should there be other
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
criteria that come into the mix
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
such as property wealth or or isolation
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
or you know demographic
 
01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:33.229 align:start position:0%
or you know demographic
um

01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I think that's 100 a policy
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
question I mean it's not the Department
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
of Education really doesn't have a role
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
in that I I think
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
um whatever you all decide of where that
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
money should be distributed
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
um My Hope Is that I come up you you
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
come up with a process that will allow
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
schools to have a functioning and you
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
know probably even more importantly a
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
way to plan like what what is there what
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
can they plan for if it's ten percent
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's ten percent if it's 40 it's 40 but
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and if it's nothing it's nothing but
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think some kind of process
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
um that schools can
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
um work with is really important I'm
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
sure if school is sitting here they
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
would be like oh zero percent is not
 
01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:23.330 align:start position:0%
would be like oh zero percent is not
okay

01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
um so maybe I should take that back a
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
little bit but
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I think it will be really helpful for
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
right now building Aid is just really
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
volatile it's like some money no money
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
maybe some money maybe enough for one
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
school maybe not for three schools it's
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
just it's
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of a roller coaster
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
because there because that cap is a
 
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
maximum cap not a minimum cap and
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know sometimes I wonder if there
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
should even be a cap um I don't know if
 
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
it hinders or at all but
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
versus changing it to a minimum or a
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
maximum I don't know it it's uh I don't
 
01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:04.340 align:start position:0%
know that money thing is hard because
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
money's hard to
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
to dedicate so
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah just just one years in
 
01:26:16.139 --> 01:26:17.330 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah just just one years in
lines

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
been provided capacity to access to
 
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.550 align:start position:0%
been provided capacity to access to
resources

01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
could you say again what what that
 
01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:43.450 align:start position:0%
could you say again what what that
um

01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
again this and this would have been a
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
decade or more ago but it was somewhere
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
between fifteen hundred and two thousand
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars on facilities I don't know if
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
they've changed it or if it had
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
graduating amounts we just we had a
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
building of 50 000 square feet and I
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
remember that number as our set
 
01:27:14.410 --> 01:27:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
basis and is there a way that we we can
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
get maybe a
 
01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:25.460 align:start position:0%
you know a summary of If that program
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
I could reach out to my counterparts in
 
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
on a harder basis on a public school
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
going back to Washington DC
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
um in Kentucky they're required they've
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
sort of a similar program but they also
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
have what they cost First first nickel
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
and that means that the district has to
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
put some money in the kitty before
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to collect their credits
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
so there's sort of kind of some
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
ownership in this uh would anything like
 
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
that be existing in Washington where you
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
came from or not that I'm aware of um
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I I'll actually do a little bit of
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
digging both in Washington DC but also
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
reach out to the National Charter School
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
resource center and see what other
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
states are doing with this specific
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
issue thank you Rick on on that very
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
um issue I think that's very interesting
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
because you know that's uh it's getting
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
us out of the first and last dollar into
 
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.750 align:start position:0%
us out of the first and last dollar into
glasses

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
to get to the rest of the way yeah and
 
01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a model for um for building
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
Jen can you do some research with us
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
please and get us all that information
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
you gave me you funneled some
 
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
information about Kentucky to me can you
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
hit all those links and trying
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and with the education
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
Commission in the states I think that's
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
where you got it
 
01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
where you got it
yeah

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
any further need from the Department
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
I know it Amy uh you have
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
um I know you have thoughts on
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
on the lease program and some of these
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
other Ventures as far as funding
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
um do you think you could put some of
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
that together for us
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
you know in in uh because we want to
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
look at this thing seriously and figure
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
out how we can support both their
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
Charters and how we can support the
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
public schools that are needing this Aid
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
with the limited dollar we have is still
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
we will be losing this tail here shortly
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
in about another five years or so a good
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
part of the table so that means there's
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more than just 50
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars available per year maybe
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
as much as 75 80 million dollars
 
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
so that's that's something to look
 
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
forward but I'm happy to do that thank
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming today
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
is there any more discussion from the
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
committee on this we'll we'll get some
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
of this research in and what we hope to
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
do is come back in the fall we're we're
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
not going to be my meeting during the
 
01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:18.980 align:start position:0%
months of July and August
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
but we will come back and school billing
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
Aid will be a topic which we address in
 
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.610 align:start position:0%
Aid will be a topic which we address in
September

01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll meet then at the call of the
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.669 align:start position:0%
so we'll meet then at the call of the
chair

01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:30:28.679 --> 01:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
chair
yeah

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
anything else for today
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:46.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
30. it really it gives down that's my
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
you can be done with
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
committee I won't keep you very long I
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
know you are sort of heading out the
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
door there and that stopped the last
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
minute my name is Bob best I'm an
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
attorney at Sullivan Hollis and I'm on
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
the board of a couple of charter schools
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
and also on the board of a New Hampshire
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
Charter School Foundation which is sort
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
of intended to be a organization that
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
brings together some of the knowledge
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
base that different charter schools have
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
gained over the years to help some of
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
the newer younger charter schools get
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
their feet under them very well and I
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
just like to offer up whatever answers
 
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
or discussion that can be had on behalf
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
of charter schools to some of the
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions that you that you had about
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
how the building works or how what
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
happens if a charter school fails and
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
then it's building and that sort of
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
thing some of those things are outlined
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
already in statute pretty well and we
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
just point out where they are for you
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I think the discussion earlier today
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that there's a lot
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
going on with building Aid and it's not
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
just about including Charter Schools it
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
seems like there's lots of moving pieces
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
and I hope that however that progresses
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
that Charter Schools just remain sort of
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion and involved in
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
whatever that solution is so that we
 
01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
could have the opportunity to
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
participate in that in that eight going
 
01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.090 align:start position:0%
participate in that in that eight going
forward

01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
um that said I know there's a lot of
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
questions about how many schools on
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
their buildings and why and what that
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
history might have been and what happens
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
to buildings when charter schools go up
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
or down
 
01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
um didn't have to be a discussion today
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
I know that you guys have had kind of a
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
full discussion already but in the
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
future when you come back in the fall
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly come visit again and be
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
available to you or you could reach out
 
01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
to me or to the New Hampshire Charter
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
School foundation and we could Supply
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
any written information you'd want in
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
the interim and we'd be a resource for
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
you do you have a business card you can
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
share with the committee oh let's see
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
I do I mean it's my business from the
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
law firm it's not from the foundations
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
or the charter schools but I can get a
 
01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
phone number on the right you get you
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
got it it does great
 
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
about schools that have not succeeded
 
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
about schools that have not succeeded
sure

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:27.810 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
I I don't have anything like that
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
prepared but I'd be happy to work with
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
towel on that I think he's got a lot of
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
the resources and we'd certainly help
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
um pull the charter schools to find out
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing and how they've
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
been doing with things
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I haven't fortunately knocked on
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
what's been involved in any of the
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
schools that have not succeeded so I
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the what the
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
circumstances were that led them to that
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
I know that historically the statute in
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that um that authorizes
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools originally didn't allow
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
any debt uh from by the charter schools
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
and then that was amended but in the
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
beginning that's why most Charter
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
Schools don't own their buildings
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
because they weren't allowed to have any
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
death and then when that was changed
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
then you can have debt and borrow and
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
buy buildings but the uh the lease Aid
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
was a strong motivator to stay in the
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
rental market and so a lot of charter
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
schools did that and that's why I think
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
the number I was surprised that that
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
tell said it was seven I thought it was
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
more like two or three that owned their
 
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.010 align:start position:0%
more like two or three that owned their
buildings

01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:24.020 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's growing because it's becoming more
 
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
viable but for a long time the playing
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
field was tilted towards renting and
 
01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
that's why there's so many that rent
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much anything else
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's b-e-s-d that's right okay thank you
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%

going to do is we're going to break till
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
September but in the interim we're going
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
to be doing research so we may be giving
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
