00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
program over the last couple of years
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
as you know we have received three
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
federal apprenticeship grants
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that work has really taught us uh
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um shannon the next slide
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
but here's the foundation of how we do
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the well coordinated there
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
are things that happen at our system
 
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
are things that happen at our system
office

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
that essentially free up our seven
 
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
that essentially free up our seven
colleges

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
so the system office among other things
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
provides the payroll side of things the
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
benefits the grant administration
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
legal or auditing functions and so on so
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
that the colleges aren't duplicating
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
this as you know our colleges range in
 
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.070 align:start position:0%
this as you know our colleges range in
size

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
from institutions that serve
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
approximately a thousand students to
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
up to about five thousand uh students
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
on the credit uh side of the house we're
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
also structured so that we literally
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
have one
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh federal income tax number
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
and all of our collective bargaining
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
agreements emanate from
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
the system office they have
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
representation from people at the
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
colleges but we have
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
one collective bargaining agreement for
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
our full-time faculty
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
there's another one for our part-time
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
faculty and a third for our staff but
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
whether you're at river valley community
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
college or manchester community college
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
it's the same collective bargaining
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
agreement that determines
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
the work we also house the
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
administrative structure for programs
 
00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
administrative structure for programs
that

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
apply across the state at the system
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
office running start
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
is a great example as are all of the
 
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
is a great example as are all of the
federal

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
grants that we have as a system
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
and then finally some of the
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
other work at the system office has to
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
do with helping to identify
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
industry sectors now some of that comes
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
from how our board is structured
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
you may know that there are two kinds of
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
humans on our
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
board one are folks that are public
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
members and represent different parts of
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state because we're serving the
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
entire state
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that is distinctive
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
about our board
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that there literally are seats for
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
the various industry sectors
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
in our state so there's a health care
 
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.029 align:start position:0%
in our state so there's a health care
seat

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
an information technology seat two seats
 
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
an information technology seat two seats
that

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
are union and trades other seats that
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
are business and industry
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and we also have
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
a voting member from the cte
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that we are fully connected
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that um i think
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
surprises people
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
is the age range of students at the
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
22 of our credit population is between
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
the ages of 16
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
and 20. but 78 percent of our population
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
is 21 plus with the bulk of our students
 
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
is 21 plus with the bulk of our students
being

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
25 or older i bring this up because
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
while we're looking at what's happening
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
with the demographics of
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
folks graduating from high school i want
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
you to see that
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
much of the work that we do is to serve
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
the individuals living in our
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
communities who are quite a ways out of
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
now this is just the credit side if we
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
were to bring in
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
all of the non-credit side the
 
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
all of the non-credit side the
short-term

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
training programs we actually would be
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
even older if you will because the bulk
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
of our training programs
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
serve late 20s 30s and early 40s
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
so we are serving again the residents of
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
and we do it in a way that people
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate people's schedules
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
as you can see we're more than
 
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
as you can see we're more than
two-thirds

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
part-time students so that means people
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
are coming and they're taking a couple
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
of courses
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
at a time and a small part of our
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
population is full-time
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
and in fact that probably represents
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
of the high school age you know graduate
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
recent graduates
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
within our colleges um there hasn't been
 
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.190 align:start position:0%
within our colleges um there hasn't been
a

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
survey recently but in the past when
 
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
survey recently but in the past when
we've

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
essentially asked how many of our
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
students are working the percentage
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
exceeds 85 percent
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we are the people who are dealing
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
with folks who are out working in our
 
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.069 align:start position:0%
with folks who are out working in our
communities

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
and so their needs uh really determine
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
how we are structured
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at the localness
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
giving them the opportunity to do their
 
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
giving them the opportunity to do their
education

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the communities where they are that
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
also determines what kind of programming
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
we have because we're looking at the
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
industries that supply the jobs for the
 
00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:16.230 align:start position:0%
industries that supply the jobs for the
regions

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
regions
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
that our students live in and what's
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
is to give people opportunity so we want
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
you to start with us
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
you might want to come back to us again
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
you might want to transfer
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
and about twenty percent of our students
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
transfer upon graduation
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
within a five year period another ten
 
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
within a five year period another ten
percent

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
transfer so what does that say about us
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
it says that the bulk of our work is the
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
work that you created us to
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
do which is we're serving the technical
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
and career needs of our area i've i
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
spoke to you last time and i'll just
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
underscore that what we're proudest of
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
is the social mobility
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that our students exceed
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
their parents income by up to
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh by me by an average of
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
two quintiles so
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
let me go on the next page shannon
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
so today we're going to talk about five
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
areas which we've listed below
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
to show you what it is that we're doing
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
not only financially sustainable
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
but to you know spend every penny that
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
in a conservative and and cost-effective
 
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
in a conservative and and cost-effective
way

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
so where i'm going to talk a little bit
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
about academics and student support
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
about academics and student support
programs

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
and scott is going to go through our
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
budgeting practices in i.t
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll come back and speak for a
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
minute about affordability
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
we put this quote up here this is from a
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
gentleman named
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
matt reed who writes a blog confessions
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
of a community college dean
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
and he was talking about the fact that
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of the programming or much of the
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
programming that we do is expensive
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
because it's equipment intensive or for
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
instance in the healthcare area
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
because of the expense in hosting all of
 
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
because of the expense in hosting all of
the

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
the clinical sites and the education
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
there and the fact that this is
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
expensive stuff we're not doing
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
we are offering social science classes
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
obviously because that needs to be in
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
the mix
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
but the bulk of what we're doing is in
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the areas that are listed here the
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
the industry sectors that you're very
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing on the academic
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
side you know once upon a time
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
our colleges would be looking and they
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
would each create the programs that were
 
00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:42.949 align:start position:0%
would each create the programs that were
needed

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
we realized that that's not an effective
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
way for us to do business
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned the lpn program
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
previously and i'll give you a small
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
update you know
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
we had started it at the request of the
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
home health care
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
entities throughout the state several
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
years ago we restarted the program
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
at river valley and
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
last year folks in the lakes region said
 
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.069 align:start position:0%
last year folks in the lakes region said
well

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
we need more trained
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
lpns so this january lakes region
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
began its first class for lpns well
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
we're under discussion now
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
the next location is going to be white
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
mountains community college
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
now there will come a time when we will
 
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
now there will come a time when we will
fill

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
fill
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
the need for lpns
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
the the estimate is a little bit less
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
than 3000 lpns needed
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the state and so we'll meet that
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
need at some point and we'll begin to
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
fold the program back up and it will go
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
back to its
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
home college of river valley and and we
 
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.710 align:start position:0%
home college of river valley and and we
did

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know close the lpn program because
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
we were listening to industry and the
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
industry was talking about
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
magnet hospital status i don't know
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we will rush to that place again
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
we needed to bring it back up but what
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've learned
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that if we host it at one college we
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
save money
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
on the administrative side we have a way
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure the programming is up to
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
date because
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're essentially asking a college to be
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
a center for excellence
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we're looking at is
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
course sharing
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened that was
 
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened that was
wonderful

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic is that our faculty
 
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.710 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic is that our faculty
developed

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
great facility with online learning
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
tools and we'll be able
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
to apply that
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
we have an experiment that was conducted
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
between white mountains community
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
college and lakes region
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
you know when a student i think i talked
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit about this last time when a
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
student is
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
takes a course at another college the
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
way that it comes back to their home
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
college is they'll get the credits but
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
they don't get the grade
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
well we've worked with netchie and we're
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
working with our appropriate
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
committees within our colleges and that
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
little program going
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
on right now which is a pilot for us if
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
you're a lakes region student and you
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
take the course at white mountains
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
not only are you getting the credit but
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
you're also getting the grade
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
um this is good for the student because
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
a you know a gpa that represents all the
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
college work that they've done
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
but it's also good for the employer um
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want an employer to have to
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
sort through five different transcripts
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
how a student did in a particular place
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
so um i'll call your attention for a
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
moment as we go through the slides
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see that
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
some of our points are in orange and
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
these are places where there
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
are already existing connections with
 
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
are already existing connections with
the

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
university system of new hampshire
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
so i talked a little about about program
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
and course sharing
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
the orion the realignment you'll see
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
when you look at our budget
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we tend to build up what we need to
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
when it aligns with what the industry is
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
and then when that industry changes or
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
diminishes we too
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
change along with that um
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
i would also on this slide in talking
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
about academics
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
talk about the connections that we've
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
made a few years ago for example
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
we created some pharmacy technician
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
training programs and the students who
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
went through that can sit for a national
 
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
went through that can sit for a national
certifying

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
certifying
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
exam but what we needed to do to give
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
them pathways so that they could
 
00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.669 align:start position:0%
them pathways so that they could
continue

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
is to look at that non-credit work and
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
translate it into college credit where
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
it was applicable
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
and give them a path so students for
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
instance who are in a pharmacy
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
technician program right now and pass
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
that national test
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
can apply that to a health science
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
degree at a couple of our colleges
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
and receive nine credits for students to
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
see that they already have a pathway
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
to college is a really important thing
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
at this moment
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a decline in the college
 
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a decline in the college
attending

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
attending
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
of our high school students you know
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 60
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
percent go on to college well what are
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the other 40 percent doing
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
would they benefit from a non-credit
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
training program
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
for assistance in in going into whatever
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
field it is they want to go into
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
to student support this has been a huge
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
issue for us
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in the pandemic i just saw
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
a survey this morning
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
that compared new hampshire nationally
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
and based on the survey 16
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
of students who are going to enroll
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
in four-year colleges in new hampshire
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
did not on account of the pandemic but
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
what is surprising
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
is it's 43 percent of community colleges
 
00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.270 align:start position:0%
is it's 43 percent of community colleges
or

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
students who are going to attend
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that elected to wait and the two reasons
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
that they offer
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
are the pandemic and affordability
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
well we understand the pandemic piece of
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
it because our students are the
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
essential workers
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
they are the people who are the lnas in
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh healthcare systems they are the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
retail people they are the folks
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
in construction that have added all of
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
those safety barriers
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
for all of us so we have been impacted
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
in a way that
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
community colleges typically are not
 
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.789 align:start position:0%
community colleges typically are not
typically

00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
when the economy takes a bit of a
 
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
when the economy takes a bit of a
nosedive

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
nosedive
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
enrollment at community colleges soars
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
because people need to come back
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
and retrain that's not what's happening
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
now we do anticipate and we're getting
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
ready for it
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
there'll be quite a round of federal
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
funding coming
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
as people are able to come back into the
 
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
as people are able to come back into the
workforce

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
of particular concern for us right now
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
are women
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
because of their uh situation
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh where they're taking care of their
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
family and their
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
their children so here we have
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know what are we doing to help what
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
are we doing to help advise people
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that is we've identified effective
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
pieces of technology
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
that increase our uh reach
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we continue to work using various
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
plans to help students to figure out
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
what it is that they're going to do and
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
you have a couple
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
here listed the mc career coach for
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
instance that is available
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
on all of our college websites is a
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
great place for
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
students or anyone to figure out what it
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
is that they want to do
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go on to the next slide
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
and turn you over
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
to scott who'll talk more about
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting and
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
as we go further we're happy to answer
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
more questions
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
so scott if you would take it over
 
00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:13.669 align:start position:0%
so scott if you would take it over
please

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
if you would my name is scott fields i
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
am at home
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
my family is on a different floor and
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'm in intervale new hampshire
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to talk about this
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
morning is our sustainability focus and
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
and what this is is ccsh is a lean
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial organization that
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
thrives on developing increasingly
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
efficient ways of doing business
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know this nimbleness can be found in
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh throughout our business practices and
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
some of the examples that we have here
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
this morning are
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're able to leverage what we
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
call shared services and we have that
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
centrally that allows us to manage many
 
00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
centrally that allows us to manage many
things

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
at the system office level but we also
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
take that a step further and
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
we leverage that ability in terms when
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are vacancies across
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
college campuses so we're able to fill
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
in spots and
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
allow bandwidth to absorb where these
 
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
allow bandwidth to absorb where these
vacancies

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh reside a lot of it falls within the
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
finance area
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
institutional research which is ir
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
financial aid
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
hr help desk and marketing essentially
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
what will happen is we'll have folks
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
that may reside in
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
their home bases in concord but they'll
 
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
their home bases in concord but they'll
present

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
provide financial aid directorship
 
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
provide financial aid directorship
supervision

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
at white mountains community college
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
another example
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
is in white mountains again i'm still
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
doing some of their financial functions
 
00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:31.029 align:start position:0%
doing some of their financial functions
while

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
doing things in concord for the system
 
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
doing things in concord for the system
office

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
another way that we look at our
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
financial sustainability on this is we
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
do maintain
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
small levels of reserves at the college
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and system office level
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
to provide a cushion for times of
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal stress as opposed to using it to
 
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
fiscal stress as opposed to using it to
supplement

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing operational costs that we've
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
seen about in the news
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
recently in the last couple of years uh
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
other ways that we
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
provide this is to ensure that we
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
continually think outside the box in
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
terms of how we negotiate contracts
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's health insurance whether
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's i.t whether it's just
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
vendors for facilities we always look
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
outside the box that way
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
but we also look at outside the box in
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
terms of finding other opportunities for
 
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.149 align:start position:0%
terms of finding other opportunities for
revenue

00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
currently the community college system
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
has over 15 million dollars worth
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
of grants that are managed under for 54
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
different projects and areas across the
 
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.350 align:start position:0%
different projects and areas across the
seven

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
colleges so we're constantly trying to
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
find ways to
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
extend our reach and allow our employees
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
to service our students in the best
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
possible ways
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
we do in we've increased our fundraising
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
capabilities in the last three years
 
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
capabilities in the last three years
significantly

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the last bullet point on the box to
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
the left goes exactly to what chancellor
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
hughes was
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
just saying we are still and continue to
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
work with the synergies group and the
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
to provide better leveraging power
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
economies of scale in terms of
 
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
economies of scale in terms of
purchasing

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
the three uh examples that we can give
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
our canvas kaltura
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
and zoom which will come later those are
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
contracts that are already signed right
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
now that have saved us money
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
but we continue to look at aligning
 
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
but we continue to look at aligning
contracts

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
within the it operations of both
 
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
within the it operations of both
entities

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
to see when things are aligning in order
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
to again
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
leverage that economies of scale
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
and in terms of our i.t sustainability
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
our focus is being able to expand our
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
reach and maximize
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
the impact of our personnel to improve
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and experiences
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is done by using a
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
centrally managed i.t infrastructure
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
across the entire system
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
which allows for greater efficiencies in
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
terms of things like
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
support purchasing automation and
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
managing the actual performance of the
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on maintaining the
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
assets that we have
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's hardware or software
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
because we want it to be
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
uniform across the seven schools so we
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
when we look to buy things we look to
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
buy things
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
that all seven colleges use our student
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
information system
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
our learning management system our
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
advising system
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
are all platforms that whether you're in
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
nashua concord
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
berlin or river valley the students know
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
all of that programming because it's
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
across all seven colleges so we try to
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
utilize our ability to to go forward and
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
provide sustainability in that manner we
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
also look at finding a way to
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
automate things that have been very
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
manual and very time consuming in the
 
00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:40.310 align:start position:0%
manual and very time consuming in the
past

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the two examples that we have here
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
are dynamic forms and app works which
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
are two particular programs
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
degree works takes a manual process
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
and puts it into an electronic format so
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
can it it can be routed
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently and free up time from
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
someone to have to
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
fill up things in triplicate from the
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
old days app works is a software
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
component that takes
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
manual data entry that used to take
 
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
manual data entry that used to take
weeks

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
in past processes and allows it to get
 
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:08.789 align:start position:0%
in past processes and allows it to get
it

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
get down in hours or a day so what we're
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do is be able to free up the
 
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:14.789 align:start position:0%
trying to do is be able to free up the
manpower

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
manpower
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
to do other things to support our
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
student focused mission
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
while allowing us to maintain our
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
ability to do that uh
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
and chancellor hewitt just mentioned the
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
stimulus packages what we've done is
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've really tried to strategically use
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the fundings that we've gotten from
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
cares carissa and when the american
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
rescue act funds come in what that
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
has done will allows us to bolster our
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
academic technology so we can be able to
 
00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:45.669 align:start position:0%
academic technology so we can be able to
share

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
courses online to
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
reduce our footprint in the building so
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
we can have a greater reach to our
 
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.789 align:start position:0%
we can have a greater reach to our
students

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh and again i mentioned canvas caltour
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
and zoom one slide too early but these
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
are some of the technologies that we use
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
in order to save some funds across the
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
board by working with the university
 
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
board by working with the university
system

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
again the examples on the right are just
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we've
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've done at a micro level in terms of
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
changing out some of the it
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that allows for greater
 
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that allows for greater
bandwidth

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
bandwidth
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
greater efficiencies and things of that
 
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.590 align:start position:0%
greater efficiencies and things of that
nature

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you scott so we've done all of
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
this to
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
maintain affordability and we share this
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
chart of our tuition
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
you can see from 2000 2001
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
until 2010 2011
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
we kept raising tuition
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh we came to our senses in 2011
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
and realized that we are in a
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
partnership with our students
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
and if we are going to support our
 
00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.350 align:start position:0%
and if we are going to support our
students

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
we need to have the opportunity to keep
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
tuition as affordable
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
as we can and with your help we've done
 
00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.669 align:start position:0%
as we can and with your help we've done
that

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
in fact we've only raised our tuition by
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
in ten years now this has taken a huge
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
discipline it's taken additional funding
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
from all of you
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
but it's also taken discipline on our
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
side of the house
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
and looking at where we can find
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
additional dollars to support our
 
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.470 align:start position:0%
additional dollars to support our
students

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it ranges from public partners to
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
private partners like the new hampshire
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
charitable foundation and i will call
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
out the medallion fund
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
and the work that has happened there to
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
support our students who have gone into
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the technical trades
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
and when i first went to work at
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
manchester community college
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
i was truly surprised to find out how
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
much tools cost
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that if you want to go into
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
hvac you need about
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars worth of tools you
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
want to go into automotive technology
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's about two thousand dollars worth of
 
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
it's about two thousand dollars worth of
tools

00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
tools
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh because if you're working in uh the
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the technical trades the expectation
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that you're going to bring your own
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
tools and so we've
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
had to work on things as basic as how
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
can we help students to get the tools
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
that they need you know the
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
pell grants will cover their tuition
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
but not for instance if they're in a
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
profession that requires
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
uniforms and so on so it's been an
 
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
uniforms and so on so it's been an
all-in

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
all-in
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and then all consideration for us
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
to help our students uh one of the
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
things and you'll notice the second
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
bullet in
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
orange because this is a project between
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
our two systems
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
has been this thing called oer open
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
educational resources
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the last two years we have saved our
 
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
in the last two years we have saved our
students

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
close to a million dollars in textbooks
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think you've all heard the stories
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
about textbooks
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
well together we've worked on
 
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
well together we've worked on
identifying

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
high quality free resources and
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
a tip of the hat to robin derosa who
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
leads this effort she's at plymouth
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
state university and she's been
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
instrumental in helping us to grow there
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
the other piece though as i was
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
mentioning before is how do we keep the
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
students coming
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
because they have families to support
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
and in the pandemic
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
we've needed to create and maintain food
 
00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.149 align:start position:0%
we've needed to create and maintain food
pantries

00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
pantries
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
transportation assistance uh
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know closets with interview quality
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh clothing for students
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we've done all of this and we've
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
paid very careful attention to our fees
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
and in fact i
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that our presidents will
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
take one another on
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
when one particular college wants to
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
raise a fee to say
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
do you really need that money do you
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
really need
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
to ask our students to pay more and in
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
some cases the answer is i
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
i guess not let me work on this a little
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
bit better
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh and finally to pick up on what uh
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
scott was talking about we're trying to
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
build a culture of
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
philanthropy we did our first annual
 
00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:04.789 align:start position:0%
philanthropy we did our first annual
fund

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
appeal uh this year there hasn't been
 
00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
appeal uh this year there hasn't been
one

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's ever been one
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
i remember again doing one at
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
manchester a number of years ago but but
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're asking
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
our very proud graduates who are
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
staffing all of the businesses
 
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
in our state to contribute to
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
that next generation of workers that are
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
coming out
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to look at additional
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and so if we can go to the
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
appendix please
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
and the point we want to make here we
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
know that you can read our slides and so
 
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.190 align:start position:0%
know that you can read our slides and so
on

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
we want you to see that this is not a
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
brand new project
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
for us but over the last um 10 years we
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
have looked for ways
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce our expenditures
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
and the cost and so scott i don't know
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
if there are a few places here we just
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
want to point out
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
one or two statistics to uh the
 
00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:10.549 align:start position:0%
one or two statistics to uh the
committee

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
um sure we can we can start on
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
this uh slide where do you want to go
 
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
this uh slide where do you want to go
shannon

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
shannon
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's up to you scott you tell me the
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
benefits slide is is fine if you want to
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
stick with that and then maybe we'll go
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
the person i want after that so on the
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
slide here this has got the last uh
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
four fully closed year four full years
 
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
four fully closed year four full years
of

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
audited financial information in these
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
particular areas so
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of benefits you can see that
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
an exceedingly good job in to reduce
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
expenses as the chancellor said earlier
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
as the demands
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
change within our marketplace we are
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial enough to change with
 
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.310 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial enough to change with
them

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
and then so you'll see in our overall
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
benefit costs have
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
steadily declined and the 17.65
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
decline is the four-year accumulated
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
total from
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
fy 17 through fy 20.
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
we've done this again as we alluded to
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
earlier is negotiating
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
good contracts with our health insurance
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
carriers and our dental carriers and
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
you can see in the second group of uh
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
of the chart our overall health
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
insurance cost has gone down nearly you
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
know four and a half percent
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
over that time frame and as all you all
 
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
over that time frame and as all you all
know

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
health insurance can be a very fickle
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
thing because it depends on
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
the health of the people within your
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
organization who rolls off who comes on
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
and all of these things so
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've managed to keep it
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
relatively even and go down even a
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
little bit is a substantial win
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
for the community college system the
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
next section down is our dental
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
insurance program nearly 25
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
down by doing the same thing again
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
conservatively managing the
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
negotiating the benefits within our
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
package to
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
ensure optimal roi on what we're
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
looking to provide for our faculty and
 
00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
looking to provide for our faculty and
staff

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
the next section over is our
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
employee hra program that's gone down 25
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years and the one
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
thing i wanted to call out and i know
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
i've mentioned this at other hearings is
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we are trying to
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
do in your funding is so critical for us
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
is for some of the things that we cannot
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
we have no say in that are mandated by
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state which is this the retiree
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
health portion as you see here has gone
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
up actually over 69
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
over the last four fiscal years this is
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
a cost that we absorb
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
as we move forward but the offsetting
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
savings from these prior charts allows
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
us to do that but just
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
to show where we've again proactively
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
tried to reduce costs
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
and other costs we have to absorb
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
because they're mandated to us
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
scott i'm aware of um the time that
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're taking up
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to pull this back from you
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
shannon ask for a quick show of the
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
personnel slide that
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
and again you can see that
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have looked actively at ways to
 
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:06.870 align:start position:0%
we have looked actively at ways to
reduce

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
costs but yet maintain the quality
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
programming that we need
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
some of this is a reflection shannon if
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
you want to go on to the next slide as
 
00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:16.390 align:start position:0%
you want to go on to the next slide as
well

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we have changed our
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
staffing based upon
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
what programs we're offering and and
 
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
what programs we're offering and and
what

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
it is again aligns with what the state
 
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
it is again aligns with what the state
needs

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see the drop in our
 
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
so you can see the drop in our
expenditures

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
you can see the reductions in our
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
staffing and we'll go to the last
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
slide as shannon which is here on the
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
system office
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know as people think about this
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
notion of merger
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
one of the first things they think about
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
is well you know both systems have
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
central offices so let's just merge
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
those central offices
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
there must be a lot of people there who
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
are duplicating efforts
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we thought we would lay out for you
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
exactly who does what
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
in in our system office there are 40
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
full-time people
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
and two part-timers working in our
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
office you can see how those folks
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
lay out and since 2015
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
we have reduced the head count in our
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
system office by condensing positions
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
by using technology uh that supports
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
efforts rather than having
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
um you know people do the work in a non
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
in a manual way rather than an automated
 
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
in a manual way rather than an automated
way

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
to again be good stewards of the money
 
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.550 align:start position:0%
to again be good stewards of the money
that

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
we raise through student tuition and
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
sent our way as the state allocation so
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
i thank you for listening to us we're
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.870 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
have

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
i if it's okay um
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
i would like the university system to
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
provide their briefing and then
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter hold your write
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
your question down
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
and uh then we'll um we'll get back
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
to you so um
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who's going to talk first
 
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who's going to talk first
uh

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
joe it looks like your um microphone is
 
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.310 align:start position:0%
joe it looks like your um microphone is
on

on
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
i i think i will but um kathy will uh
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
jump in with slides in a second and i'll
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
walk through the first half of the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
slides and
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
let's do a walk through the second half
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
um you know other than representative
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
umberger and representative murray i've
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
never met any of you so
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
um madam chair if you don't mind i'll
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
just take a minute to
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
introduce myself uh that's okay
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so i've been
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
on the board for eight years the last
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
two years i've been chair of the
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
previous three i was
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
chair of finance when i joined the board
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
i was ceo of albany international
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
and served in that role for 12 years
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
recently retired and was responsible for
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
moving the company
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
from new york to new hampshire and
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
building that
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
large aerospace operation in rochester
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
before that job i was president of
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
bentley university for eight years
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
and before that i was a professor of
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
business strategy
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then a dean at the business school
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
at rpi i started my career at ge
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
and spent four years working for
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
president reagan's science advisor
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
and my beat back way back then at the
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of my career was
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
industry higher ed relationship so my
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
whole career has been bouncing back and
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
forth between
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
business and higher ed i i joined the
 
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
business and higher ed i i joined the
board

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
when when the governor asked if i'd be
 
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.550 align:start position:0%
when when the governor asked if i'd be
interested

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
i jumped at the opportunity because this
 
00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
i jumped at the opportunity because this
was

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
early in the early last decade and we
 
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
early in the early last decade and we
were

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
really struggling to find the talent
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
to build this we needed to hire about
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
500 people
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
to build this high-tech operation in
 
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.069 align:start position:0%
to build this high-tech operation in
rochester

00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
and i i think those of you who
 
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
and i i think those of you who
[Music]

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
have spent plenty of time in and around
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the state know the only
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
way we can manufacture in this state
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
is by focusing on high value added
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
differentiated products and processes we
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
can't compete on the basis of cost but
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can compete on the basis of
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
of uh differentiated products and
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing but that requires talent
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
and across the board talent from
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
associates degrees on the factory floor
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
to industrial engineers with bachelor's
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
and master's degrees who run the plants
 
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.190 align:start position:0%
and master's degrees who run the plants
to

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
research scientists and engineers and
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'd say i spent the better part of my
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
life those first few years
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we were going
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
to find the talent we developed a
 
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
to find the talent we developed a
wonderful

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
at the time path breaking program with
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
great bay
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
a training program for us and our
 
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
a training program for us and our
partner

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
partner
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
that was situated in rochester we also
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
made a significant gift to great bay but
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're also working
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
considerably with unh as well i have to
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that for all of those efforts
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
we we were forced to recruit an awful
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people from out of state it was
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
really frustrating and
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
really expensive and
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
but not because of a lack of effort on
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
the part of the community colleges of
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
the university system they were great
 
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
the university system they were great
partners

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
at nothing but admiration everything
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
susan has described in our colleagues
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
have described that
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
boy i just from an employer point of
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
view to just
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
admire it without reservation um
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
we actually backed away from our plan
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
to bring over our full headquarters we
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
had about
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 really good jobs in accounting
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
and finance we were a public company
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
global company
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we had to leave them back in albany
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
because we simply couldn't find
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
enough talent to staff those positions
 
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
enough talent to staff those positions
so

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
it was with at that level of frustration
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
it was about that peak frustration that
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
the governor asked if i'd
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
be interested in joining the board and i
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
jumped at it because i thought this
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be a shot at
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
helping to work the problem so that's
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's my background and if
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you hear a little passion or
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
frustration in what you're about to hear
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
as we
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
sort of look out toward the future of
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
higher ed it's got it is
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
not in any way based on criticism of the
 
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.589 align:start position:0%
not in any way based on criticism of the
experience

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
that i had with our higher ed partners
 
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
that i had with our higher ed partners
but

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
really a sense of deep concern
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
about where higher ed in general and in
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state public higher ed is heading
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and what the implications of that
 
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.109 align:start position:0%
and what the implications of that
potential

00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
wave after wave of challenge is going to
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
is going to mean
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the employers of the state and
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
therefore for the future economy of the
 
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
therefore for the future economy of the
state

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
particularly the employers who are
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about bringing in the kind of
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
jobs that we really want in this state
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
so with that as a backdrop sorry to if
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
i've gone long-winded uh kathy could you
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
put up the
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
so um you know the starting point for
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
us and and i'm speaking
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm really speaking on behalf of our
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
board here although everything i'm about
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
to say i feel
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
passionate about personally the the we
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
we have spent the last few years as a
 
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.230 align:start position:0%
we have spent the last few years as a
board

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
trying to come to grips with the
 
00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.430 align:start position:0%
trying to come to grips with the
implications

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
implications
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
of a dramatic downturn in
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
the demographics that is in the pool of
 
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.390 align:start position:0%
the demographics that is in the pool of
students

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
um that that we'll be serving in higher
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
education and
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
just just to put this in context higher
 
00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
just just to put this in context higher
education

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
has been growing steadily with a couple
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
of bumps along the way but it's
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's been a growth industry since world
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
war ii in the gi bill
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that we've seen a
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
demographic downturn and if you can look
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
at the left slide
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
um that purple line there
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh it starts in 2018 uh declines a
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
little bit through mid-decade and then
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
falls off a cliff
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
um that's the pool of that's the en
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
of uh potential students available to
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
four-year uh institutions like the usnh
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
four-year uh institutions like the usnh
institutions

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the northeast the purple line um this
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
is a regional slide
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
um now uh
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of things going on
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
here but one is simply
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're just fewer people being born
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so we can project with complete
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
accuracy or the
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
demographers can how many 18 year olds
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
the the second point here is you'll see
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the the dominant um
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh forecasters for higher education this
 
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.870 align:start position:0%
uh forecasters for higher education this
is

00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
nathan grah project
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
the same essentially the same curve in
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
the northeast for two-year
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
or two-year colleges
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
it hits first of course with that that
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
pool of
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh roughly 20 percent of the two-year
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
college students who are
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh 16 to 20 year olds but of course
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
those demographics
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
are going to wash through the whole
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
population in the two-year school so
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is like gravity this is coming
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no avoiding this the
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a decline in market
 
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a decline in market
unlike

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
anything that has hit higher ed it's
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to feel more like the textile
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
industry or the paper industry
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
by the time we get to a little after
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
mid-decade there's no avoiding this now
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
it it is exacerbated by
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
a problem that people in higher ed don't
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
like to talk to very much
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
talk about very much um the elite
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
schools are not going to have any
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
even though the pool of students is
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
shrinking they're going to be fine
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
because all they're going to do
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
to fill their class is they're going to
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
go cherry-pick
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
the best students out of the tier of
 
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.829 align:start position:0%
the best students out of the tier of
schools

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
who they used to reject kids from so
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll cherry-pick the top
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
students from tufts and from
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
harvard and mit will cherry-pick the top
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
students from tufts and
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
bc who will then turn around and charit
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
to fill their class
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
cherry pick the top students from bu and
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
umass amherst and umass lowell
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
who will then to fill their class turn
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
around and cherry pick
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
from the best students of unh and umaine
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
who will in turn animalize
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
their brethren at plymouth and keene who
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
in turn
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
will turn to that pool of transfer
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
students in the two-year schools
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
and cherry-pick from them as well and so
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
the farther down the food chain you are
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
in higher ed nobody talks about this the
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
more vulnerable you are to these
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
trends and and we're already seeing it
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know we look at the top
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
10 competitors quote unquote
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh to unh that is who when we look at
 
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.829 align:start position:0%
uh to unh that is who when we look at
who

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
we've applaud who's applied to unh and
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
who's been admitted
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
among the top 10 competitors are
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
plymouth and keen
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
when we look at keen among the top 10
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
competitors are unh
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
plymouth and nhti when we look at
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
plymouth state
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
among the top 10 competitors are unh and
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
keene state but also
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
nhti in great bay so as the pool shrinks
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
there's a massive game
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
of musical chairs going on and the more
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the rankings if you will the more
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
committed you are
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
or dedicated you are to serving poorer
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
populations the more vulnerable you are
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
to these demographic
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes and we're getting hit hard with it
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and and all the data says
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
two-year schools two-year colleges and
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
systems around the northeast are as well
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
kathy if you go to the next slide now
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's half the problem
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
and and remember we're only at the front
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
end of this
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is going to get much worse there's
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
no question that it's going to get much
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
worse it's like gravity the second
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
phenomenon which is hidden from view
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
on those first demographic slides is the
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
growing financial need
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the students we serve in both our
 
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.670 align:start position:0%
of the students we serve in both our
systems

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'll just talk about usnh and and again
 
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
i'll just talk about usnh and and again
there's

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
two dynamics going on the first is that
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
shrinking population
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
is just poor and you can see it
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the in in the composition of
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
of those demographics so in in the year
 
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.870 align:start position:0%
of those demographics so in in the year
2000

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
2000
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
um 29 of college age
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
or higher education age students were
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
people of color uh by 2018 the beginning
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
of that slide it's 45
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and people of color in general that
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
beta shows overwhelmingly are poorer
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
than than their white counterparts in in
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
20 in the year 2000 20
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
of that population was immigrants
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
or the children of immigrants today it's
 
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:17.990 align:start position:0%
or the children of immigrants today it's
in

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
by 2018 it's 28 and that number will
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
continue to grow too
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
so shrinking number of students
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
growing amount of financial need and
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
then you have to layer on top of that
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
another reality that people in higher ed
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't like to talk about
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's an all-out price war
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
going on right now
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh because the pool of students is
 
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh because the pool of students is
shrinking

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
shrinking
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
and the price war is taking the form not
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
of drops in tuition but of increases in
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
financial aid
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so the way the way schools that are
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
struggling to fill their
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
class with a smaller pool respond
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
is by trying to quote-unquote steal
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
other schools students by offering
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
better packages
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
and you get an arms race here of
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
escalating increase in financial aid
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
so if you look at usnh
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
and you look at the amount of financial
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
aid that we've been providing
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
just over the last few years you can see
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
the steady increase
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
big numbers so there's
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
there's a serious
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
revenue crisis that higher education
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
of all stripes is heading into and it's
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
taking the form
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
of a sharp decline in net revenue
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
that is the result of a combination of a
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
shrinking pool of students
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the growing growing financial need
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
of those students
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
it will we are at the beginning of this
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you go
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
if you think back to that demographic
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
slide just go back for one second kathy
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh just look at that waterfall starting
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
in mid-decade
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay so uh if you go so now what's the
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
consequence of this the consequence of
 
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
consequence of this the consequence of
this

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
is revenue begins to fall
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
and as revenue begins to fall
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
you try to take cost out as rapidly as
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
you can but
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
margins begin to erode so for usnh
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
from from fiscal year 17 so essentially
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of that demographic chart
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
you can see that our revenue has dropped
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
because of these two factors
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
has dropped by about eight percent or 27
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
our state funding the line in red so
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's the blue that's
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
tuition based net revenue so we're
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
leaving aside contracts and grants
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
tuition-based net revenue declined from
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
329.5 million
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
to 302 million over this period
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
state support was was flat happily
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you it started to increase a bit
 
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:01.990 align:start position:0%
thank you it started to increase a bit
uh

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the past biennium but but you can see
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
that given the magnitude
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the decline 27 million eight percent
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
the much appreciated increase in finance
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
in uh state support doesn't come close
 
00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.109 align:start position:0%
in uh state support doesn't come close
to

00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
covering the effect um and we understand
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
there are limits to what you can do i'm
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
not not here pitching for more funds i'm
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
just trying to show you the magnitude of
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
the squeeze
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and so the result is if you look at
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
those gray bars on the left side those
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
are our operating margin
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
and you can see that the operating
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
margin has basically shrunk from one and
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
a half percent which
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
isn't particularly good uh in in fiscal
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
year 17 to this year
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
excluding the one-time effects of covet
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually operating a lot worse if
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
you include cloven
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
but excluding the one-time effects of
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
covert we're we're going to lose about
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
now you know if you if you look over
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh the comparable data over on the
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
on the ccsnh side you can see net
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
tuition and revenue
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
is getting hammered by the same forces
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
that are hitting us
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
so net tuition is declined from
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
from 47.9 million to 39 million exactly
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
what all of the data in higher ed is
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to hit is hitting uh
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
two-year institutions in the northeast
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
very hard happily
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately and i'll say this jen i
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
i would say our board is cheering this
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
trend this
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
the state has stepped up and has been
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
offset those declines and um
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
we it and and
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for that from an employee
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
former employer's point of view that's
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful action
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
now the bottom line um
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
a declining
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
net revenue picture uh
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be too big in all
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
likelihood for the state to offset over
 
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
likelihood for the state to offset over
time

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
um declining margins
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
and we're at the front end of this now
 
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:14.630 align:start position:0%
and we're at the front end of this now
before

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh kathy starts telling you how we're
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
to at least catch up to these trends uh
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
just a couple more points
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide we we as a
 
00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:26.230 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide we we as a
state

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
public higher education in this state is
 
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
public higher education in this state is
you

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
is in a uniquely
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
weak position to take this crisis on so
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
we're entering into
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
a step change in the nature
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
of higher education starting from a weak
 
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.510 align:start position:0%
of higher education starting from a weak
position

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
so as you i'm sure you will know we
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
export in four-year schools four-year
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment we export nearly 60 percent
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
of high school graduates
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
going on to four-year enrollment and you
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
know again if you think about this from
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
an employer point of view once they go
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get them back
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's like recruiting somebody from
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
outside the state
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and if you combine both two-year and
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
four-year we lose more than fifty
 
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
four-year we lose more than fifty
percent

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
or we lose we lose close to fifty
 
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.150 align:start position:0%
or we lose we lose close to fifty
percent

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that's number one number two if you
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
go to the next slide
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we we have
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
very high tuition very high net
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
after financial aid net cost of
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
attendance so if you
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
this is for four-year schools you want
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
to look at the blue
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
line here so the blue line represents
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition the orange on top of
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
that represents
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
out-of-state tuition so the total bar is
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
total tuition
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
but you can see that if you just focus
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
on the blue
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is all the way over on the
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
right just
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
just before vermont we have the second
 
00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
just before vermont we have the second
highest

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
highest
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
net tuition in the country for a public
 
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.710 align:start position:0%
net tuition in the country for a public
university

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
and you know that compares to an average
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the country of about 10 million in
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
now same thing same thing with our
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
brethren in the two-year for
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
i mean they've done as susan described a
 
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.150 align:start position:0%
i mean they've done as susan described a
fantastic

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
job holding the line um but
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
likewise we're we're we're approaching
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
the crisis
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
as the second most expensive uh system
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
in in the country to attend now what
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
this says
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
is neither the four years nor the two
 
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.470 align:start position:0%
is neither the four years nor the two
years

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
can afford to raise tuition
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
to address this revenue crisis you just
 
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
to address this revenue crisis you just
can't

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
raise tuition if you tried
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
the market won't let you get away with
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
it you're going to wind up paying you're
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to wind up off setting it with
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
increased financial aid anyway but
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
but part of our crisis or part of our
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
challenge as
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
as a state is not only do we have to
 
00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:04.549 align:start position:0%
as a state is not only do we have to
find

00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
ways of reducing costs to offset
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that 25-ish percent collapse
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
in revenue net revenue we should be
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to reduce costs to
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
lower tuition
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've got to get to a lower tuition
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've got to get to
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
more affordable public higher education
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
and so that's why our you know our
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
proposal when we submitted it
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
um our budget proposal said well we'll
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
hold tuition flat again as we have for
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
quite a few years now but if you give us
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
we will use that to lower tuition and so
 
00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
we will use that to lower tuition and so
another

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
one of the hidden challenges here is
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
um it would be a lot easier to deal with
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
this revenue crisis if we were on the
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
one last point here which speaks to
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
the challenge this state is going to
 
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
the challenge this state is going to
face

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
in public higher education in the years
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
to come
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
we also approach this if you go to the
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
next slide kathy
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know not only are we the highest
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
exporter of high school students not
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
only do we have among the highest
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
tuition highest net cost of attendance
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're also structured in one of the
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
least efficient
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
manners in the country so if you just
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
look at the population
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
against the number of institutions
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
in higher education we're about 40th
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the country that is uh the more
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
population you serve per institution the
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
more efficient you are
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
the less population you serve per
 
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.430 align:start position:0%
the less population you serve per
institution

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
institution
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
the less efficient you are because every
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
institution you have means
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
fixed costs that are that are
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
unavoidable so
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at the right hand column the
 
00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:00.630 align:start position:0%
if you look at the right hand column the
population

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
of you look at state by state and look
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
at the population of people who are
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
under 25
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
and look at the number of institutions
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
that each state has
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
to serve that population we're we're the
 
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
to serve that population we're we're the
41st

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
41st
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
least efficient that is we have 41st
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
rank 41st in terms of number of
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
institutions per population served and
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
states below us tend to be
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
geographically dispersed
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
large geographies with dispersed
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
populations so
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide kathy so
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
essentially where our board is coming
 
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.750 align:start position:0%
essentially where our board is coming
from

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
is we are deeply concerned
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
um about a fundamental
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
structural permanent accelerating
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
change hitting public higher education
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's why the board
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
our board voted unanimously
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
to to basically instruct me
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with the leadership of
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
ccsnh a year ago
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
to see if we could start having joint
 
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:11.349 align:start position:0%
to see if we could start having joint
conversations

00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's what eventually led to um
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
that a working group to look for
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
synergies that
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
susan and her colleagues mentioned and
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's why we
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh formally voted in the autumn to
 
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.309 align:start position:0%
uh formally voted in the autumn to
invite

00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
invite
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh the community college board to uh
 
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh the community college board to uh
consider

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
a joint group to explore possible
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
relationships and it's why we responded
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
so positively
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
when the governor um made his proposal
 
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
when the governor um made his proposal
because

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
in our minds this is going to be this is
 
00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:43.109 align:start position:0%
in our minds this is going to be this is
this

00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
this is unprecedented in higher ed it's
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
very strong governance very strong
 
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.630 align:start position:0%
very strong governance very strong
leadership

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
constant strategic planning
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and amongst um
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
the legislators and and um and governor
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that's our starting point now we also
 
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.910 align:start position:0%
so that's our starting point now we also
understand

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
and and long before the governor made
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
his proposal we knew was our duty as a
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
board to get our
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
system uh as well as well positioned
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
for this tsunami as we could and so
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
kathy will just walk you through the
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
plan that we've put in place
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce our total expenses by
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
essentially 10
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
um which we believe with a little luck
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
will allow us to catch up to the trends
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
by 2023 and buy us some time to prepare
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
for the waterfall
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
in 2526. so kathy over to you
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks joe good morning good
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
morning everyone for the record my name
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
is catherine provencher and i
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
serve as chief administrative officer of
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
the university system good to be with
 
01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
the university system good to be with
you

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
folks all again um so so with that
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
um terrific
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
summary of what we are headed into
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
and have been living for some time
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
our board's been focused on this for
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
probably four plus
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
years and we've been doing multi-year
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
financial planning
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
um during that whole during that whole
 
01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
um during that whole during that whole
period

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
but covet really brought an urgency that
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
we we obviously could not avoid and we
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
undertook a very
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
significant effort last spring to do
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
financial modeling
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
and project revenues out to
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
2023 to make sure that post pandemic
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
we were on a trajectory for fiscal
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
sustainability and in that financial
 
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.870 align:start position:0%
sustainability and in that financial
modeling

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
modeling
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
we made assumptions relative to future
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment based on
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
demographics as joe mentioned we made
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
assumptions about
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
the financial aid needs of our students
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
residency mix state support
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
fundraising all of those things we we
 
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
fundraising all of those things we we
modeled

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
modeled
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
out and the result of that was we needed
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
to take out 10
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
of our costs by 2023 to be back in the
 
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.670 align:start position:0%
of our costs by 2023 to be back in the
in

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the black if you will and
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and um all of the campuses had
 
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
and um all of the campuses had
undertaken

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
work to identify various opportunities
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
that that we could grab onto in order to
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
put a roadmap together on how we are
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
going to achieve that
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
that reduction in our in our cost
 
01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:34.950 align:start position:0%
that reduction in our in our cost
structure

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
just one just one uh additional piece of
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
context we
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
we knew this covert year was going to be
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
a disaster
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
and we we made a collective decision
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we we would spend whatever it would
 
01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:46.870 align:start position:0%
that we we would spend whatever it would
take

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
to keep our students and faculty and
 
01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:49.910 align:start position:0%
to keep our students and faculty and
staff

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
safe even if it meant running huge
 
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
safe even if it meant running huge
losses

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
losses
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
as long as we could come
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
we could do what we needed to do to come
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
the covert year in a financially stable
 
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
the covert year in a financially stable
place

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
right so what that what that modeling
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
showed us is that our
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
our revenue excluding grants and
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and when i say grants
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
our grants from uh noaa
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
and nsf you know unh has significant
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
grant dollars so we excluded that
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
because that's a dollar and a dollar out
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
but our revenue is projected to drop
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
nine percent
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me from fiscal 20 to fiscal 23
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
which is how we arrived at the 70
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we need to take out
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
of our cost structure
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
to have a very slim
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
1 margin by fiscal 23
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
and so how are we going to do that
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
we put a plan together in categories if
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the first category when we adopted
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
the budget for this
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year fiscal 21 it was
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
roll all your spending back to fiscal 19
 
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.069 align:start position:0%
roll all your spending back to fiscal 19
actual

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
and that would take 10 and and remember
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
when we're doing this we're at the
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
toward the end of fiscal 20 getting
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
ready to adopt our
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 budget and that roll back
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
must be sustained into future years
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that took about 10 million dollars
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
out of the cost structure
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
we then put a category together
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
of shared opportunities across the
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
university system so those would be
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
a significant one was employee benefits
 
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
a significant one was employee benefits
restructuring

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is an area where when
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
revenue is shrinking
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
and that is a fixed cost it puts
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
real pressure on on the income statement
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
on the on the bottom line
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
so we've been focused on employee
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
benefits restructuring
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
we have done some of that work already
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
we're negotiating other parts of it
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
another again these are when you have
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
fixed cost
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
like the unfunded pension liability that
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
that scott mentioned earlier
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
that it just puts pressure on
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
the community college system when you
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
can't break through that
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
that unfunded pension liability the next
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
three items procurement
 
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:19.580 align:start position:0%
i.t and financial services again we have
 
01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.029 align:start position:0%
i.t and financial services again we have
[Music]

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
cost reduction estimates there we're
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually exceeding on it
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
and financial services right now but
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
those three i sit on that
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
ccsnh and usnh synergies working group
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we've already achieved as mentioned
 
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.789 align:start position:0%
and we've already achieved as mentioned
during

01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
the community college's presentation
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
some benefits in procurement and i.t
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
so i recognize that there are all
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
other opportunities there in the area of
 
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:47.910 align:start position:0%
other opportunities there in the area of
procurement

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
i.t and i i'm sure financial services as
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:53.190 align:start position:0%
i.t and i i'm sure financial services as
well

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
and um category three are campus
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
specific reductions that work is ongoing
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
at each of the campuses academic
 
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.549 align:start position:0%
at each of the campuses academic
restructuring

01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
program evaluation to make sure we're
 
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.309 align:start position:0%
program evaluation to make sure we're
aligning

01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
aligning
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment with capacity
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
um and and that works being done
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
but then as revenue can as joe mentioned
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
we're at the beginning
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that we see coming
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
the next wave will be and we have some
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
pilot projects going on but
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
course sharing across our campuses
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
and there's opportunity potentially with
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
ccsnh as well
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
the um i scott also mentioned
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
that the um federal stimulus money
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
provided opportunity for the community
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
colleges to invest in
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
academic technology the same is true at
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
where where course sharing is um
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
is starting to be evaluated and uh we're
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
working on that for the again for
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
the next wave that we know is going to
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
have significant revenue pressure
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
on us so how are we executing on this
 
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
on us so how are we executing on this
plan

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh a primary tool was an early
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
retirement program that was offered
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
last fall 50 of those people that were
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
eligible took advantage of that plan and
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
there are 480 employees
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
leaving the university system during
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
so so that was a significant tool to get
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
us to the 70 million dollars in cost
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
reductions that we need by
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23. i talked about the benefit
 
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.029 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23. i talked about the benefit
changes

01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
i t consolidation is complete we've
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
exceeded those savings targets
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of the financial and
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
administrative restructure and i
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the campus specific
 
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the campus specific
initiatives

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
those are my only comments i i really
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
leave time for for questions
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i will stop sharing so
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
the last point i i it to just give you a
 
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
the last point i i it to just give you a
sense

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
of the how our board views this
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
these are necessary at times painful
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:16.950 align:start position:0%
these are necessary at times painful
restructuring

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
10 of our people um
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
it just catches us up to those trends
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't get us ahead of them
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
it uh we hope it'll buy us a few years
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
to then figure out the next wave of
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
of steps um and
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh this this is going to be a permanent
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
part of how we
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
do business over the next 10 years
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you all for your
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's good to see that you're not sitting
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
there just uh
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
wringing your hands on either of the
 
01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
wringing your hands on either of the
place

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
either either side that um
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
you're actually making some progress
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
which i think is
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
um is extremely important
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
especially when we look at the
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
demographics of our state and the
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that so many of our
 
01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that so many of our
students

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
choose to go out of state to
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
um to college um you know whether it's
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
the two-year the four-year
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
but and i'm not exactly sure how we can
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate that but you know that's a
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's a choice
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
that the children and the parents make
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i think uh as has been
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the one of the reasons
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
is because our tuition and fees are
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
quite high and as a result
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
they can go to another university
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
out of state and get better um aid
 
01:10:02.159 --> 01:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
out of state and get better um aid
packages

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
packages
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
and so all of that you know plays a role
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
in uh in what we can do so
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative porter you had a question
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
a while ago i'm sorry but
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
i just thought it was good that we you
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
know got both briefings
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh asked the questions and
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
we've got we have plenty of time so
 
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
we've got we have plenty of time so
don't

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't hold that chair and actually it's
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
good because
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
i got more information from my questions
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's uh kind of grown into two so can i
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
ask the two questions
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely go ahead you can even ask you
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
can ask three
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay thanks so the first question
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
that i had had to do with
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
um the numbers of adjunct faculty that
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
are being used at the community colleges
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
listening to um you and the university
 
01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
listening to um you and the university
system

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
i guess it transfers over to that so
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
that was my first question
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
is there going to be an increase in the
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
use of that those faculty members
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the second question is if
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're reducing staff this much and and
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
reducing everything this much
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
is it also reducing the um programs and
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
offerings that we have to give to
 
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
offerings that we have to give to
students

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you know what i heard in the unh i
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
mean in the community college
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
was that you're expanding some of those
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
offerings but yet
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be reducing the number
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
of people working
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
is is how is that going to work and
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
those are my
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely thank you
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter for the
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
part of the answer is efficiency where
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases before we would have run
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
a tiny class we've
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have collapsed sections so that the
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment is larger
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're still staying in a a place where
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
our average cost enrollment
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
is just into double digits 10 11
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
12 but we've had to make
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
more thoughtful decisions about
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
how it is we employ part-time faculty
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
and in some cases when we are talking
 
01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:22.790 align:start position:0%
and in some cases when we are talking
about

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
new programming rather than hiring a
 
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.149 align:start position:0%
new programming rather than hiring a
full-time

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
faculty member to begin with we will
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
begin with part-time faculty because we
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if the program's going to be
 
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
don't know if the program's going to be
viable

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
viable
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't know uh what all of the
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
components need to be so we use adjunct
 
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
components need to be so we use adjunct
faculty

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
in a variety of ways you know if you if
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
some of the classic transfer courses
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
like uh english composition for example
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
there are a number of full-time faculty
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
members but there's usually a pretty
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
good size contingent
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
of part-time faculty in those places
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we do with adjunct
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
faculty is bring in practitioners
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
because that really is what finishes off
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
the education that we can offer
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
our students so you know um i think
 
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
our students so you know um i think
about

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the hvac program well joel pickering
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
who uh is the principal at denron
 
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.270 align:start position:0%
who uh is the principal at denron
plumbing

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
teaches within the hvac program the
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
line worker program employs either
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
recently retired or close to retirement
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
line worker utility workers so that our
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
students are actually learning from
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
people in the field
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
so there's been a variety of things that
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
so i think uh our answer
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
is pretty similar to to susan's
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the as
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
i think as as you were suggesting
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter the the real
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
challenge here is how do you preserve
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
your ability to deliver the mission of
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
affordable access to good quality
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
education while you're cutting and
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the short answer uh in addition to
 
01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
the the short answer uh in addition to
what

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
susan was describing is if you know
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
higher ed has been
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
in growth mode for 75 years
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the consequences is the
 
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
and one of the consequences is the
incremental

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
addition of small program on top of
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
small program for small numbers of
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
students and then you hire some faculty
 
01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
students and then you hire some faculty
to

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
support those programs so if you can
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
find a way
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
of rebalancing and uh
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
and cutting back on small enrolled
 
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.070 align:start position:0%
and cutting back on small enrolled
programs

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
and courses with small numbers of
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
students and redirect
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the reduced resources to the programs
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
where there are
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's greater demand for student and
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
more in larger classes than
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
then you can pull this off without
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
diminishing quality the
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
the problem with being able to make that
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a shift
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
is is in higher edge you've got tenured
 
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
is is in higher edge you've got tenured
faculty

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so if you if you were hired 30 years
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
ago to teach in one field which was
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
of demand then and no longer is you're
 
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
of demand then and no longer is you're
still

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
you're you're still pursuing your job um
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
even though they're not that many
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
students so the reason that we felt it
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
was so critical to
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
go to a voluntary retirement program
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
was to give faculty who
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
might otherwise not be able to afford to
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
retire the opportunity to do so and
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
hope that that would open up enough
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
positions that we could then do this
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions oh certainly go ahead
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so years and years ago my
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
late husband
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
had degreed to teach in colleges and
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
checked out
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
adject faculty positions and at that
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
time they were paid by credit
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
so they earned so much per credit that
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
they taught
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that still the structure or are they
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter it's both depends
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
it depends on the course it depends on
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
some adjuncts receive per credit but
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are other adjunct faculty that
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
that are on salary thank you and i think
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
the key
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the adjunct was the point that's that
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
susan made that if you have a
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
a core of faculty you can supplement
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
them with people with specialized
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
clinical real world expertise and
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
it really helps to fill out your
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
programs president did you
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah did you have a comment um
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
the thank you representative um
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
we don't i don't believe we have any
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
part-time faculty on
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
a salary i believe everyone is is paid
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
credit okay
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative turcotte i believe
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
your hand was next
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm not sure if
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is for uh
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
joe or catherine uh but on the slide
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
presentations on
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
page seven and eight um that talks about
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
the uh relative tuition uh by
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
each state could you give me the top
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
say two or three components or reasons
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
why that is you know when i first
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it my gut would say all right
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
the high tax states would be at one end
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
in the low tax states at the other but
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the case so whoever wants to
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
also before i go if joe and susan could
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
you send me your emails i know
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
catherine's is at the end
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
i have to leave this in about 12 minutes
 
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
i have to leave this in about 12 minutes
so

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
i i think i'll have some more questions
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative the the the primary
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
driver for that high
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
end state tuition is in fact
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
the relatively low state support
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
per student or per capita in new
 
01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.430 align:start position:0%
per student or per capita in new
hampshire

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
relative to other states around the
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
country i'd have to go back and look at
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
all of the states i mean some of the
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
states in the west it has to do with
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
um they may not have an income tax but
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
they have high
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
natural resources i'm thinking wyoming
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
and alaska et cetera
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
so um that's the that's the primary
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
driver i will also say that
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
new england in relation to many other
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
parts of the country is a higher has a
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
higher cost of living
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
so so that's relative as well to you
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
know across the 50 states
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
but the main the main driver is the
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
first one that
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
that kathy mentioned it's the data is
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
there if you look at
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
state support per per capita we're we're
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much the lowest in the country or
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
near the lowest in the country
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
but look uh nobody wants a state income
 
01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.510 align:start position:0%
but look uh nobody wants a state income
tax

01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
so it that's our reality to to
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know um what it means is it's not
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to change
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
so we've got to be more efficient in
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
other states that's the only that's the
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
only way you get around it unless
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
you want to live with higher tuition and
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can afford to live with
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
higher tuition much longer
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
put follow-up madam chair yes
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned uh state contributions
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
per capita do you would you have that
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
just for me personally i've never been
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
involved with this so i'd be great thank
 
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.310 align:start position:0%
involved with this so i'd be great thank
you

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay um representative lynn
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you this is really directed to to
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
both uh
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
the university system and the community
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
college system i'm wondering um
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
if you have if each of you have
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh some kind of data that you that in
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
written form that you could provide to
 
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
written form that you could provide to
us

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
that would show for example let's say
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
over the last five or six years
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
total number of students total
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
faculty members uh and i'm particularly
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about full-time but
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
it could include part-time too if that's
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
the way you do it but
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
so total students total faculty members
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
the thing that's most important to me
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
total non-faculty employees
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
because one of the things that that you
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
know i've heard has been a real issue
 
01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
know i've heard has been a real issue
not

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
not and i'm not trying to single out new
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire but just
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
generally around the country is that
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
while there's been this pressure
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
from uh sort of a reduction in students
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
there seems to have been uh uh
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
a discordant if you will uh increase in
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
in the uh ranks of administrators of one
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
kind or another and uh
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
i just would be interested in in seeing
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
if you have that
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
those kind of numbers and if we could
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
get them
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
certainly we we track that data
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you the community college i
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
believe also tracks that
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes some of it is available through
 
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
yes yes some of it is available through
ipads

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
ipads
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
um representative lynn it'll be a bit of
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
a challenge for us to capture
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
our non-credit short-term training uh
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
but we will give you that information as
 
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.790 align:start position:0%
but we will give you that information as
well

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
welcome i'll just
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
follow up a representative lynn that the
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
early retirement program
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
will also that won't that data won't
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know it hasn't happened yet but
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's also going to have a sig
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
both faculty and staff there were a lot
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
of people that took
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
took that advantage of the program so so
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the data
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
that i provide will not yet reflect that
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
10 reduction in our workforce maybe we
 
01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.229 align:start position:0%
10 reduction in our workforce maybe we
can

01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we can add that i think we did
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
some estimates of that right
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we yes and we do have it by faculty
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
staff yeah
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be great thank you very
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
much that would be very helpful
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative heath well thank you
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair first of all i just want to
 
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.310 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair first of all i just want to
say

01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
both your presentations were excellent
 
01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
both your presentations were excellent
um

01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
just um it always really upsets me when
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
i think about our university
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
systems and the community college system
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
struggling the way they are because they
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
are such a huge benefit to our state
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
so my my big question is why agree to
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
the merger
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
before a plan is established without a
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
road map
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
um just wouldn't it be better to take
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
the year to create the plan
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
before we legislate a merger and and
 
01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
before we legislate a merger and and
secondly

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know i look at the funding that that
 
01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
you know i look at the funding that that
we

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
actually for the university system and
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
we're giving you more money we're giving
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
you less money to do more
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
um we we didn't maintain the level of
 
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.470 align:start position:0%
um we we didn't maintain the level of
funding

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
from the last biennium and i just i'm
 
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.629 align:start position:0%
from the last biennium and i just i'm
concerned

01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
um because we are putting you in a
 
01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:09.910 align:start position:0%
um because we are putting you in a
position

01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do double duty work um
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
to come up with some kind of a road map
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
and plan
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
to significantly change the way
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
not only the university system works but
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the community college system as well
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
and it just
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
i feel like the city i was glad to hear
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
about the synergy group and all the work
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's already been done
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
but my concern is is this too fast
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
too soon or instead of a merger
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
legislated in hb2 should we take
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
a year to really give the synergy group
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
a chance to get going and have a road
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
map of where we're going
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
and i whoever wants to answer that

[Music]
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead susan i'm sure we have
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
different views on this so
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
we do we do have different we do have
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're interested in in what can happen
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
by being combined but we
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
share many of the concerns that you're
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
raising right now representative heath
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
um our when we look
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
when we review the literature that's
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
available on the mergers in the
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
20 other states it's
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
adversely affected the community
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
colleges it is
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
it is the mission of the community
 
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
it is the mission of the community
colleges

01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
that gets lost and everybody starts in a
 
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.669 align:start position:0%
that gets lost and everybody starts in a
place

01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
with excellent intentions
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
but where things go within a three-year
 
01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.550 align:start position:0%
but where things go within a three-year
period

01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the ability of community
 
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
in terms of the ability of community
colleges

01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
to meet the mission that they have
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem is and and uh
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
and joe and i have
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
have spoken about this and i don't
 
01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.470 align:start position:0%
have spoken about this and i don't
disagree

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the statistics i i probably do
 
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
with the statistics i i probably do
disagree

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
with how we see um the demographics
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
within the state and our opportunities
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
certainly i agree that our opportunities
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
for students have been
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
diminished but i i do see other
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities based in you know that was
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
why we put up the demographic
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
slide that we did so i think
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
based upon the conversations that we've
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
been hearing
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
i know that what our state is looking
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
for is a strong commitment
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
from ccsnh and usnh to look at this and
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
good and realistic decisions and so we
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely are committed to that
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i will also say you know in in
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the covid times the state spent a
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars on a study
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
for bea in terms of economic development
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
it also spent 1.4 million
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
on looking at reorganizations for dhhs
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
however you look at higher ed we are the
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
future of the state
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
spend some money on us figure this out
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
we will continue the synergies work
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
what you know we can uh
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know i look forward to you putting
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
accountability in place so that you are
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
reassured that we are doubling down on
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
but but we appear in this legislation to
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
but but we appear in this legislation to
be

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
starting at the end uh and and so let's
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
let's do some of the groundwork that
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
really needs to be done
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think my position will surprise
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
any of you i just
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
add to the the question for both of you
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
because i think it's so critically
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
important the college experience
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
for both systems is very different
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe in the future for the
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a workforce of a
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
age than the one being served by the
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure that that
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the systems
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
needs and the the needs of our
 
01:27:04.639 --> 01:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
needs and the the needs of our
individual

01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
students across the state be they young
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
or old
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
are met so um if you mr marone if you
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
would continue please
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so so first on the question of
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
where where i come out and where our
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
board comes out
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
this it's one thing to study in theory
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
have outside people come in to help you
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh with a group that doesn't have a
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
particular stake in implementing the
 
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.590 align:start position:0%
particular stake in implementing the
outcome

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's another thing to make the
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
commitment give
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the planning to
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to be
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
who are going to be charged with
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
implementing it
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
and then give them the resources and the
 
01:27:56.239 --> 01:27:57.270 align:start position:0%
and then give them the resources and the
cushion

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
cushion
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
to do the planning right so
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
in my experience across many sectors
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
it works much better to say yes we're
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
going to do this
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
create the new board give the new board
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
the charge
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
to lay out the map in a way that learns
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
all the lessons from other places
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
and crucially i think this is this
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
speaks precisely to your
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think very legitimate concern give
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
that board
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
the resources and the cushion
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
to do the planning right give them the
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
hire outside expertise and if you can
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
afford it don't cut their budgets right
 
01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.430 align:start position:0%
afford it don't cut their budgets right
away

01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
give them a little time to develop the
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
road map but the people who should be
 
01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.030 align:start position:0%
road map but the people who should be
the

01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
developing the road map are the people
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
who are going to own this it usually
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise i'll just give you an example
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
we have a zoom call next week with the
 
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:02.790 align:start position:0%
we have a zoom call next week with the
chancellor

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the pennsylvania state college system
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they're they're going through
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
a significant restructuring but
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's a restructuring that's been
 
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
it's a restructuring that's been
undertaken

01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
by the governing body and with all of
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
the participants who are going to be
 
01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.510 align:start position:0%
the participants who are going to be
involved

01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
involved not by a
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
previous group that's looking forward
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
and anticipating what's going to take
 
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.629 align:start position:0%
and anticipating what's going to take
place

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
you get real you get reality involved if
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
the people who have to implement the
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
plan are the ones who are responsible
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
for designing it so i i think the
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
governor's got it right
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
um on the question of the diversity
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
of of mission uh
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
i you know i i violently agree
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
and but but just give you two
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
slightly alternative perspectives um
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
to an employer there is one spectrum
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
of needs you you don't just need the
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
talents from the two-year system or the
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
talents from the four-year system
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
you need a broad array of talents and
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
you'd like to have a public higher ed
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
system that is
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
functioning in a way that is
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
getting us to the highest possible
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
quality at the lowest possible cost with
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
with uh with the employer's needs in
 
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
with uh with the employer's needs in
mind

01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the second is within each of our two
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
systems now there's within each
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's a wide diversity of mission so
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at granite state it's a
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
totally different mission from unh which
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
is totally different from
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
plymouth which is totally different from
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
keane and i
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's the same story within
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
the seven institutions of our our
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
brethren in ccsnh
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
and we've all learned i mean that's what
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
it means to be a system you've got to on
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
the one hand
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
respect the diversity of the various
 
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.709 align:start position:0%
respect the diversity of the various
missions

01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
missions
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
and identities but because you're a
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
mission you have a chance to actually
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um provide support
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the ones that are being that are
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
being challenged
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
um uh in a way that you couldn't if it
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
was a stand-alone institution
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know plymouth and keane if we just
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
talk about our own system
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
would have a very hard time surviving as
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
stand-alone institutions
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
but as part of a system they're going to
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative oh i'm sorry but yes
 
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.629 align:start position:0%
uh representative oh i'm sorry but yes
yes

01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want to turn this into
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh competition between us
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
but i have to
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i loved your expression violently
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
agree i have to disagree
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
the seven community colleges well not
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
violently this time but i'm sure
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be one
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
excitedly how's that new adverb
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the the seven community colleges
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
may differ by local flavor but we have
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
the identical
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
mission and and i absolutely respect
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
usnh colleges and universities have
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
different missions
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
they should our state needs them but but
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
what is needed from the community
 
01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
what is needed from the community
college

01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
is a universal mission across our our
 
01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.229 align:start position:0%
is a universal mission across our our
state

01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative petry you
 
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative petry you
have

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
a question yeah thank you uh madam chair
 
01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.270 align:start position:0%
a question yeah thank you uh madam chair
uh

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
the uh of the 20 uh merges that you've
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
seen around the country have you seen
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
any successes
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the mergers uh you know that you are
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
significant and how would you protect
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that question
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative there are elements of
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
success in
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
quite a number of the mergers and those
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
are things that we could
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
look at the the piece
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
that i'm most concerned about because it
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
disappears early as the voice of the
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know as you're hearing
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
we have different missions they may
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately all roll up
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the same place they are ultimately
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
about most folks in our state are
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
are going for an education so that they
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
end up with a satisfying and fulfilling
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh career and job so we do all get there
 
01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh career and job so we do all get there
but

01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
but we get there in different ways and
 
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
but we get there in different ways and
um

01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
it just when an entity is created that
 
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.950 align:start position:0%
it just when an entity is created that
puts

01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
puts
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
all of these differing missions these
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
differing institutions together
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's the voice of the community
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
college that
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh suffers um you know our
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
where we serve such a a diverse
 
01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
where we serve such a a diverse
population

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of age and ability and interest
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
that um it's
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
the people's ability to focus on exactly
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
what it is that we need for
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
particular groups of students just
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
makes it easy to kind of slough off
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
particular groups in our previous call i
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the university of alaska
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and what has happened to
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
the community colleges there and the
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment now granted
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
the enrollment in community colleges is
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
down nationally
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
for a whole bunch of reasons but
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
when that merger started in 1987
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
there was an intention to have a
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
difference in tuition
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that's where they they began where
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
the community college students were
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
paying a lower level
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
a lower rate for tuition than the
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
university students
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
but as time went on and the budget got
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
tighter the university was no longer
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
or the unit of the system was no longer
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
support a lower tuition for the
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
community college students
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
and what happened as a result of that
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
community people who would attend
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
community college for home affordability
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
is a critical issue disappeared
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
and then and then ultimately that has a
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
poor effect on the state because
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
we need people to be well educated in
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
whatever path they take whether it's a
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
technical trade
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
or it's a professional area so
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that i've
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
said repeatedly
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
is that as as i'm going forward with
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
what is it that is going to be done to
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
protect the voice of the community
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
college and i go back to
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
what i said a few minutes ago i believe
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you tell us from the beginning that
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that initially our voice will be heard
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
but as we go forward
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie i think the
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
the view that susan is expressing
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
is supported by reality
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's just undeniable
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
that that is a risk here so the question
 
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.709 align:start position:0%
that that is a risk here so the question
is

01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
and yet none of us would argue that that
 
01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
and yet none of us would argue that that
mission

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
is less important than any other higher
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
ed mission
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
and certainly you you're not going to
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
find an employer in the state
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
who would make that case they'll argue
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
as i've been trying to argue
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the state needs the full spectrum
 
01:36:27.119 --> 01:36:28.229 align:start position:0%
that the state needs the full spectrum
of

01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
of educational programs um in the most
 
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.870 align:start position:0%
of educational programs um in the most
affordable

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
manner possible and the most accessible
 
01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.070 align:start position:0%
manner possible and the most accessible
now

01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
um the what i found really interesting
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
about the governor's
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
one of the many things i found really
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
interesting about the governor's
 
01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.189 align:start position:0%
interesting about the governor's
proposal

01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
structure over represent
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the community colleges so it's five
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
board members selected by the usnh
 
01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
board members selected by the usnh
institutions

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
five five board members selected by the
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
ccsnh institutions and
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
five board members at large selected by
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you did this you know the way most
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
organizations would
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
would put together a board it would
 
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
would put together a board it would
reflect

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
relative revenue and so you get
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
um eight board members
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
from the usnh institutions and two from
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh the ccsnh institutions but this
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
by having five and five plus
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
five at large and one would hope the
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
five at large are people who
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
employers from the state and educators
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
from the state who have a deep
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
commitment to the public education
 
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
commitment to the public education
mission

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i think you could argue the people
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
that governors have been picking
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
for our various boards do have that
 
01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
for our various boards do have that
commitment

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
the the answer to the question how do
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
you how do you assure
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
the and protect over the long haul the
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
mission of the community college systems
 
01:38:02.639 --> 01:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
mission of the community college systems
is

01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
the board and
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
and it is up to the way that is written
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
it is up to
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
the member institutions to recommend
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
their slate of nominees so
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
as long as the member institutions
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
among the two-year schools are selecting
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
strong advocates strong and effective
 
01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.910 align:start position:0%
strong advocates strong and effective
advocates

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
they'll have a powerful voice on the
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
board that's number one number two
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
the first action the board has to take
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
is to hire a chancellor
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
and um that i assume that board
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
is going to put together a committee
 
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.750 align:start position:0%
is going to put together a committee
comprising

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
comprising
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
members of the universities of a
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
selection from the five
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
board members nominated by the
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
university system and an equal selection
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the five members
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
nominated by the community college
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
system so
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
that chancellor needs to be somebody
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
who is deeply committed to to the full
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
spectrum of missions
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
and again how do you ensure that that's
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
on that's that's in the hands of the
 
01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.189 align:start position:0%
on that's that's in the hands of the
board

01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you both uh
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
question

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i think two
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions because i think they're
 
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
questions because i think they're
related

01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i've certainly talked to a number of
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
you about this i've been spending a lot
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
of time thinking of it
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to go back a little bit to
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative heath's um
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
remarks um about a timeline for this
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to me in my experience with
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
academia which is
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
moderately substantial uh there's
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
um the academic side and then there's
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
the business side
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
it seems that in the talking about this
 
01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
it seems that in the talking about this
merger

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
merger
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a different approach from
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
the business side than there would be
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
from the academic side
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd like you to speak to that to
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
those issues how you see us moving
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
forward with the merger
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
on those two different tracks and then
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's a third element i was almost
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
going to refer to it as a third rail and
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a mistake because
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
i see the third element is the state
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and there may be there should be some
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
interaction with this with the state in
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
doing some of this
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking in regards to
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
what the state could do to help move
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
this along and in particular
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
um for instance the pension liability if
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
the state could help out with pension
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
liability that you have to take off some
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the pressure from both the community
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
college and the university system
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
but that needs to be um a dynamic
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
active kind of a thing as opposed to
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
every two year there's a budget and
 
01:40:42.159 --> 01:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
every two year there's a budget and
maybe

01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
on the off year you can submit a bill if
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you're so inclined
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
so can you address the differences that
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
you would have to approach from the
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
academic which is
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
in my mind at least a four-year cycle
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we've talked i've talked to all of
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
you about this a little bit before
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
um what's involved with the business
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
cycle of it
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
and how you would see the state
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
interacting to try to help financially
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with some of the issues that the
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
merger is going to bring up i hope that
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
either one can go ahead go first second
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
goes first this time okay okay
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i they're they're well you've got
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
multiple questions in there and they're
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
all great
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
so um uh
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm hesitating because i can't
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
speak for the future board who know we
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what the future board is
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to look like that's in the hands
 
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.070 align:start position:0%
going to look like that's in the hands
of

01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
the governor and the two and the two
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
sets of institutions but
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
i would say um that what we learn
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
over and over and over is if you're
 
01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.510 align:start position:0%
over and over and over is if you're
doing

01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
this kind of a merger in crisis where
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
you're having to cut
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
just to balance the budget you're going
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
to make mistakes
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you you're going to compromise the
 
01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.350 align:start position:0%
and you you're going to compromise the
quality

01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
of of your programs and and that's and
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
missions can get jeopardized so so we
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
all know this is going to be
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
a very difficult 10 to 15 years
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
if the more cushion that you can provide
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
the new board and the combined system
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and cushion takes multiple
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
forms one is just
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
no budget cuts a second
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
is support to enable the new board to
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
hire outside um
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
then then then you have the time to plan
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
correctly the easy things to do
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
like uh taking advantage of the overlaps
 
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
between the two system offices and
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
everything we were talking about the
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
synergies around i.t and
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
and um financial aid and benefits and
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
you can do those you can do those back
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
room operations that don't affect your
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
student but you
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're buying time to carefully
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
plan the kinds of academic
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
um programs and changes that you're
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
eventually going to make you know if if
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
time then then you can give
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'll just take an example a cluster of
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
two-year and four-year
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
institutions serving the manchester area
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
you can give them time to sort through
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
where there are obvious overlaps and
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
reduce those while better serving the
 
01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:48.629 align:start position:0%
reduce those while better serving the
students

01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
but if you're if you're in if you're
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
literally cutting budget in year two
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have the time to do
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
that intelligently and involve the
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
map it out so i think that's the
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
the big thing that the state could do
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the two systems to get this right
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll take the notion of cushion that
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
joe is speaking about
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
and talk about the fact that not only
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know our faculty our staff
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
are really thrown by this conversation
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're in a pandemic and we're also
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
merging uh two entities potentially
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
sloughing off
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
um you know colleges and so on and
 
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
um you know colleges and so on and
um

01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
if there's a way to have a cushion
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
so that people can focus on doing the
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
work that
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
joe has just described without worrying
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i i
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
i've had literally dozens of calls
 
01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
i've had literally dozens of calls
saying

01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
am i going to lose my medical insurance
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
on july 1.
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
we there are people in these systems if
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
i don't even speak about students right
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
now and i just speak about our employees
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
there are lots of very nervous people so
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
as um the state is asking us
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
to do the work of creating a more
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
efficient more effective
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
public higher ed entity what can you do
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
to support the people who are doing the
 
01:45:29.119 --> 01:45:30.149 align:start position:0%
to support the people who are doing the
work

01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:34.070 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis
[Music]

01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking people to have very hard
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
conversations they're worthy
 
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.590 align:start position:0%
conversations they're worthy
conversations

01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
but they're hard conversations
 
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
but they're hard conversations
[Music]

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
there are any number of things that
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
to your question and i think back to
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
your comments last time about the
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh the failed merger of nhia and snhu
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
there are there are lots of academic
 
01:45:58.639 --> 01:45:59.990 align:start position:0%
there are there are lots of academic
questions

01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
so um i appreciate the notion that we
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
would like to be supported through this
 
01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.430 align:start position:0%
would like to be supported through this
financially

01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i also want you to think about other
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
ways that we can support people
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
as they try to do the work um
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and maybe i'll i'll make a
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
distinction in talking with
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative heath we talked about
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
a study maybe study isn't the right word
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
for it maybe the word for it
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
is planning give us the opportunity
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
to plan this out so that where
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know we we can see where we're
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
moving um
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
frankly we haven't you know terribly
 
01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
frankly we haven't you know terribly
involved

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
all of the constituencies in this
 
01:46:43.679 --> 01:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
all of the constituencies in this
conversation

01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff in the community
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
college system are aware of this
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
our students are aware of it they don't
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
really know what it means they're just
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
are large groups of people that we're
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
going to need to
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
bring along with us we we did um
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
post on our portal we we gave folks an
 
01:47:02.639 --> 01:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
post on our portal we we gave folks an
opportunity

01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
to comment to us and then i i we asked
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
for um an
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
external uh communications agency uh
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
cookson communications
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
to take all the feedback that we got and
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
to organize it in a
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know in an objective way so that we
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
could see what
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh employees were thinking about but you
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
know there there are
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
there are huge academic concerns here
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
huge administrative concerns um there
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
are just some
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know interesting differences as
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
we've been doing the synergies work uh
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
this last meeting we were talking about
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunities
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
for merging insurance it turns out that
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
both um
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
systems are using uh one particular
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know a vendor i guess i would
 
01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
um i don't know a vendor i guess i would
call

01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
to identify uh different insurance plans
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
for us and
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
we started to have a conversation about
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
auto insurance you know
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
the community college system is smaller
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh than
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
than usnh and we thought well maybe we
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
could save some money
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
on auto insurance it turns out that we
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
have a better rate
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
because the only people who drive ccs
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and h vehicles
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
are employees whereas the university
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
rightfully has a need for students to
 
01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
rightfully has a need for students to
drive

01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
drive
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so i guess we've experienced what
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
every family does
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
when those teenagers move into their 20s
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
and your rates go down
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
there are conversations for us to have
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
that are that minute
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
there are much more important
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
conversations about
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know what the pathways are for
 
01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
you know what the pathways are for
students

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
going through for liberal arts degrees
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
or or technical degrees but
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative mario you're right
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot here and i and i
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
do hope
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we can create a way so that we can
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
look at a plan
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we look at what the
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
state of maine has done and we certainly
 
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.189 align:start position:0%
state of maine has done and we certainly
have

01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities from what vermont is doing
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
in in 2015
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
maine created what they called the maine
 
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
maine created what they called the maine
higher

01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
education coordinating council
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a very small group it is the
 
01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
and it's a very small group it is the
chancellor's

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
chancellor's
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
um it's the chancellor of the university
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
of maine system and the board chair
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is the uh the president of the
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
and his board chair and it is the the
 
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.109 align:start position:0%
and his board chair and it is the the
admiral

01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
admiral
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
of the maine maritime academy and and
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
and their legislature charged them
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
with figuring out some of the things
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
how to make school more affordable how
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
to improve transfer
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities how to take advantage of
 
01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.629 align:start position:0%
opportunities how to take advantage of
collaboration

01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce administrative costs and and
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
they write
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to their legislature
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and to me that's a plan you know will
 
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:51.669 align:start position:0%
um and to me that's a plan you know will
they

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the the very last thing on their list of
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is looking at where
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
they could merge
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh their systems to gain more financial
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
and academic opportunity you know that's
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
to be moving in that direction
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
to joe's exact point this takes years
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about possibly as
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
long as a decade to figure this out
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
now if if we take advantage of
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to look at other people
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
we may be able to
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish this in a shorter period of
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
time but we're dealing with two very
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
complex systems representative murray
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
just had two more points but
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
kathy you wanted to no i just wanted to
 
01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.589 align:start position:0%
kathy you wanted to no i just wanted to
mention

01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
kind of tight tie it all together so
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
um representative murray your your
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
questions are spot on
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
but but this new this new board should
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
be ta
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully provided the resources to
 
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.070 align:start position:0%
hopefully provided the resources to
actually

01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
build a roadmap of what those work
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
streams are
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
what the timeline would be and let's not
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
forget that
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
everything has to come back to the
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislature this isn't the
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature's last look
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
at at how this is going to play out
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
the bill requires that the new board
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation um
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider if there is if
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
resources available to support the board
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
roadmap come back to the legislature as
 
01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
roadmap come back to the legislature as
well

01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
tying those financial academic
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
the the state issues that you mentioned
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and again i'll just come back to
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
joe's earlier point
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
to task the group that's going to be
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
required to implement
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
is the group that has the most skin in
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
the game
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that was one of the points i wanted
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
to try to emphasize
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
the what i see across higher ed and
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
outside higher ed is the most
 
01:52:04.159 --> 01:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
outside higher ed is the most
interesting

01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
work going on in trying to address
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
the profound structural change that
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
higher ed is going to go through is
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
takes place inside a unified governance
 
01:52:20.639 --> 01:52:21.430 align:start position:0%
takes place inside a unified governance
structure

01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying i'm not saying that all
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
that structures where all parts of the
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
system are
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
under the same roof but if you look at
 
01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:31.830 align:start position:0%
under the same roof but if you look at
maine

01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the university system they
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
they under one governance structure they
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
came up
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
with a plan for single accreditation for
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
the whole system
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
which will pay off in
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
ways they they're not even anticipating
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
yet when you start thinking about
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
sharing courses and sharing programs
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
they couldn't have done that if they
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
were separated
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
governance structures now that doesn't
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
involve the community college system i'm
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to make the point
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the innovation taking
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
place in pennsylvania right now
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
in their state college system not their
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
university system it's 14 institutions
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
and they're doing some very interesting
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
and creative integration
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
but it's within the umbrella of a
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
unified governance structure the people
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the skin in the game
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's that was one point i wanted to
 
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
try to emphasize and commissions
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
that cut across governance structures
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
tend to do a lot of talking
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of a lot of white papers but
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
the hard work's got to be done inside
 
01:53:31.599 --> 01:53:33.030 align:start position:0%
the hard work's got to be done inside
governance

01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
governance
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
was the unfunded pension liability
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
and boy um you know that's a that's a
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
ticking time bomb
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
with no plan right now to defuse it um
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at this from uh
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
from the usnh perspective we've worked
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
really hard to build and preserve our
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and our endowment and
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
merging that endowment with that
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded pension liability immediately
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
hurts our bond rating um
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
and uh the stake could help a lot
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
in um helping that new board think
 
01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:13.750 align:start position:0%
in um helping that new board think
through

01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
how to um essentially
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
diffuse that time bomb and it could take
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
any number of forms
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be a plan for that
 
01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:24.950 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be a plan for that
quickly

01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
and possibly it's something that could
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
be incorporated
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
into the enabling legislation that the
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
new board has
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
matt you had a question or comment you
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
chairman berger just wanted to build on
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
on what joe and kathy just
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned and try to reorient this
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
conversation to what
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 is introduce actually seeks
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the level of granular
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
detail this conversation has gone on to
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
but what hb2 does as introduced is set a
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
directional path
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
to allow the new unified board to dive
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
into these issues and figure out what
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
that roadmap looks like
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
is it a two year five year or ten plan
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
to fully consolidate
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know some of these different systems
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
together whether it be
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know the staffing or the i.t or
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
we know that's not going to happen
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
overnight or in the next six months
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
but what hb2 asks the legislature to
 
01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.550 align:start position:0%
but what hb2 asks the legislature to
endorse

01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
is a directional pathway to put this new
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
unified structure
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
into place and empower them to make
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
those decisions
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
over whatever time horizon that new
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
board identifies
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
and again i don't want to try to solve
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
80 different issues
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the next two weeks because that's
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
certainly not the intention of hp2
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it's something definitely better
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you have
 
01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:06.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you have
a

01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um again um
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
just after listening to everybody i feel
 
01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:14.310 align:start position:0%
just after listening to everybody i feel
um

01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
more actually more concerned
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
without a definitive charge to this new
 
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
without a definitive charge to this new
board

01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have a synergies group that's already
 
01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:27.270 align:start position:0%
we have a synergies group that's already
working

01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
and they've already taken some steps and
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
some things have already
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
been defined but now we're saying we're
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to establish
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
a new chancellor a whole new board
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
um without
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
the the this kind of loose direction
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
without the the the tools and
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
and um direction that i really feel like
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
a brand new board with a brand new
 
01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.270 align:start position:0%
a brand new board with a brand new
chancellor

01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
needs to have i think if we could take
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
more time
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe synergy's group or the higher
 
01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.310 align:start position:0%
and maybe synergy's group or the higher
ed

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
ed
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
um group could come up with a
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
better idea of what needs to happen
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
and then to look at the funding
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
resources i mean when i
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think about the the work that needs to
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
be involved
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
in something like this not to provide
 
01:57:23.679 --> 01:57:23.990 align:start position:0%
in something like this not to provide
more

01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
resources is just um it's just like
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
asking you to do something
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
and giving you less resources to go
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
double the work that you have to do so
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's basically
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
my concern and question but i just feel
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
like we
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
need to do better diligence um
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
going into this and give the new board
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
the effective information they need
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
the tools with when with which to work
 
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.189 align:start position:0%
the tools with when with which to work
um

01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
because i agree i really think we need
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
we desperately need to do something but
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
jump into the water in the deep end and
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
not know how to swim
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative murray
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
in order in moving i mean this is a
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
tough budget year you all know that
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
we all we're all suffering through that
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
i also am certainly leaning towards
 
01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
i also am certainly leaning towards
providing

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate and adequate funding for the
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
systems as they are now and also
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
resources for going forward
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
in order to get there i think in some
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
people's mind
 
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
it may be helpful to know
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
basically what the return on investment
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
would be that you know sometimes you
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to put up a little money in front
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
in order to get those savings later on
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
or you need to put up that money in
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
front to avoid some kind of crisis later
 
01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
front to avoid some kind of crisis later
on

01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's fine to say in the abstract
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
um but could you speak to a narrative
 
01:58:59.599 --> 01:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
um but could you speak to a narrative
that

01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
um you know support i'm just you know
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're i have no idea what we're going to
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
be doing here with
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
division two but i'm just trying to
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
think forward a little bit
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
um if we seem to be leaning or wanting
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
to go down this path
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
how how would you sell it in terms of in
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
terms basically in terms of finance if
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's not putting too bald uh
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
i see susan and kathy went on mute so i
 
01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.189 align:start position:0%
i see susan and kathy went on mute so i
figure

01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
figure
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'll i'll take a stab and then kathy
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
and susan says
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
kathy you can bail me out after i
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
completely mess up the answer
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
um if if you look at um
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
how we're doing the restructuring at
 
01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
how we're doing the restructuring at
usnh

01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
usnh
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
um we hired an outside
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh firm that has expertise in higher ed
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
the huron group
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh which has done a lot of restructuring
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think their latest engagement was in
 
02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.350 align:start position:0%
i think their latest engagement was in
wisconsin

02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
wisconsin
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know the board really
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
insisted on getting that outside help
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
and and kathy
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
hired huron and took quite a bit of heat
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
for it because it was a
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
little more than a half million dollars
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
but they
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
they provided the um the road map
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
for us to get to that 10 savings without
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is the key point without um
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
undermining our ability to deliver our
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
education mission at our four
 
02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.070 align:start position:0%
education mission at our four
institutions

02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
and so that return is going to be
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
something like for
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand dollars a return of
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
70 million a year for a long time
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
um you can't so
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
so it would be it's
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's easy to cut and do damage it's
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's how do you do this intelligently
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
over a
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
multiple year period with road maps that
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
have been thought through
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
carefully and you and that avoid all of
 
02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:09.669 align:start position:0%
carefully and you and that avoid all of
the

02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
very real pitfalls that susan has
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier that other
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
that other states have stepped right
 
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:16.870 align:start position:0%
that other states have stepped right
into

02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's some good stuff going on in
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
other states and there's some stupid
 
02:01:19.679 --> 02:01:20.709 align:start position:0%
other states and there's some stupid
stuff

02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
and we want to know all of it and we're
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay people to help us
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
i say we and what i really mean is the
 
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.109 align:start position:0%
i say we and what i really mean is the
newborn

02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
newborn
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
we'll see who's on the board so i'll
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
just follow up
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
full disclosure community college system
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the university system have put in a
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal note
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
relative to this um this piece of house
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
and we estimate that over the biennium
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
we'll need a million to a million and a
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
half dollars
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
in external support and and frankly if
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
if it were my wish it would all come in
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
year one
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing um and
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
what i base that on is that it what we
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
base that on
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
admittedly it's a bit of a swag but i
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
had conversations with huron
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
susan and i talked to michael thomas the
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
director of the new england board of
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
higher ed this week to understand
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
what what has happened in and that what
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
costs have been incurred in vermont and
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
in connecticut
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
i will also say that these are costs
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're estimating to provide the road
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
help this board provide the road map the
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
planning the work streams
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily implementation
 
02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:38.390 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily implementation
and

02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
i guess um representative murray on the
 
02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.629 align:start position:0%
i guess um representative murray on the
roi

02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
my fear is within five years we will be
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
just crushed to a point that
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
we will both have a very hard time
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
sustaining the work the good work that
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
we all do now
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
knowing all those challenges that joe
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
went over
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of of the presentation
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
do i have a number for you no
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
but but um the state will not be able to
 
02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
but but um the state will not be able to
support

02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
the drastic reduction in revenue
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the university system and the
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
will sustain over the next decade with
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
the headwinds that we're moving into
 
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.149 align:start position:0%
the headwinds that we're moving into
follow-up

02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
um just again i mean these are just very
 
02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:35.830 align:start position:0%
um just again i mean these are just very
speculative

02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
speculative
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
is it hyperbolic to say that the
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
university system and the community
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
college system would disappear
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
um or become so i mean
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
i don't even mean you know disappear
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
entirely but um
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
basically become non-viable institutions
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't think they would look like they
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
look like now
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's several several institutions
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
you can't take 30 percent of revenue out
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
25 percent of revenue out and expect
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
everybody to survive unless you've
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
susan all right
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of one of the other hats that i wear
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
is i'm a commissioner
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
for uh the new england higher ed
 
02:04:30.079 --> 02:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
for uh the new england higher ed
commission

02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
and every uh meeting we begin with what
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
i refer to as the wake and funeral
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
and this is where private institutions
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and have reached the end of their uh
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
their life and they they come forward
 
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.669 align:start position:0%
their life and they they come forward
with

02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
um what now feel like very hopeless
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
plans they're going to by some miracle
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
increase their student enrollment uh 20
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and they've identified two huge
 
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.229 align:start position:0%
um and they've identified two huge
donors

02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
donors
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then at the next meeting we hear
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
that well that didn't quite
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
work out for them so i i certainly
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
hear that we need to change
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i think we we all agree on that but
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
we don't agree on
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
the path i mean when i read hb2 and i am
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
so far out of my league and
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
understanding and thank you for the work
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
that you do because it's
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
so highly detailed just a little
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
experience i've had in the last six
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
months with this
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh has been uh overwhelming at times but
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
how do we institute or constitute a
 
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
how do we institute or constitute a
board

02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know july 1 the the the statute
 
02:05:50.550 --> 02:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
takes effect by august 30th we have a
 
02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
takes effect by august 30th we have a
board

02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
by november that board is supposed to
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
talk about the revision of the statutes
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then in january they're going to
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
begin to look for
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
a chancellor which is you know at least
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
a year-long process
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
no place in here am i hearing what the
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
vision is
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
other than we're going to save money so
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
i want us to think about how this
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
happens what's
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable way for this to
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
happen that preserves
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
the urgency that people are seeing and
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
that i agree with
 
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
but that still allows us to continue
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
doing business um
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a real challenge right now for
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
our colleges to be thinking in terms of
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
strategic planning when they don't
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
really even know
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
if they're going to exist for the next
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
so what is it that you as our
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body can do
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
so that we keep moving forward but we we
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
idea as well rather than
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
what right now feels like a total
 
02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.750 align:start position:0%
what right now feels like a total
upending

02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
upending
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay um this has been a
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
extremely informative
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
session and
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
we will um
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
obviously as division two
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
we'll um be talking about this
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
one day next week it'll probably be
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
wednesday or thursday i'm not you know
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're just out there as hb1 hp2
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
and um i think that
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
that all of us have a lot of stuff to
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh to think about and
 
02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.669 align:start position:0%
uh to think about and
um

02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think that hopefully as we are
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
as we are thinking about this
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
we take we take our blinders off if
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's the right term
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can you know think out of the
 
02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.109 align:start position:0%
so that we can you know think out of the
box

02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
box
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
and it may be you know i'm just
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
there may be a different way to
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
without ending up
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
with nothing happening
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
and that too many times
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh we've seen this happen you know the
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
difference in private industry
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
is you know a company buys somebody out
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
and they merge okay
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
well neither the community college
 
02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
well neither the community college
system

02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
nor the universe university system is
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
buying somebody
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
out you know your work or an education
 
02:09:08.079 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
out you know your work or an education
system

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
mergers go on all the time
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh two companies that have totally
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
different cultures
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
totally different missions in some in
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
many cases
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know company a has nothing to do
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
on monday so they go
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
snooping around to see who they can can
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
pick up
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i i know that happens but
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's once
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know we just need to i get i
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just saying we just need to
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i i think that
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
if the if the truth were known if we
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
something like uh you know if it doesn't
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
work out
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
in three years we go back to where we
 
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.069 align:start position:0%
in three years we go back to where we
were

02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
i mean there's we have all kinds of
 
02:10:11.119 --> 02:10:12.629 align:start position:0%
i mean there's we have all kinds of
latitude

02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
in in hb2 as i think all of you know
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that um you know we're
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're not uh we're not
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh what do you want to say
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're not at in a in a position where
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
we can't make recommendations we can't i
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say recommendations
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
changes you know we have that
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have that authority
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
but i i don't want us to get stuck
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
in this in this thing that says well we
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
need to plan
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
for three years because
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
if the if the group
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's doing the planning isn't in
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
charge of the results
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
nothing gets done that's just my
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
my personal uh personal feeling
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so i just ask that we
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
think about this and by the way i
 
02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
think about this and by the way i
understand

02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
where all of you are coming from
 
02:11:25.630 --> 02:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
and i know that um this sort of
 
02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.270 align:start position:0%
and i know that um this sort of
[Music]

02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
institutional change if that's the right
 
02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.390 align:start position:0%
institutional change if that's the right
term

02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
is always always extremely difficult
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
now i cannot guarantee
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to the community college you know that
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
you will be
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
feel over time that you would be
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
swallowed up
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that whoever
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
is selected and oh by the way
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
we i don't think in the legislation it
 
02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.189 align:start position:0%
we i don't think in the legislation it
says

02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
these are new terms but i think we need
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
to make them new terms
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
so that if you know if joe
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
is selected to be on the um
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
from unh that he starts a new term he
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't try to
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know where he is in his
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
current term but
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
we've got to give this in my opinion
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
this newborn
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
some longevity and
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know and and synergy to work
 
02:12:27.119 --> 02:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
you know and and synergy to work
together

02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
and not not have joe's
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
term run out in a year or two years
 
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that's not in the legislation
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay so anyhow these are just some
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
random thoughts
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
that we will be discussing as we
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
move forward with this um
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
wednesday or thursday of next week
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i guess i i just
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
want to sort of
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
reinforce uh that my you know what
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
what you just said i think my view is is
 
02:13:08.239 --> 02:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
what you just said i think my view is is
uh

02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
really it does seem to me that
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
this the idea of
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
of this kind of a merger just
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentally makes sense
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
in light of the the
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know the numbers of students and the
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
the challenges that have been
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
have been put forward and you know in
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
that i completely understand that that
 
02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
that i completely understand that that
is

02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
that that's going to make a lot of
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
people very nervous
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
and and honestly i think if we were
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to be completely honest about it
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
say that we that we recognize that and
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and that the reality is that probably
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
some of them have things to be nervous
 
02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:51.990 align:start position:0%
some of them have things to be nervous
about

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
i mean you know it may it may well be
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying that this is
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
something that would be
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
would be happening under the specific
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know under the specific proposal
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
here but it may well be
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
that you know 10 years from now maybe
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
there aren't going to be seven community
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
colleges around the state
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe there isn't going to be a keene
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
state or a plymouth state maybe our
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
maybe the university
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
system is going to have to be cut back
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh in some way and if that's what
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense then you know we i i think
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have to be very careful that we not
 
02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
we have to be very careful that we not
turn

02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
turn
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
what is proposed here into something
 
02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.229 align:start position:0%
what is proposed here into something
like

02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know the base closure commission
 
02:14:35.199 --> 02:14:35.589 align:start position:0%
you know the base closure commission
where

02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know the nobody no no uh
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
no elected representative wants to be
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
in anything other than a yes and a yes
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
or no vote at the end
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be the ones
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
that say well
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it's actually true that
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth naval shipyard
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
is not really as important as nine other
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
as nine other uh bases around the
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
country i could
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
completely understand why if i was a
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
senator i wouldn't want to be the one
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
but it may be in fact that it's true and
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
i i think the points you make uh madam
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
chairman are
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
are very very important and i agree with
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
them wholeheartedly
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and maybe i'm
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
speaking a little out of turn here but
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking as a
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
former public school teacher and i'm
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
listening to this
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and thinking of the students involved
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm and i am concerned
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
i love four-year colleges
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
i love the students who go there i love
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
two-year colleges i love the
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
students who go there once upon a time
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
local high schools
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
offered academic subjects but they also
 
02:15:54.639 --> 02:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
offered academic subjects but they also
offered

02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
offered
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
trade subjects within the building
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
because they were
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
there were students who wanted those
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
there were students who just wanted to
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
try them out
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
and they were there and then
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
those disappeared and we went to a
 
02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:11.830 align:start position:0%
those disappeared and we went to a
technical

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
technical
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
school hub kind of thing
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
that essentially eliminated the kids
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
that wanted to just dabble and try them
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
out um
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i think we lost something in that i
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
think we lost something i think the
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
students lost something
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
with what uh susan hurt said
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
that eventually in this kind of merger
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose those students again
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose those students
 
02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
who aren't academic students
 
02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
who aren't academic students
[Music]

02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm really worried about that and i
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
put it out there i know it's this is
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
getting down personal but
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
i understand why people might want to do
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
it but we're not dealing with widgets
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
and we're not dealing with
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know vacuum cleaners we're dealing
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
with young people
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
and middle-aged people and their minds
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and their
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
in their uh their livelihoods and their
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
futures and
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
it's a big concern to me okay
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and uh if there's
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see anybody else's hand up
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
so um we will uh close our meeting
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
today and um
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
if you think this is a challenge wait
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
when we when we start talking about the
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
so um you know this one is easy compared
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
to whatever is going to happen on monday
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
and um then
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
one day this week i'm not sure which it
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
is we have to deal with
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission for discipline
 
02:18:06.639 --> 02:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission for discipline
of

02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
police officers you know so
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
we've got our hands full this next week
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um fortunately most of the things on the
 
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.070 align:start position:0%
um fortunately most of the things on the
um

02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know on the budget side we're in
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're in pretty good shape but we still
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
have some
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
pretty sticky issues in hb2 that we need
 
02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
pretty sticky issues in hb2 that we need
to

02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
we need to think about and
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
there was some uh questions about when
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendments can be submitted uh
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
for hb2 and um
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
that action can you know take place
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
because we'll be you know i
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
i would like if we could to handle the
 
02:18:58.240 --> 02:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
i would like if we could to handle the
amendments

02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
as we are talking about
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
the subject so if we get them prepared
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
then whatever the subject might be
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have the amendments
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that go along with uh with that
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
particular section
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess i will see you all on monday
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
at uh at 10 o'clock well i won't see all
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%

02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
which day we're going to be um
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
trying to come to grips with what's
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
going on with this particular section of
 
02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.389 align:start position:0%
going on with this particular section of
hb2

02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
so that you're not uh somebody is you
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
know you can have somebody at the
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
um if you want to talk you can talk if
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's okay too but uh but this you know
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna put us in this little you
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
know this little box
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh because although we uh although we
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
get to
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
make the final decision uh we're not
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh we all live in glass houses i'll put
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
so whatever we need to do anyhow so
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
