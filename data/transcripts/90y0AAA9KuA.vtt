00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing we have one

public hearing scheduled for 9:00 so
 
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get going with that but
 
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
Allegiance Scott do it I pledge Alle to
 
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 align:start position:0%

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.630 align:start position:0%
and to the repblic for it stands
na

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
na
 
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
for wonderful so we have a um pretty
 
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
full day so we're going to start with a
 
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing I was told by the clerk
 
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to start um a work
 
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
session until it's notice so
 
00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we'll have to wait until
 
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
11: for that but I believe that I can
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
get together with the ranking member um
 
00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
and the caucuses can happen in the
 
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
meantime if there's extra time um and
 
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
then at 11: we'll have a full committee
 
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
work session we have a few amendments on
 
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
bills uh I have a couple as well um so
 
00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 align:start position:0%
we can discuss those and then if we are
 
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough we can exec some
 
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
bills at 1:00 so with that I'm going to
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on hb1 1291 and
 
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
I want to welcome the prime sponsor to
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
your committee representative Reed thank
 
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you honorable
 
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Ellen
 
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
Reed I represent Rockingham ten which's
 
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
New Market and new Fields um the
 
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
background of this bill which was um a
 
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
almost identical Bill introduced last
 
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
year uh was that several years ago and I
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
want to be clear it was before uh 2020
 
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
it was 2018 or 2019 a constituent of
 
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
mine reached out to me because he wanted
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
to put a a essentially what we call an
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
ad or an in-law suite um in his existing
 
00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 align:start position:0%
detached garage so not building any more
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure than already existed but
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
just put it a place for his aging mother
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
to live and the town had denied him
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
because the existing detached garage
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to be attached to the
 
00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
primary dwelling and he wrote to me
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
saying what sense does this make in this
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
current housing crisis and remember it
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
was 2019 before the current current
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
housing crisis um and and his argument
 
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
was was quite solid so I reached out to
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
my then Town planner and said why are we
 
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
interpreting the law which uh the
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
current law as it existed as it exists
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
is from a law change a bill from about I
 
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
think 12 years ago um which guarantees
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
one Adu by right to every property
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
owner um but it says that the town can
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
require that it be attacked Ed and I
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
would asked my town planner at the time
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
um who is since left the position why
 
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
were we interpreting it interpreting
 
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
this in this overly restrictive way when
 
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
it really didn't change the rural
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
character you don't know if someone's
 
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
living in a garage when you drive past
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
and she told me and I said because we
 
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
need to we need to provide more
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for people and people
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
need to be able to build housing to do
 
00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
that and she said oh those people we do
 
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
enough for those people people they have
 
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
the trailers in the apartments that's
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
what she said to me and even though I am
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
the state representative for that town I
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
happen to live in an apartment so I said
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
I am one of those people so I set about
 
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
to change the fact that towns were
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to be overly restrictive with
 
00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
adus um I introduced the bill almost
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
identical to the current uh version
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
before you last year it went to a
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
different committee um but this
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee heard multiple hearings um
 
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
information gathering hearings from
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
multiple organizations most of which
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
presented information about the
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
necessity of adus and how they really
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
help fill what we call the middle uh the
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
missing middle for
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
housing and it turns out States
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere because the housing crisis
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
isn't just in New Hampshire but the
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
entire country it's especially severe in
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but States everywhere are
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
making these types of changes uh making
 
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
towns loosen up on their restrictive
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
zoning and in in particular on
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
adus um in particular we heard a very
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
indepth presentation on adus from uh The
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
mercus Institute from George Mason
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
University so adus are and these are
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units as you know the
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit of increased Supply
 
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 align:start position:0%
because it is homeowners who build a use
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
they tend to be high quality because
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to add something of
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
inferior quality to their own home and
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
they tend and they may in fact intend to
 
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
move into it later themselves so they
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
tend to be high quality they tend to be
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh low cost for the renter because
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
instead of it being a kind of corporate
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
landlord or a landlord that's in the
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
business of being a landlord it's
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
usually a person who just owns their own
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
home and wants to help uh defay the cost
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
of their own mortgage so because of that
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
they are typically high quality and low
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
cost which is exactly what we need um
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
they are also the gentlest density that
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
you can find because when you add an Adu
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
to a piece of property you usually don't
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
even know it's there you drive by and
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's in a garage or it's in a barn or it
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
just looks like a slightly bigger house
 
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
than it did before and you don't realize
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's an actual
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
apartment the people who rent adus often
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
have better relationships with their
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
landlords often have use of a yard
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
gardening ability to have pets because
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
they work in those relationships with
 
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
their landlord so all around it's a
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
win-win and for homeowners it is a huge
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
win because not only can they help um
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
the people who already have an Adu it
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
helps to fray their own mortgage but as
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to purchase a home it
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
helps you buy a home if you can get
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
rental income as part of the
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
consideration of your morgage
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
morgage so very few of the solutions
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we talk about when we talk about
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis help people buy homes
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
but home ownership is really the gold
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
standard not just rentals we talk about
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
things like large uh apartment complexes
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
that are lowincome and and other things
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
that people bulk at and it's not only
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
the people who have the nice houses in
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
those communities that bulk at it I can
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
tell you as someone who's lived in those
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
apartments almost all my life they're
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
not great to live in either most people
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
would rather live in an Adu than a big
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
complex but for those like I said I
 
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
really want to reiterate this because
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's important for those who are looking
 
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
to buy their own home and Home Ownership
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
is something that the more it increases
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
the more it benefits the entire
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Community across the board across pretty
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
much every metric it helps people having
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to build an Adu helps people
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
buy homes so as I said the law that it
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
current as it currently stands is every
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
homeowner has the right to build one Adu
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
the town can restrict it if it's not
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
attached and there are some other Common
 
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
Sense restrictions towns can can impose
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
like water and and uh and
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
septic um I will now this entire
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
committee not only heard hearings
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
informational hearings from
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
organizations but we had three work
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
sessions to Workshop this particular
 
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
language I have submitted this bill
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
according to the exact language that
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
this committee did a straw poll on um so
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
I will just quickly knowing that you all
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um as of last late last year already
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
went through this language I will still
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
quickly go through this language so
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
first of all it defines what an Adu is
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's a unit that is on the same lot as
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
the primary dwelling it can be a
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
attached which is defined as physically
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
connected to the the principal dwelling
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
unit or completely existing within a pre
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh a within a completely within a
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing detached structure because
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
cases uh they are not adding any
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
footprint you're not adding to like
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
affecting the Watershed you're not
 
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
building anything new a detached unit
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
would be neither within uh attached to
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
the house or within a pre-existing detou
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
structure and the reason that's defined
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
that way is because of the language that
 
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.550 align:start position:0%
that way is because of the language that
comes

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
later so right now there's one attached
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
by right uh this will allow that one
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
attached by right but allow one
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
additional one the the it will allow one
 
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
detached by right and allow one
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
additional one which then the town may
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
require to be attached but every
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner would now be allowed to build
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
one detached Adu and then be enti tital
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
to a second Adu if it is attached but
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
attached in that case still is within a
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
pre-existing structure as well so now
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
you have two adus by right um and also
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
the setbacks and aesthetic requirements
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
that town can place on an Adu in this in
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
this bill cannot be above what is put on
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
the principal dwelling
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
unit which is an addition I believe that
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
mercus then on the next page under uh
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 uh the original language
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
is it exists in the law uh said that
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
interior door would be provided this is
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
saying that as long as the Adu has the
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
independent means of Ingress egress
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh that they they shall not limit the
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
choice of in Ingress and egress meaning
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
that uh an interior door that connects
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
required again um other occupancy
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
standards are not beyond what is um
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
placed upon the principal dwelling
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
unit parking this committee uh talked
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about the parking
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that might be placed on an
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
on an Adu um I believe at the time we
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
were either 8 to2 or 9 to one that we
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
were okay with one un one parking space
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
per Adu being required um because we
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
were trying to get 100% cons consensus
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
we decided to go with one parking space
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
per bedroom however since we had that
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
meeting it has come to my attention that
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's not even necessarily the
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
requirement on principal dwelling units
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
single uh single family homes on their
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
own and uh we do have another bill that
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
would reduce it down to one parking spot
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
per unit across the board and so because
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
of that I do have an amendment that's
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
before you that would just bring it down
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
to a town could require one parking spot
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
per unit instead of one per bedroom um I
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
think that makes a lot of sense because
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
a lot we are trying to really have these
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
adus fill the missing mle which means
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
later on as I'll go uh go through we're
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
also increasing the square footage so
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
that people can really live in these
 
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.470 align:start position:0%
that people can really live in these
long-term

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
and if you have two bedrooms in your Adu
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
chances are you're probably you probably
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
drive um more uh saying aesthetic
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
standards have to be in line with the
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
primary structure so the laws that
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
exists currently says that town cannot
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
restrict an Adu to below 750 square ft
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
this raises it to 1,000 square ft for
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
one of the adus by R and 850 Square F
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
feet for any other unit again this is
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
what a town can restrict down to the
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
town does not have to restrict down to
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
but they cannot restrict beneath that
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
level also and this was um in order to
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
get around the very real problem of many
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
um units that are being built being
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
built specifically for the purpose of
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals and of course those
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't actually add to the supply for our
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
housing market we are saying that for
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
the second unit uh a town can say that
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
the Builder has to rent out at Workforce
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
housing levels which by default means
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
that it would not be able to be a
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
rental again this also allows uh adus to
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
be converted from existing
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
structures and I think oh and a town may
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
require a lot size of no more than 1
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
half acre in order to have the
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
additional Adu and that takes us through
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
the entire bill um essentially the bill
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
does not at all Impact that first Adu
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
that people um already have the right to
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
except to expand the the the size um but
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
it does allow a second Adu and reduces
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
the restrictions the town can
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
place in the creation of this bill both
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
originally and as we've gone through it
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
I consult with planners developers
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
Builders all of whom are very uh
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
supportive Realtors housing advocat
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
students really this is one of these
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
rare situations up here at the state
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
house where we have people from all
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
sides coming in in
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
support people who are both housing
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
Advocates and also private property
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
rights Advocates and those two you don't
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
normally get tenants and landlords
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
agreeing on much but this is the one
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
thing that they do agree on and with
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
that I've basically gone through the
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
idea and the bones I do want to say
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
though in general that um we really
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
really need to do something many states
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
are taking actions just like this but
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in particularly uh is
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
particularly impacted by the housing
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
crisis uh within 20 years we won't have
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
enough workers and I say young people uh
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
coming into the state we talk about the
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
gray of New Hampshire a lot but you have
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
to understand what young people even
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
means uh Millennials are in their
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
40s Millennials have wrinkles and gray
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
hair and in some cases Millennials have
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
children who can vote right so but these
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
are still the workers these are the
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
people who make our food and serve our
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
drinks and drive our propane trucks and
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh you can't have it both ways you
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
cannot have people driving your propane
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
trucks and making your food and
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
delivering your mail and then not make
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
room in your community for those people
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
so we really really need to do something
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
to help workers live in this state
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
because if we don't in 20 years there
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
won't be enough people work who can work
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
in this state to take care of all the
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
people who will be in nursing
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
homes and with that I'm happy to take
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
your testimony are questions for
 
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
your testimony are questions for
representative

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
Reed representative D
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question are you aware
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
that uh at Market Basket in uh stratum
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
there are so there are many many open
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
jobs and so few people willing or able
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
to work there that they're they have
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
actually imported people from the
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
Dominican Republic to work in that store
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative for
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
full disclosure both representative D
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo and I share a district and so we
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
both shop at the same Market Basket and
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
I am actually very familiar with that
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
because I have repeatedly gone up to the
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
New Market Basket employees and asked
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
them where a particular item was and
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
they were unable to um to communicate
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
with me because they didn't speak
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
English very well so you have kind of
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
hit the nail on the head in terms of
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
what the problem is we can't get young
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
people who work into this state to do
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
the jobs that we need in our communities
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
and so while I know that there's a lot
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
of people out there who may have bought
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
their homes in the 70s or 80s when the
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
cost of an average home was about one or
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
two years in average salary that's not
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the case anymore it's not even close to
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
the case anymore and so we can't use
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
those ideas of what the world was 40
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
years ago to to go forward from here we
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
can't get used to that and think that
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that those are the ways the communities
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
are always going to look because we have
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
to make room for those work workers in
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
today's market um because if we don't
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a really bad time in
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
this state in a few years so thank you
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
very much I do think that this again is
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
the lowest hanging fruit of all of the
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
solutions that we have before
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
us so okay thank you for your testimony
 
00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:20.510 align:start position:0%
us so okay thank you for your testimony
thank

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
testimony I wrote this for last time
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
which says good afternoon um so thank
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
you again for being here today and for U
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
making time to hear public testimony on
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
this issue I'll go ahead and um
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
introduce myself for the record my name
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
is Bryce Kao and for the past two years
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
I've served as chair of the Manchester
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
planning board past four I've been on
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
the board um first as an alternate then
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
as a full member and I'm here to provide
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
testimony on HB 1291 in my own personal
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
capacity um so I'd like to mention that
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
I strongly support HB 1291 relative to
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units Allowed by
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
Wright and I urge you all to support it
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
as well uh last year the Manchester
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
planning board led a push to l Adu
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions in the city of Manchester
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
um those zoning ordinance amendments
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
were eventually approved and enacted by
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
our previous Board of Mayor and Alderman
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
this year under a very different Board
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
of Mayor and Alderman we are considering
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
another set of positive changes this
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
time led by the mayor and our planning
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
staff the latest proposal would allow
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
all types of adus to be built uh by
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
right uh as long as they abide by
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
certain structural requirements thus
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating the need for homeowners to
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
go before the planning board for a
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit and the planning
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
board uh
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to support these
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
updates last month while we're pushing
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
forward at the municipal level hb1 1291
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
would help us all push forward at the
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
state level too uh we are in a housing
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
crisis as many people have said over the
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
past months and years and I think we
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
need to act like it the severity of this
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
moment means that we must take bold
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
actions to accelerate Housing
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
Development and to allow housing
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
development in the first place removing
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
barriers for new housing is the absolute
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
minimum and 8 use are the gentlest form
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
of density possible and to be fully
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
honest in my view anyone who opposes
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
expanding the construction of accessory
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
dwelling units is simply unserious about
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
genuinely addressing the housing crisis
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
so with all of this in mind I ask that
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
you support hb1 1291 as one important
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
step of many towards a comprehensive
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
housing solution thank you for your time
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and taking
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
my my question so I'm wondering if you
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
could clarify would 1291 if it become
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
statute be different from what
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester now has an ordinance I
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
believe it uh so to clarify it uh
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
currently the newly proposed zoning
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
changes have just completed a special
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in Manchester So
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
currently uh not all adus are allowed by
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
right however I'm optimistic that within
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
the next month they will be um hb1 1291
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
on top of that would U allow I believe a
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
second Adu unit whereas under our
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
proposed zoning changes in Manchester I
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
believe it is still limited to just one
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
unit on the property um and the uh bill
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
sponse would probably be more
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about some of the other
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
minute details um in Manchester we do
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
currently limit the parking requirements
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
to just one space per unit um but other
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
than that I'd be happy to answer other
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
you represent brudy thank you m chairman
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh good morning have have we or the city
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
of Manchester denied anybody or Adu yet
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge there has been some
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth over time with regards to
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
aesthetic concerns um however in those
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
situations we always came to a solution
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
and those aesthetic concerns are um
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually encoded in the newly proposed
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances so it wouldn't be an
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
issue moving forward thank
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:35.789 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
um you said that you that the Manchester
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
is changing their um requirements as far
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
as adus and you kept on using the word
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
all like all adus are allowed and then
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
you went on to say only one is allowed
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
so can you clarify what do you mean by
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
all do you mean detached versus attached
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes so attached versus detached versus
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
internal okay um currently under the
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
current ordinances that we adopted last
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
year um we allow internal adus for
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
example a basement conversion by right
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh does not have to go before the
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
planning board anything that requires
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
external construction um is currently
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
required to go before the planning board
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
for a conditional use permit the
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
planning board is very much on board
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
with the IDE and we're hopeful that the
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
BMA will approve it um where regardless
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
of what style of Adu
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
um like whether it's external or
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
internal it does not require a
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit as long as it
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
abides by the aesthetic requirements
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
like same materials um No taller than
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
the principal structure a certain
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the principal structure so
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's still accessory that sort of
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
thing that would be in the zoning
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance representative
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you could you speak to some
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
numbers for Manchester how present are
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
adus how much interest there is
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
something along those yeah we've had
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple dozen applications over
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the past few years for adus um and part
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
of the limitation in my view is that uh
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
when people have to go through such a
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
process it winds up being a bit
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
intimidating and they're not necessarily
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
as interested in doing that um however
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
we don't quite know what the future will
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
hold um but over the next couple years
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
we would have an idea like the
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
difference uh if we do manage to loosen
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
the restrictions
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
further represent thank you thank you
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
for taking another question um have you
 
00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.070 align:start position:0%
for taking another question um have you
experienced

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.510 align:start position:0%
experienced
any

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh or aware of any uh requests for a
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
variance so that a second Adu can be uh
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
constructed or have have you has anyone
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
that has uh you know adopted a or put a
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
Adu in said oh I wish I could have
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
another one is this is this mostly just
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
cleanup of the original language or is
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
there really a desire for additional Adu
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing on the ground um I
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
personally have not seen any requests
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
like that um that would go first to the
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
zoning board uh and then secondarily to
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
the planning board and uh so nothing has
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
made it to the planning board stage at
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
however um regardless of how I guess
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
common the desire is for a second unit
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
um if it is something that this
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee would think is reasonable then
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
I would certainly encourage you all to
 
00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:41.230 align:start position:0%
I would certainly encourage you all to
support

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you for your testimony
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
GRE thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we we do oppose
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation we do have a policy
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
position to oppose all Statewide land
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
use mandates and therefore we oppose um
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation that would uh impose a
 
00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:11.799 align:start position:0%
Statewide land use mandate to require uh
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
additional adus as well as detached
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
adus um I have submitted written
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony so you should have that in
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
front of you and I also uploaded that
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
online a couple weeks ago um I do want
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
to address a couple points in of the
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
bill that are not in the written
 
00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:28.230 align:start position:0%
bill that are not in the written
testimony

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
um I or I guess more shortly in the
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
written testimony um I do want to thank
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor for reaching out um
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
and talking with me about some of our
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
concerns um and I do think that it is
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
important as you work towards a solution
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
to the housing shortage that you do
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
consider how um the policies you you
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
pass or uh suggest the House pass um
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
impacts the type of housing built in
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
this state um I know that my friend Ben
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
Frost is behind me and there is one
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
thing that I certainly agree with him on
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
which is that we do need a diversity of
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
housing types in this state um and one
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
of those is Workforce housing and we've
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
we've been working very hard with with
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
him and others to uh come up with
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
solutions to that and to that end I do
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
think the provision in this legislation
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
about um allowing a local option to uh
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
Target the uh use of the second Adu to
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
be Workforce housing is important um
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
because we have seen in communities like
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
Conway that um there are incentives to
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
build adus and other structures and then
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
rent those out as short-term rentals but
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're hearing from
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
businesses on Main Street that they
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't have enough
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
workers um so we need to figure out how
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
to come up with solutions to that um and
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
to that end I think that communities
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
across the state have been doing a very
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
good job in my written test Tony I
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
provided you a short list of communities
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
and online um the the blue highlighted
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
our actual links to um zoning ordinances
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
that have passed last year of course
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
town meeting is um next week so we'll
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
see uh what additional ordinances may
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
pass uh across the state but um
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
communities where we have seen high
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
levels of development have looked at
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
adus they've been expanding um and
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
changing how exactly those are
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
integrated into their Community um and I
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
think they're doing a good job um to
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
that effect um and when you look at kind
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
of the penetration of adus throughout
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
the state as compared to other states I
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
know mercatus uh provided you
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
information um I summar I I quoted a
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
short uh set of that information for you
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
um that really just illustrates that
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
adus are being adopted at a higher rate
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
in our state than they are at some other
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
states where um they've been championed
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and where they have some of these
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
these these um additional mandates in
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
place um so we think that the the state
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
and at the local level were responding
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
well to uh the demands from the market
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
in this particular area and I would urge
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
you to uh reject this legislation I'm
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you for your
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
testimony represent VI Kella thank you
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um it
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
seems like your uh testimony is that the
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities are doing such a great
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
job in allowing
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
adus um and that it's being adopted a
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
lot uh around the state however
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
the um are how many municipalities
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
before the state mandated that they have
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
adus um were utilizing uh adus and was
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
that Trend um did the did the New
 
00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
um you know uh put gasoline on that fire
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
with with the uh
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
the the uh mandate that they allow
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
municip uh adus or or was that happening
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
pre the state doing anything so uh as
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
mercus reported uh to the committee I
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe anyone was collecting data
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
on that um I believe that uh Bea is
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking at collecting uh a different
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
type of reporting um so that they can
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
keep track of adus I'm not sure whether
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to go in effect or not um
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
but that's not something that's tracked
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
at the Statewide level so I don't have a
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
full picture I can tell you anecdotally
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
from the city of Kean that they adopted
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
an Adu provision before the legislation
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
was put into effect back in
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
2017 um frankly they haven't seen that
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
many adus being proposed um they they
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
did adopt uh a couple years ago a very
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
broad um Prov Vision that that allows I
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
believe detached um adus it's Linked In
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
My article um and one of the the things
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
they just haven't seen an upsell in
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
demand for that type of development um
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
they've certainly seen an upswell in
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
demand of other types of development
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
multif family units Etc as they've
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
looked at changing that but they just
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the the type of demand um I
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
just don't I don't foresee this having a
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the housing
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:29.509 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the housing
shortage

00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
follow thank you um thank you for your
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
uh comments
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
it's it definitely does seem from your
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
from your comments that you're kind of
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
taking it uh incred for the for the
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
state's uh mandate however I guess my
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
question my follow-up for that is um do
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
you see any of the
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
um things adjusted in
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
this uh bill as regarding the regular
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
first um Adu that it now
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
be uh requ required to be uh given by
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
right instead of for the first Adu you
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
be able to have a require people to go
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
to uh planning boards and stuff like
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
that now that all of those that the Adu
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh is is more familiar by municipalities
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
do you see that
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
um there still needs to be for that
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
first Adu uh public hearing and or going
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the zba and paying paying those fees
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
and incurring additional cost to to that
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
development or do you believe that um
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
moving it to a matter of right is is
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
generally in land use law we've seen
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
that uh when someone owns a particular
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
piece of property they want to do any
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
sort of development on that property um
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's good form to inform the neighbors
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
and have a hearing so you can determine
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's an appropriate use
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
of land um and that is something that
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislature put into into
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
effect quite a long time ago and may be
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
adjusting slightly um in the near future
 
00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:25.350 align:start position:0%
adjusting slightly um in the near future
but

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
um generally uh you know zoning is is a
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
a bundle of Rights and part of that is
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
that you know you have uh collectively
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
the community comes together to decide
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
how they they want development to
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
proceed um where they want development
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
to proceed and there are you know
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
obviously different policy options for
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
that um so you know I don't think moving
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
moving development to by right um is
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to change the
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
direction of development because we're
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
still going to have to look at the
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
economic realities of it and I just
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't foresee that this is going to have
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
a significant impact um even if passed
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
on um the housing shortage and we've
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
seen high demand areas um we've seen
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
more um you know areas where you have
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
more more jobs more people more uh
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce places like uh Manchester where
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
um they have made uh adjustments um and
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
so they are doing this type of thing I
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
just don't foresee a lot of development
 
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.389 align:start position:0%
just don't foresee a lot of development
occurring

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
just by simple economics in in very
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
rural areas um to the same extent that
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
you would hear um in the urban areas
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions representative D Lorenzo
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um how do
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities um distinguish between an
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.829 align:start position:0%
 
apartment

00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
so I think there are specific
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for the Adu with it being
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
separate um under the building and and
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
fire codes but I'm not familiar with
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
those um I believe there's some experts
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
behind me who could answer your question
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
better than I could thank
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
chair um you've mentioned uh
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
that municipalities are um uh on their
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
own going ahead with allowing
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
adus um but those seem to be uh
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions that would allow a single Adu
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
whereas this proposed uh bill would
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
allow two adus as of right uh do you see
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
any likelihood that municipalities will
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
move from allowing one Adu to allowing
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
two well I know Enfield has has done so
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I don't think that's
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
been an effect long enough to to see
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of effect that would have if
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
any on development there um I believe
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
that only happened last year but um you
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
know one of the one of the great things
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
about local control with zoning is you
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
get a uh basically functions the same
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
way at the state level as the states do
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the federal government we get to try
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
different things see what works and then
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
good ideas spread naturally so that's
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
what we that's what we see happening
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we hope will happen and I I
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you thank you for your
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for being here today
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing me testify my
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
name is Vanessa Blaze and I serve as the
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
director of policy and planning for the
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council on developmental
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities our Council by law is
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
comprised of 60% of people with
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and or their
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
Guardians and they are members who are
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
volunteering for disability Justice and
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
they believe that the expansion of
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
rights to build accessory dwelling units
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
without the barriers of added cost and
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
additional red tape would have a
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the lives of people
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
with intellectual and develop mental
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the people who support
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
them as we are aware there is a severe
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
housing crisis happening in our state
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
and this crisis disproportionately
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
affects those in the developmental
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
disability Community The increased
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
allowance of construction of adus in our
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%

in place and to the people who support
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
them this crisis has forced parents to
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
reconsider group homes for their adult
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
children something that New Hampshire
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
has decided to abolish with the promise
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
of supporting disabled people to live

them disabled people should not have to
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
expect to wait longer for safe stable
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
and appropriate homes where they can

and taking my
question

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
are there federal funds or other funds
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
that would help the population you're
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
representing if adus are legislated to
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
be easier to create are there federal
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds to help people do that for that
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
population there are not the uh mandate
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal government is that um
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
housing thank you
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%

Kell thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.390 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
um you talked a little bit last time
 
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
um you talked a little bit last time
about

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.349 align:start position:0%
about
the

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
the wanting or Desiring of support um
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes for people with
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and the type of of
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
housing that that that may accommodate
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um and we talked about um like
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
having people on staff and and uh having
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
multiple um units where people you know
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
that person on staff can really um help
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
possibly multiple people um do you
 
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
possibly multiple people um do you
believe

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
that that this that this is kind of uh
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
serving that same purpose or do you or
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
do you see that this is more about uh
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
that this would might be apply more
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
to um uh a family that wants some
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
Independence uh for uh you know relative
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
that is disabled and they would be it
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessarily a hired um
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
person being being uh providing the
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
services in that case but probably a
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
family member if if it was utilizing
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
this structure versus the structure that
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
we were talking about before
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
um or if you um if you have any data
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
about uh or any information about how
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
often uh currently um adus are being
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
used for um allowing some you know
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
independence from from people with
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities while having that same uh
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
support structure I guess readily
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
available thank you for the question I
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
believe we believe that the um option of
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
having adus can serve both the family
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
unit and um an opportunity to have
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
support available um within close
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
proximity um it's also an opportunity to
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
have um what we think of as lifespan
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
housing so we having an Adu would give
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
you a chance to age in place whether or
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
not you wanted to move into an Adu and
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
have your natural supports or paid
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
supports live in the main home or vice
 
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.630 align:start position:0%
supports live in the main home or vice
versa

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
versa
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't have exact data on how many
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disability in
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
the state are utilizing adus I have
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data um which the answer is
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
that um it is one one of the main
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
solutions that parents mainly are
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
looking for um it is unfortunately
 
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.950 align:start position:0%
looking for um it is unfortunately
extremely

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
expensive and so what we are looking for
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
is opportunities for people to take
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of the ability to build an Adu
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
without the added cost and without all
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the red tape that people have to go
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
through right
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
now quick follow up yeah absolutely so
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
you talked about the red tape um and
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get rid of the red tape um
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
what specifically I guess is uh my
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
question is the red tape that you're
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
seeing is is the most important thing
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know these the that this first Adu
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
be allowed by right and not have to go
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
through to a zba meeting or a planning
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
board meeting and be able to just be
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
like here's my plan go to the building
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
in uh inspector and and get your
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
building permit and start going what
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
what is the real you know red tape that
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
you're seeing as the
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
barrier that's correct being having to
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
go through the zoning board the planning
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
board the cost of the permits um even
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
for many people just understanding the
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
process um if you don't completely
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
understand the process you can reach a
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
point in that process where you have to
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
go back to the drawing board and every
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
time you do that it costs more money
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
my question uh you mentioned that there
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
was a federal mandate that funds uh
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
could not be used for housing uh I
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
expect those were Health and Human
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
Services funds um have you looked at HUD
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
Development Federal Department of
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development funding
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
for housing for people with disabilities
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
such as uh the program C SE 8
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
11 thank you for the question Medicaid
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
funding cannot be used um towards
 
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.390 align:start position:0%
funding cannot be used um towards
housing

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
um the federal funding that goes through
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
HUD for Section 8 housing um which is
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
considered the mainstream Voucher
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
Program I'm assuming you're referring to
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
um just the typical uh excuse me no I
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
was referring to a specific program that
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
is housing for people with disabilities
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
called section
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
811 right um so that is it's not it's
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
not Section 8 it's a totally different
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
program right and
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
um in theory that is a great program
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
however because of the housing
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
crisis it is very difficult for people
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
to actually find a place to live using
 
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
the vou V
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
program um I don't know if you know this
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
but um the city of conquer is actually
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
pausing adding people to the wait list
 
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
for their voucher program and there's
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
now 30 families in the city of conquer
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
who have vouchers but don't have
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere to live um I think that's like
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
a Upstream issue that's an even bigger
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
issue than this discussion right now um
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I also want to add that uh
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
section the the voucher program is a
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful program however it doesn't
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
address the needs of people who need
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
support in order to be able to live
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
independently followup followup thank
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
you um uh sorry we're still not quite on
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
the same page um the section 811 program
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
that I was referring to is not a voucher
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
program it's a program to create housing
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
for people with disability specifically
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a competitive program that
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
organizations have to apply for so I'm
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
not saying this is something that's easy
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
to get but I'm just suggesting that it
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
might be something to look into because
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
it can actually help you to create
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
housing rather than just to um uh let
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
people apply for vouchers which I'm
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
fully aware can be very difficult to get
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
and very difficult to use once uh the
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
applicant has a
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
voucher thank you okay any other
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
you do you have written testimony okay
 
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.109 align:start position:0%
you do you have written testimony okay
thank

00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.069 align:start position:0%
 
Holland

00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chair and committee
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
speak today and um to have this hearing
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
ing at a time that is not really um
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
constrained so we appreciate
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
that um my name is Sarah Holland I'm the
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
vice chair of public policy for the New
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Realtors and I am here on
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Realtors who ask you to
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
support hb1
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
1291 this is a private property rights
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
issue it's the use um if the use of
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
private property does not create a
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
health or safety issue and owners should
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
be able to use the property as they see
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
fit we're not asking you to allow a
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
property owner to construct an Adu we're
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
asking you to memorialize their right to
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
add an Adu absent a compelling reason
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
not to which there are seemingly none of
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
course there is um if there is or when
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is an Urgent health or safety
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
issue that may negatively impact the
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
community or the occupants then the
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
government should of course take action
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
however before voting we would implore
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
that you consider the mechanisms that
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have um and will
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
retain under this bill to regulate the
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
health and safety of these
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
is something that already um regulate is
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
already regulated by Dees including any
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional occupancy space on a property
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
so if you um increase your load um then
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
you need to increase the size of your
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
septic that is already regulated um if
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
you cannot increase the size of your
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
septic then you cannot be approved for
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
an Adu water if there's no access to
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
pable water you cannot be approved for
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
an Adu sufficient space if a property
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
does not have a spe sufficient space to
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
add an Adu given a myriad of regulations
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
like setbacks Wetlands um radii from
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
private Wells you cannot be approved
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
from for an
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
Adu a municipality retains much of its
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
authority to protect the health and
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
safety of the occupants and the
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
community members this bill does not
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
change that um there have been many
 
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the barriers to adus um
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to um discuss some of
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
those so the current process for which
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
an Adu or any substantive change to a
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
property um it
 
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of time a lot of effort
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
from the applicant um it requires
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
hearings and site plan drawings which
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
can be expensive to produce and this is
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
just in the hopes that you'll be
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
approved there's really no mechanism to
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
appr approach a land use board and say
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
hey if I apply will I be approved they
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
do not like to talk in hypothetical so
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
you have to go through the process for a
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
maybe you're unsure if you're actually
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to be approved um in my town um we
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
did move forward obviously with the um
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
Adu law that was enacted six years ago
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
and however mine chose to um restrict or
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
create additional rules around detached
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
adus so my house I have um a single
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
family home on a 1acre lot with a
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
detached garage um my neighbor has an
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
attached garage he can build without an
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
an Adu without any um additional Hoops I
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
would either need to quadruple the size
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
of my lot construct a connection between
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
my garage or my house and my house or I
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
would need to go through the lengthy
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
approval process without any guarantees
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I currently have well I do have
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
three adult children that have
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
previously left the state to find
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
employment and housing one has returned
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
we would love to um help them get into a
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
house of their own of course the housing
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
crisis um so we would love to give them
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
another space to have their privacy and
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately without going through any
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
of those Hoops we are unable to do that
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill will allow us to construct
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um an Adu above our garage maybe in in
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
our basement to allow myself to age in
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
place um over time to be able to bring
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
in my aging parents to have our adult
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
children to have their own space um so
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
this is um something that we support as
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
an association but also individually and
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to being denied um an
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
application for an Adu it's not
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily that folks are going forward
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
and being denied these applications it's
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at this criteria and
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
self-excluding we're saying that doesn't
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
fit and I just simply don't have the
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
time or the resources to go through this
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
so we feel that um that is why so few
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
have been built since the law went into
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
effect in the last six years the hurdles
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
the confusion and the cost and time
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
associated with that may be so under hp1
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
1291 towns retain their local control in
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
order to relate uh regulate legitimate
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
health and safety concerns and and it's
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
also worth mentioning that New Hampshire
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
is not a home rule state all
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
municipality Authority regarding zoning
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
was provided to them by the state of New
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you um so however they were
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
granted the authority to diminish an
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
individual's private property rights by
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
denying them the right to build an
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
attached or detached Adu even if there's
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
no legitimate health or safety rationale
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
hb1 1291 appropriately gives property
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
owners some of their property rights
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
back while the municipalities maintain
 
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable Authority to safeguard their
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
communities we ask you to support
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
1291 thank you for your testimony any
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for uh
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I'm sure I will
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
have a few um have you heard of any
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
people trying to like in your in your
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
town um might have a detached garage
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
with similar type of rules where they
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
have essentially constructed a large
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
hallway in between the the uh detach
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
garage and the primary structure so that
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
they can kind of get around that rule of
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
detaching you know that uh
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities have kind of created this
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
arbitrary uh guidance or requirement
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
that you know there
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
being interior connecting door or
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
something along those lines so I have
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
not heard of that being the case in my
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
town but that was a consideration our
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
consideration for hours oh well what is
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of US attaching the house does
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
it or to the garage does that make sense
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
what will that look like um and then you
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
know we just self-excluded that we're
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
not going to move
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward FYI it's happened in my town and
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
and once you got approved like that that
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
hallway could theoretically just
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
disappear um but
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
the and then it would be
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
detached Adu um so the
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh the uh it seems like one of your
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
um one of your main kind of focuses are
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
are on
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
this like this real value of the the
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
change to the first Adu of that that um
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
both uh the first attached or detached
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
is allowed as a matter of right um and
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
that you believe to be maybe the biggest
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
impact of of this legislation uh is that
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
correct yeah we we support all of it of
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
course but the barriers to adding those
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
adus would essentially disappear with
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
that first one by right
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely Al
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
set yes no one else
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
um sure uh thanks for for taking another
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
question so in
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
experience in your local municipality um
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
have you seen or or any that you've
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with have you seen any other
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
restrictions um one of the ones that
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
jumps out to me seems to be that we are
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
now not going to allow more than uh
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
um a minimum lot size of a half acre for
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
the second uh accessory dwelling that
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
would not um being com uh that would
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
make your municipality have to change
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
their rules as as you kind of previously
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
stated have
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
you uh any any thoughts or or concerns
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
these other types of barriers that
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities are putting up whether it
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
be requiring you to increase the size of
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
your lot or or
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh um you know parking or whatever the
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
case may be um that maybe we haven't
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
addressed fully in this bill that you
 
00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:15.559 align:start position:0%
see as barriers uh nothing that jumps
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
out um what my experience is over the
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
last 12 years in real estate and working
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
with buyers and sellers and Property
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
Owners relative to private property
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
rights is is
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
that communities can be very creative in
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
finding ways to ban certain things that
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
they do not agree with so I think this
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
is a great place to start I would love
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
for this to move forward and then we
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
will just have to address any of the
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
other issues that come up
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
later please quick H have you uh in your
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
experience heard of any desire for the
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
second Adu is that um getting squ washed
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere that you've heard of or or is
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
it mostly just the access to the first
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
Adu that is the biggest hurdle to this I
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a conversation that's
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
happening right now regarding the
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
current housing crisis so as I explained
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
with my three adult children um and my
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
aging parents as well as myself over
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
time um being able to transition within
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
your own property is a really great
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity so um having the first one
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
by right is a tremendous step having a
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
sec one second one as we became empty
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
nesters we had all of this space and a
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
lot of the conversation was where do we
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
go now we don't need all of this space
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
um there's nowhere to go so what do we
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
do with what we have here and how do we
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
prepare our family for the future and
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
just the whole economic Outlook so um I
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
think a lot of folks are having this
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
conversation I don't know that it's
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually being um outright band in any
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
specific way um but being able to
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
FastTrack it and have it be a viable
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
option for folks is super
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
powerful representative Damon thank you
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question could
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
you speak to what you and your
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
Association are seeing or have
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
seen in regards to both presence of and
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
interest in adus contrasted between our
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
cities and our rural areas and small
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
communities I think the need is there
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
across the board I live in a rural
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
Community um I work with a lot of
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
clients that are in more urbanized
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
communities and the the conversation is
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
the same we need more housing we need
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
housing thank you and
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
separately what input might you have on
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
adus so the investment piece for the
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
property owner to um input uh or to
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
create an Adu in their space um has an
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
ex expectation of a return on that
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
investment for them to be able to age in
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
place live in their homes continue to
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
stay there and not be forced out um it
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
creates a marketability if they were to
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
sell their homes um for folks who are
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
looking for very similar situations so I
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
win-win what are you seeing in terms of
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
people being able
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
to get a mortgage or or some kind of
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
financing to add an Adu if they don't
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
Capital that's a really great question I
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
I am I'm a realtor I am not um A lender
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
but um the conversation is happening
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're finding that there are um it's
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
definitely something that is positive on
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
the purchase aspect of a property if
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
there is an Adu you can use that
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
additional income to qualify for a
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
property that you may not otherwise
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for um to be able to tap into
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
the equity there are just a lot of
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
different um mechanisms um but I think
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
that anyone that is interested that
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
should have those conversations with a
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
lender with a Community member to be
 
01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
able to explore if that is viable for
 
01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
able to explore if that is viable for
them

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
yep so I'm interested in what you could
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
tell us about the amount of increased
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
value to a single home that then adds
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
one or two
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
adus con not contrasted with but I know
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
for instance if you remodel your kitchen
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
your bath you almost always economically
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
that adds enough value to the house it's
 
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:41.549 align:start position:0%
that adds enough value to the house it's
considered

01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
worthwhile how much value do a use add
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
property it's a hard question to answer
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the location and the prop
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
property specific itself whether or not
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
it is used as an additional living space
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
um for a family member or if it is
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
actually being rented out for income um
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
so that takes into account but it what
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
it does is it becomes more attractive
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
overall to buyers because of the
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
versatility so um with supply and demand
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
and the attractiveness of course that is
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
going to be an increased in increased
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
value um I have a quick question based
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
on your experience have you seen um a
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
diminished property value of the butters
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
of properties with adus no you have not
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
seen that no thank you any other
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
marglin thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
Alysa Marg I serve as director of
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire we're in
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
support strong support of House Bill
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
1291 and the amendment as well uh the
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh introduced that
 
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh regarding one parking space per unit
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
instead of per
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
bedroom um I thought it would be helpful
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh given that you um have already walked
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
through the details of the bill and
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
heard strong support from various
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
constituencies just to talk about our uh
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
active involvement in the passage of the
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
original du law back in
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
2016 um we had partnered then with the
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
DD Council and
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
ARP um and help bring forth the voices
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
about the housing challenges of over
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
adults and we brought uh uh uh to the
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
legislature um voices of parents with uh
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh adult children with disabilities
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
really looking for Adu Solutions at the
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
time um we also had a governor who had
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
direct experience with having to um give
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
up uh Dream Home opportunities in order
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
to find a municipality that would
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
accommodate um uh an Adu uh so that um
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
her her son could uh continue to live
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
with them I think eight years later we
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
are really now in a position to improve
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
this law um Mr Grace brought up um The
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
mercus Institute and uh I remember I
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
recall one of your many working sessions
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
when mercus presented to this committee
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
and talked about their efforts to have
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh Adu laws uh in every state in the
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
country um and reviewed our law and said
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh but the New Hampshire law is weak and
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
I want to acknowledge the sting I felt
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
that day sitting in your committee room
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
because of our um our work on it um but
 
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.150 align:start position:0%
because of our um our work on it um but
um

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I do recall that there were
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
as as you know so well so many
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
compromises that were made in order to
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
push that forward and I think that what
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
we are essentially saying
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
is there were too many compromises made
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
and it's not really working as well as
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
it could um and uh you know for for an
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
organization like housing action New
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we support accessory dwelling
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
units we're particularly happy to see
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
that you know for the second Adu here
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
that a municipality could require income
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
targeting you know for us it's not the
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
Silver Bullet like we very much you know
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
are encouraging multif family
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing you know diverse
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
housing stock things you know proposals
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that you on this committee have really
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
explored but we have an Adu law on the
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
books let's make it work for people and
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh so um and it also you know helps
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
preserve rural character and Rural
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
communities it's that um as my colleague
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
Sarah ritesman who's here today reminds
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
me you know this is gentle density and
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's very much an aesthetic uh that uh
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
is useful um to Granite Staters who
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
already have single family and a and a
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
good use of um uh current infrastructure
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
and new infrastructure so we urge your
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
support and I'm happy to take any
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
testimony represent viella thank you
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking the question
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
um I happen to be at one of my uh
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities budget or or planning
 
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.670 align:start position:0%
municipalities budget or or planning
board

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
um um before I think the final language
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of this or maybe even after the final
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
language of this came out um they
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
expressed mainly their concern about
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
um the parking spaces and only being
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
able to require one if they're you know
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
if someone is is
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
having uh three
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
bedrooms in this Adu if they don't if
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
they don't cap the size right if they if
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
you leave it to however much as long as
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's smaller than the house and you have
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
a giant house you could potentially have
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
a three-bedroom Adu and if that had two
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
adults or whatever and maybe an adult
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
child in it you could potentially have
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
three cars and they wanted to you
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
know they said that that was a big
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
concern essentially for their that
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
Community um so do you think that that
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
um that is an unjustified concern and
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that we should you know uh uh
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
amend for sure and say that's that's you
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
know unjust ified we're just going to
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
make that not possible in your
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
municipality um for you to say like hey
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom can require three three
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
parking spaces or whatever um or do you
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
do you believe that you know the the
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
compromises let's say with this bill are
 
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.829 align:start position:0%
compromises let's say with this bill are
actually

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
significantly um valuable for the first
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
Adu and and uh that it's that it's uh
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
positive without that Amendment uhk you
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
for the question I think it's excellent
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I wanted to
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
articulate our support for
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reed's Amendment um is uh
 
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
is connected to um one of the CH current
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
challenges with our current law um you
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
recall the presentation uh uh regarding
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire zoning Atlas just a
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
really uh important data set that has
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
come out of the center for ethics and
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
Society at St ansam college and um they
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
identified uh communities that have
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
created uh ordinances that require four
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
parking spots per Adu and essentially
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
using that you know to just um as a
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
barrier you know for uh a private
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
property rights for for an option for a
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
homeowner to do something so um because
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
of that I think you know parking is uh
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
really important I I I mean I uh I don't
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
know that housing action you Hampshire
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
has a position like broadly but I would
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
say personally I think there is some
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal interest in parking but I
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
think that it's we should have
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable um requirements and I think
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
one per unit makes a lot of sense uh
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
that the MC the representative MC
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
Williams bill that you're considering
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
also makes a lot of sense and um in the
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
adus in my community um both of them are
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh aging parents who no longer Drive and
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
they don't use any parking uh so uh just
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
made room for growing teenage kids in
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
the in the you know kids house next door
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
to to use the spot but uh yeah I think I
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
don't think I I think you should in
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
incorporate the amendment if you have
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
the um support on the committee to do
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm representative Wallace thank you
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thanks for taking my
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
question um have you heard any
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities say that we have a
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
parking problem here in New Hampshire or
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much the housing problem that we
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
had to address um I mean I uh I live in
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the city of Portsmith and you know
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
parking is a is a is a hot issue um uh
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
so but I uh I
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't I think we have a housing crisis
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have a parking crisis and I
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
parking uh the over requirement of
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
parking is a barrier to to density it's
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
a barrier to safe saing our natural
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
spaces and it's often unnecessary I I do
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
think that there is some Municipal
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
interest in uh in there but I I I don't
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
think in this case for an Adu that's not
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to house you know hundreds of
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
people at a time I think that uh it
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be an excessive
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
requirement around
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you for your testimony
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
Frost

01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman and good
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
morning committee members I'm Ben Frost
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy director and chief legal
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
officer at New Hampshire housing it is
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh a pleasure to be with you this
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
morning on this beautiful day and to
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
express New Hampshire housing's
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic support for house
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
1291 um you've heard a lot of testimony
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
about uh need and there have been a lot
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
of questions asked and I'd like to come
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
back to some of those questions um as I
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
as I speak um I'll just note that um as
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
Alysa marglin uh recounted the 2016
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislation creating the the Adu law uh
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
was really well supported in the the
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives a majority of
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
both Republicans and Democrats voted in
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
favor of it
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
um and it was uh largely because of this
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
this question of property rights what
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
can individual homeowners do with their
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
property in a in a reasonable
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
fashion um accessory dwelling units are
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the best options we have
 
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
to increase uh Supply in and of our
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
housing and to do so uh really without
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
public subsidy uh this is up to private
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
property owners to figure out whether
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
they want to do it and then if so how to
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
do it um
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
and and certainly what we've seen coming
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
out of the the uh existing law is no
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Community being flooded by adus as was
 
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
initially suggested uh but really
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
incremental small scale development
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
one-off development because it relies on
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
an individual homeowner to do something
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's not something that developers are
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
doing large scale it's it's individual
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners acting in their own interests
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
it is as has been called a gentle
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
density small scale infill uh and yet
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
despite all of these positive attributes
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are a number of communities that
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
are making it really really really
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
really hard uh to do uh accessory
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
dwelling units the need now is so great
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
and so urgent that we need to do as much
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
as we can as soon as we can we can't uh
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
try just one thing and and hope that it
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
works and then a few years later say
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
well it didn't didn't do enough let's do
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
do something else uh we need to do many
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
things now House Bill 1291 is one of
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
those things we also can't rely solely
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
on the good graces of places like
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Kean which are doing uh
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
awesome things um it requires proactive
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislation like this if you really want
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
to achieve something that is to address
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh the state's uh housing Supply crisis
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
then it makes to eliminate the barriers
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
to doing that and house B 1291 does
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
that um I'd like to turn to a couple of
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
questions that have already been asked
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll start with um representative
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
Damon you asked about the economics of
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units and financing
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm delighted to say that the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
Brookings institution just in the past
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
week published an analysis of uh the
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
economics of accessory dwelling unit l
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
just uh in in the Los Angeles area and I
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
say well that's Los Angeles well okay
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
money is money uh and the economics of
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
development in Los Angeles although it's
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
higher there than it is in New Hampshire
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's still dollars for dollars or
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
dollars so I think that the analysis
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
done by brookens is um highly
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
instructive and it indicates that even
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
without subsidy there is some room for
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners to do this in a way that is
 
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
is profitable uh C certainly the they
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
they also argue that it's helpful to
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
have subsidies such as a housing Choice
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
voucher uh to accompany that but it's
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
not absolutely necessary regarding
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
financing I'm also really happy to say
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh Federal housing
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
Administration has uh recently in the
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
past year changed uh some of its
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
underwriting standards and so we see uh
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
programs uh lending programs coming
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
forth from Fanny May and Freddy Mack
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
that allow for the income associated
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
with uh accessory dwelling units that is
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
the rental income to be counted as part
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
of the the financing of a mortgage uh so
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
this is and that would go for
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
refinancing as well and I know that uh
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
they and others other uh federal
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
agencies and also banks are looking at
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh opportunities to leverage this
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
because of the need because of the
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity that people have one of the
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
difficulties right now is the relatively
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates uh we're
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing now in comparison to the
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
past couple years just bear in mind
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
interest rates right now historically
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
speaking are pretty good they're just
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
not 3% U which is what we had come uh
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
we' become accustomed
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
to um regarding the issue of parking uh
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
in rep interview Kelly you you asked
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
this question about one space per Adu
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I want to direct you to to um the
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
the bill language which talks about uh
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is the bill as introduced uh page
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
three page two line 20 an additional
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
parking space for each accessory
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
bedroom that's the existing language in
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
in the the bill so it is it flexes based
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
upon the number of bedrooms per
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit so I think this
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
this issue of parking representative
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
Wally who said do we do we have a
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
parking problem is a red herring frankly
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
raised by a lot of
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
communities um if you look at single
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
family homes and how municipalities deal
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
with permitting of single family homes
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much hands-off other than
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
the building permit is it allowed by
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
zoning if yes then you pull the building
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
permit you build the
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
house accessory dwelling units are
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be an extension of a single
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
family home thus the word EX accessory
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's accessory to a single family home
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
so those communities that are uh you
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
know saying yes we want single family
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
homes and I think that is probably 234
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
out of 234 Incorporated municipalities
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
State uh are not for the most part
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
regulating parking of those so why is it
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
that suddenly with accessory dwelling
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
units we're going to see a flood of cars
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen unless you have
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
a family that has cars and I look at
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
single family homes in my town without
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling un it's small homes
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
modest homes might have five or six cars
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
all registered all legal uh just parked
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the yard if this is a concern it's
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
not about the accessory dwelling
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
unit and if it is a concern in a
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipality then regulate how you do it
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
with single family family
 
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.189 align:start position:0%
with single family family
homes

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
um regarding um representative D Lorenzo
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
you had asked about the difference
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
between an accessory dwelling unit and
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
an in-law apartment there is no
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
difference there is absolutely no
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
difference we used to call them in-law
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
apartments or mother-in-law apartments
 
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that Granny Flats uh I
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
think that's an Australian term um and
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh that essentially has gone by the
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
Wayside because the current accessory
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit law uh prohibits
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities from from requiring a
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
familial relationship between the
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
occupants of the primary dwelling unit
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the accessory unit uh so they there
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
does not have to be a family
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
relationship between them so we used to
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
call it that we don't need to
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
anymore um representative y Kelly you
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
asked about the the prospect of a long
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
breezeway well I got that question from
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
the planner some a few years ago in Wolf
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
bro who who called me and said well we
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
have has to be attached under the
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
current law uh so he asked me well I get
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
this guy who's proposing a 300 foot
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
Breezeway these these
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
ridiculous attempts to
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
overcome an unnecessary regulatory
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
barrier are the result of that
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary regulatory barrier which is
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
limiting uh what is allowed to attached
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
accessory dwell units house built 1291
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
by allowing detached accessory dwelling
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
units eliminates that that uh illogical
 
01:20:36.639 --> 01:20:38.830 align:start position:0%
units eliminates that that uh illogical
absurd

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
absurd
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
result um representative Gibbs is not
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
here but um I'll I'll talk with her uh
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
separately but I do want to point out uh
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
the the state's 811 program uh it New
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing is the entity that is
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
able to apply to the federal government
 
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
for funding through the 811 program
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
we're using that in response to the
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
state's 2014 settlement uh which dealt
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
with people with serious mental illness
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
in re Amanda d uh and we we use that in
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the Department of
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
Health and unit services to provide
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
housing uh new housing or or units in
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
existing housing for people with serious
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
me mental illness so that that is an
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
active program and we've just applied
 
01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
for uh new funding in the current
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
round um I think I've said enough and
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'll stop here happy to take any
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
questions any questions represent mcon
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um in back in the
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of your conversation thank you
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
for taking the question you talked about
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
a recent study that came up in the
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
Brookings Institute but I I missed what
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
that was in reference
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
to representative makoni that is in
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
reference to the cost of construction of
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units and whether it
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
makes economic sense for a homeowner to
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
do it and the conclusion was uh
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
generally yes it does make sense and I'd
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
be happy to supply a link to that to the
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
you representative D Lorenzo thank you
 
01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned section 811
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with 811 but I wasn't aware
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
that it could be scattered site units is
 
01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
that it could be scattered site units is
that

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
correct representative D Lorenzo it I
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
think it could be scattered site we use
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
it in in uh connection to our other
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
financing programs for multif family
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
housing construction so for example we
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
give points to developers in the
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
qualified allocation plan which is the
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit funding
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
program uh we give points to developers
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
who say they're going to dedicate
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh X number of units to people who uh
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
would be receiving 811 uh rental support
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you represent
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
yo thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
question um so you seem to
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh agree that the the bill as introduced
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
addresses uh appropriately the concerns
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
of one of my municipalities as far as
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
parking however the amendment
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposed um seeks to change that to uh
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
not might bring more concern and
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
heartbreak and and heartburn I guess for
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
for my municipality do you believe that
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
concern is it correct to believe that
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
that that you your uh testimony saying
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that concern is unfounded um and
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we should adopt the amendment or
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
that that that in the rare case that the
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
municipality does have that concern that
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
they should be able to to do it per
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
bedroom uh representative I support the
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
amendment um I I do believe that as I
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
said before it's it's a red herring it's
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
something that municipalities some
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities raise as a means of
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
saying well we we can't do that at all
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
because this uh remotely uh likely thing
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
might happen at some point in the future
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
we can't do any of it uh that seems to
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
me to um be the wrong approach if and I
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
I'll repeat this if a municipality
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
believes that it has a parking problem
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
associated with single family homes then
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
it should regulate that not stop
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit

represent Damon thank you thank you for
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
being here and helping us sort through
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
this you spoke early in your testimony
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
about municipalities that have put
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties in place with the existing

law does this version should it go
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
forward address all or most of those
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you for that question
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
it I think it addresses many of the
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerns and and representative Ella has
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
been asking is is this your is this your
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
top issue uh I I'd say the top two uh
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
issues that I see are the special
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
processes uh so conditional use permit
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
or special exception uh it's you know um
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh was said earlier that the these these
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
pose barriers uh to homeowners seeking
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
to do this with their these sorts of
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
things with their properties uh and
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes um it people just say no I'm
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna I don't want I don't want
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
to go before the zba uh it's it's too
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
daunting a
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
proposition um so I
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
think allowing at least one accessory
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit by right is essential to
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
allowing these things to happen uh also
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
allowing that to be a detached accessory
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit so i' say those are my two
 
01:26:28.159 --> 01:26:32.149 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit so i' say those are my two
top

01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
ones thank you very much for your
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
Taylor good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Nick Taylor
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
workforce Housing Coalition of the
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
greater Sea Coast we're a nonprofit that
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
works in straford and Rockingham County
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
seeking to advance diverse housing
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
options attainable to our Workforce
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for all the time you spent on
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
this bill both today and and I know over
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
the past few months um we're here in
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
strong support of House Bill
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
1291 accessory drilling units broadly
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
and then this bill specifically provide
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
incredible benefits uh to the housing
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
market and I'll run through a couple
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
points here on affordability as has been
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know we certainly have an
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
affordability challenge in our state and
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is an option that is more
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
attainable to our Workforce without
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
additional subsidies so it allows it to
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
come forward as needed on the
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
construction affordability point in
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
addition to what Mr Frost said we have
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
talked with Community Banks in our
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
region who are interested in putting
 
01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
together Adu specific lending programs
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
that help make it more financially
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
feasible to construct them their
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions are how do we mitigate the
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
risk from a public hearing process where
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
something could be denied after someone
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
has put thousands of dollars in
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
permitting fees through our architecture
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
and engineering fees as well as what is
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
the demand and so I think we can see
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a demand and by mitigating
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
the risks it'll make it more likely that
 
01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
folks of all income levels and not just
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
those that can afford to front some
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
money uh will be able to afford to build
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional accessory dwelling units um
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
in addition as has been mentioned this
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
is a pro property rights you know issue
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
and that allowing folks to construct
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
additional accessory dwelling units
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
allows them to make a decision with
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
their property that bests fits the fits
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
the need of their family that may be a
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
home for an aging parent it may be a a
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
child returning from from college or
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
back to the home or it may be just for
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
additional income stream for them to be
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
able to stay in their home and stay in
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
their Community finally you know this
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
kind of question of how will it affect
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
the community and what is the demand
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
will this actually get built as has been
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know this is a great
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
gentle density it's a great infill
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
option that really doesn't change the
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
feel of any sort of community or
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood while adding add additional
 
01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
housing Supply the center for uh the
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
stam College Center for ethics and
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
society and their annual housing survey
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
asked the question of have you
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
considered building an accessory
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit 10% of folks said they
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
already did 35% said they had considered
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
it but ran into regulatory or financial
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
barriers and that is what stopped them
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
from moving things forward so again
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a demand and there's
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
almost a little over 400,000 single
 
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
family homes so even if just 10% of
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
those folks who are interested built an
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
Adu that would be another
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
40,000 uh housing units for this state
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
that is desperately needed so this bill
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
will make an impact we think there's a
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
lot of great pieces in here it's great
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
for our businesses great for our economy
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
and will increase choices amongst
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
renters and homeowners so we hope your
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
support and happy to take any questions
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony represent
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
viella hi thank you um it was said
 
01:29:51.159 --> 01:29:52.430 align:start position:0%
viella hi thank you um it was said
earlier

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
that um municip we're not seeing a flood
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
of adus um come in and there was hinted
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
that there's um some
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
barriers um for a devil's advocate um
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
approach the the nhas is in their
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
testimony is saying that that uh
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
Durham uh has one in
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
nine uh single family h houses in Durham
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
have an Adu I guess the question is
 
01:30:31.109 --> 01:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
isn't that already saturation and um in
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
that municipality and if we made it
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
super easy is are we looking at like a
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
one and two like a very very just like
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
every single house in in New hampsh in
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
Durham is is uh has an Adu and there is
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
no place in Durham that is you know
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
single family home anymore I think
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
realistically we need to and thank you
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the question increase a whole bunch
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
of housing options and you know living
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
in sort of the reality of needing the
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
private property owner to decide that
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
this is the right thing to do you know
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
you I don't think you'll be in a
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
situation where every home has an
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit on it and the
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
sort of Patchwork of local restrictions
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
has I think lowered the the interest or
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
or at least put up some barriers for
 
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
other communities and other individuals
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
who want to explore this option but just
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
run into hurdles and don't have the time
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
to look through or go through a public
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
that represent D Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
chair and good great to see you Nick and
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
here's my question um you mentioned a
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
poll a research poll asking folks if
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
they were interested in adding an Adu
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
which poll is that yes thank you for the
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
question it's from the St ansam College
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
Center for ethics housing uh voter
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
attitudes on housing affordability
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
survey from 2023 oh great thank you is
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that a St anom College poll like the
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
way they do typical polls or is was that
 
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.629 align:start position:0%
way they do typical polls or is was that
like

01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
a like it was a scientific poll it was a
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
scientific because I know sometimes they
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
just like put something out and to fill
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%

to testify on behalf of 603 Ford in
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1291 which would
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
ow a second accessory dwelling unit or
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
Adu by right and reduce restriction on
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions on adus and just to start
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
with a personal story I live in a home
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
with an Adu my partner's family lives
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
with us and without our Adu and him we
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
we just wouldn't be able to afford our
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
home and he would have a very hard time
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh foring a place on his own and also I
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
would not have him to watch my dog when
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
I come down to uh to speak with all of
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
you which I'm sure we all are grateful
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
for um but you know it's no secret that
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
with the growing deficit in housing in
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it affects us all
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners renters business owners um
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
but particularly the situation is
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
placing a heavy burden on young folks in
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
our Workforce as you've heard today and
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
in my job I meet with young people in
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all the time who share
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
their stories of struggle trying to find
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
safe affordable housing um and folks
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
like Michael who gave me a story that I
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
could share today uh he said quote it's
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
a real struggle to afford housing these
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
days especially when all the prices are
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
geared toward households with two or
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
more incomes it leaves people like me
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
stranded with no option other than
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
living in a car in a Walmart parking lot
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
or at a highway rest stop which is what
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
I've resorted to doing since leaving my
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
apartment it's not how a hard person
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
hard working person should be forced to
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
live and um as you've also heard
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units already are
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
playing a really crucial role in
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
addressing the housing needs in New
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by providing smaller uh more
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
naturally affordable housing options and
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
research does show that in many states
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units continue to uh
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
rent for less than market rate rentals
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so in conclusion by allowing
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners to build either an attached
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
or detached Adu on their property in
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
removing burdensome regulations we can
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
diversify our housing Supply with more
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options tailored to
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
individuals at uh different stages of
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
life um with a more and with a more
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
diverse array of housing choices people
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
will have the opportunity to find and
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
afford a home that suits their specific
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
needs um so I hope you will support this
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill hb1 1291 makes small changes to
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
existing laws to remove barriers uh that
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
currently make it difficult for
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners to build these units and uh
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
we hope that you'll be part of a
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
solution to address New Hampshire's
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
housing crisis thank
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
question you said that you have an uh
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
Adu currently um have you sought out um
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have a second Adu as
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
this this bill might allow and were
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
denied or or would you put in a Adu a
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
second Adu in your uh situation if you
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
you had the
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh I mean certainly look
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
into it we haven't currently um you know
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
our needs are pretty well met but if it
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
was a possibility I don't see why we
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't look into it if uh if the
 
01:35:56.679 --> 01:35:59.950 align:start position:0%
wouldn't look into it if uh if the
opportunity

01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
shortage in New Hampshire um we need

20,000 units in the next few years just
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
to keep up with demand um and unless
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're using all our resources to the
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
best of our ability we'll never meet
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
that goal there are a lot of young
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire who want to stay
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
here uh but if there's no housing for
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
them they'll be forced to leave uh this
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%

Dober uh where I live both because of
 
01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
the prices and also because there just
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
weren't units available I myself am
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
staying in a less than ideal apartment
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
because my roommates and I don't have
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
another place to move to and um this
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
crisis is affecting young people who are
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
getting out of school and want to stay
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
here uh and families who are looking to
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
buy homes for the first time and put
 
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
buy homes for the first time and put
down

01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
Roots um accessory dwelling units
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity to young people
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire um on a
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
previous hearing day a number of
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
students and people in their early 20s
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
came to speak in favor of adus many of
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
them couldn't be here today so they
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony instead in
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
those testimonies you'll hear similar
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
arguments you've heard today they are
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
struggling to find housing considering
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
leaving the state because of it and that
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
removing burdensome regulations on adus
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
is an important creative way for us to
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
increase housing Supply and address New
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is just thanks to the

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
worked really hard and put in long hours
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
um to come up with possible bipartisan
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
solutions to address the housing crisis
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
like hb1 1291 that's not easy not every
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
committee is able to do that and at the
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
end of the day making sure people
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
families can have a place to live in New
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%

for myself like the typical
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
person because of this my welfare is is
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
heavily dependent upon both the state
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and federal governments this leaves me
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
seriously limited when it comes to
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
housing especially here in New
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've personally struggled with
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
housing for the last 5
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
years we also live in a time where the
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
reality is that a lot of adult children
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
are living with or renting from their
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
parents because rents are so high they
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to live on their own I can
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
no longer afford to live in Dover I
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
certainly can't afford to live in
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmith or Greenland and I can barely
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
afford to live in Rochester now so I'm
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
not sure where I'm going to go as rents
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
continue to go
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
up um please also consider that the lack
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
of housing options means that sometimes
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
renters are forced to stay with
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
landlords who may not have the most
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
ideal practices
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe even abusive practices because
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
where are they to go so it really takes
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
power away from the renter and the
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
person in that position of renting what
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
am I supposed to do when my
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
landlord doesn't doesn't meet my basic
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
needs because it's a process to have
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
that addressed in a legal way and the up
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
the other alternative is to find
 
01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.950 align:start position:0%
the other alternative is to find
additional

01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
housing I'd also like to put forward
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
that right now now I'm living my highest
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
quality of life because I was able to
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
find an Adu to rent that Adu has
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
provided me with rent control it has
 
01:40:35.709 --> 01:40:35.719 align:start position:0%
provided me with access to people
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
because I have special needs that are
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
not typical I have people on site if I
 
01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:42.350 align:start position:0%
not typical I have people on site if I
need

01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.070 align:start position:0%
need
them

01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so in short I'm in favor of hb1 1291
 
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
because it creat creates affordable
 
01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
alternative housing options for all New
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and it puts some
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
power and control back into
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
renters uh thank you board for your time
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%

Carpenter I'm a resident of Manchester
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the town that I call home
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
and where I grew up today I become I
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
come before you as an educated young
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
professional working two different jobs
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
yet still finding it impossible to
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
afford board housing in the community
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
that I grew up in and with that I'm here
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
today to testify in support of House
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1291 relative to accessory dwelling
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
units and my reason is pretty much
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward um I support any
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that will decrease barriers
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
to smart and sustainable development and
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
increase housing options for folks like
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
myself who have been stifled by the lack
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
of affordable and available housing in
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
our state and this is exactly what this
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
bill intends to do
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
as someone looking to find a place of my
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
own in New Hampshire I've paid close
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
attention to the efforts underway on the
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
state and local level to make this
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
possible for people like myself and more
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
than anything it's been incredibly
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
disheartening to see how contentious
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
something as essential as housing has
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
become in political dialogues housing
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
and shelter is not a choice it's a
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
necessity and there are things that we
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
can do to increase its accessibility in
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
the state this being one of those
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
things it's no secret that New Hampshire
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
has some of the most restrictive
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers in the country and
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will go a long way to
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
alleviate the impact of these
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
long-standing barriers on housing access
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the state and I know I speak for many
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
young folks when I say as much as I'd
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
love to live in the community I grew up
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
in live near my family and be a resource
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
to my aging parents no roof overhead is
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
where sacrificing all um access to
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
groceries medication uh Financial
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
Security to obtain it we need affordable
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
and attainable housing and we need it
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
now if the state has a chance at
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
retaining the next generation of workers
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem solvers and change makers like
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
yourself in in conclusion House Bill
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
1291 offers a practical and sustainable
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
solution to the housing crisis in New
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and by endorsing this
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we are not just addressing
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
the current challenges but also laying a
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
groundwork for a more secure and vibrant
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
future for all people that call this

for housing uh the ones we have
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
considered for our son are purchasing a
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
home for him and having a enhanced
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%

situation uh the the challenge with
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
something like a home uh for our son
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
with an enhanced family care provider is
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
that it's can be brittle and what'll
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
happen is if the if the care provider is
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
no longer present we now have our son
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
who does not he cannot live
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
independently okay so we have what's the
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
five minutes going to bring what the two
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
hours going to bring what's the day
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
what's the week what's the month going
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
to bring what's the long-term solution
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
and so what happens and we've seen this
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
with families that I know uh this has
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
happened to them they've purchased a
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
home for their
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
son the care provider is no longer
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
present the son has to now move back and
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
go through a disruptive change okay so
 
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
that was not a viable choice for us an
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
Adu however provides us the ability to
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
have some resiliency in this uh system
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
if if the care provider is no longer
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
present we're right next door we can
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
help provide the care we can provide the
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
continuity of care we can be resilient
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
and and and provide our son with the
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
ability to handle this change until we
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
can and until we can find a new enhanced
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
family care provider
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the the 750 s feet minimum uh that we
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
have right now or sorry
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
maximum I I always struggle with how to
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
phrase that but that 750 square feet
 
01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
number is a big challenge because it
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
really supports what we would call an
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
in-law apartment where there's a couple
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh living
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
in a single bedroom in a place in a
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
situation with my son what we would have
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
is a need for two bedrooms okay because
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
people need privacy they need personal
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
space 750 square feet does not allow
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
that a th000 square feet would okay so
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
this would provide my my wife and I the
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
ability to at our own expense to build
 
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
an Adu to provide a a long-term housing
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
solution for our son um and I I guess
 
01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
what I'd also potentially add is it's
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
funny that the 750
 
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
number it it seems to imply an addition
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh of square footage to the house right
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
if you have somebody with a large house
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
who's now an empty nester um maybe
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility to divide that
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
house use existing rooms to build an Adu
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
out of that and so why do you want to
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
constrict that to 750 fet as well all
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
right if I don't I don't know if you
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm I'm saying here but
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm trying to say so
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh please uh help me help my wife
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh find a long-term solution for my son
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
by supporting hb1

bill do you have the amendment

ask hey Ben
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
do we have cop do we have an amendment
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
number for Scott for the um his bill is
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
right hope I was hoping that you would
 
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
consider that as a possible Amendment to
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
the sprinkler bill as
 
02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
well the one that has amendment to HB
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
blank yeah I that you just passed it
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay it has to do with the um local
 
02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
okay it has to do with the um local
building

02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
well um I I'm going to start with 1361
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
because representative Wallace is
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
getting his things together um and I
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so let's get started with
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
1361 um I have a lot of amendments
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
too so
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
1361 I have passed around an amendment
 
02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:50.109 align:start position:0%
1361 I have passed around an amendment
number

02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
1035 and I apologized to the committee I
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
hadn't sent it to you earlier it
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
literally was drafted 30 minutes ago so
 
02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
um I emailed them on Monday and they
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
just got got it to me today so
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
um this I believe so so to start during
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I think the committee
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
indicated that they wanted to um from
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
what I understand correct me if I'm
 
02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
wrong lay the hammer down more on
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing um
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
I would personally support that but I
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
think what's better as a committee is
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we rewrite the statute make it more
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
clear which is what this amendment does
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
um and then we present it to the house
 
02:05:32.549 --> 02:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
and we help educate members on what
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is because I think
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
that this is a long-term solution to the
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is start with
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing um so this
 
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the bill except for
 
02:05:46.990 --> 02:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date I believe and um just
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
clarifies some language that were issues
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing so I hope that
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
you'll at least consider this
 
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.229 align:start position:0%
you'll at least consider this
representative

02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you uh C do you mind because
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
I just got back from the restroom can
 
02:06:02.669 --> 02:06:02.679 align:start position:0%
you walk us through the different pieces
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that replaces the bill
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
the so this kind of breaks it up so
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was floating
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
around during the public hearing which
 
02:06:16.159 --> 02:06:17.589 align:start position:0%
around during the public hearing which
was

02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:19.719 align:start position:0%
0114 which
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
was almost the same um I also have Ben
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
here that's able to explain the
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
differences between the two but it
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
basically rewrites the current statute
 
02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.790 align:start position:0%
basically rewrites the current statute
and

02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
um allow basically says that
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities cannot regulate
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing exclude it
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
completely from the municipality it has
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
to provide reasonable zoning in
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic opportunities
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
for it um but Ben do you mind walking us
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Ben Frost from New
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh we're
 
02:07:03.650 --> 02:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
addressing uh 135h or
 
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:06.830 align:start position:0%
addressing uh 135h or
[Music]

02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
135h uh you as the chairman noted you
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
had seen uh another amendment uh before
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
114h and there was some questions about
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
Clarity and so this attempts to address
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
that um what this does is it takes the
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
existing statute uh and parses it out in
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
a way that is uh readable and logical uh
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
it there's some ambiguity in the the
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
structure of the current law but what is
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
proposed here in this amendment uh
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies that and says these are the
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
obligations of the minicipal
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
relative to manufactured housing so um
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
what you see on lines um particularly
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 19 is really where the
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
parsing occurs so this is what
 
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are currently supposed to
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
do and it just puts it in a format
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's easier to read uh they must allow
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing on individual Lots
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
or in manufactured housing parks and in
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh manufactured housing
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
parks are places where the the unit
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
owner the the occupant owns the unit but
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
not the land underlying it a
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing uh subdivision is
 
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
where the unit owner also owns the land
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
under it so it's like a it's like a
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision but just especially designed
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
for manufactured housing Parks or
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and I know that uh
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
Rochester in particular does have a
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
provision in its zoning ordinance that
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
deals with manufactured housing
 
02:08:57.069 --> 02:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um so they they're treating
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
that properly um lastly you can a
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
municipality can allow all three if it
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
wants to but it's obligation is under
 
02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:09.639 align:start position:0%
one and two betweens line between lines
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
11 and
 
02:09:12.199 --> 02:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
11 and
18

02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
18
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
um the clarification here and this gets
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
to representative K's question on the
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
day of the hearing whenever that was
 
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
last month uh in lines 5 through 8 uh
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
law says manufactur municipalities shall
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
afford reasonable and realistic
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the sighting of
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and manufactured
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
housing parks and
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and that confuses what
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
follows uh the the the the obligation
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
language and so what you see here in the
 
02:09:51.639 --> 02:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
language and so what you see here in the
amendment

02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
135h lines 5 through 8 uh clarifies that
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
by simply referring to what follows B in
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
and eliminates that confusing language
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the substance of the
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
law it just makes it clear what makes it
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
easier to
 
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.910 align:start position:0%
easier to
read

02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
um following down lines 20 through 26 uh
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
is essentially that what's in existing
 
02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
is essentially that what's in existing
statutes

02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
um what's different than uh actually
 
02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
um what's different than uh actually
[Music]

02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
through through 30 is existing statute
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh new is section is so paragraph e
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
starting in line 31 and extending over
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
to the following page uh through line
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
two so that's new language but is
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
essentially an existing obligation of
 
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to allow for expansion of
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
of existing parks
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.549 --> 02:10:54.559 align:start position:0%
language do you mind answering some
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Reed and I'll
 
02:10:59.709 --> 02:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
I'll note that uh Sarah marant is also
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
here she's the chief of staff from the
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
Community Loan
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
Fund represent readed go ahead thank you
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question um
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
my memory and I was actually trying to
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
find the bill in my folder and I can't
 
02:11:16.589 --> 02:11:16.599 align:start position:0%
seem to um is that the original Bill
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
sought to allow manufactured homes
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
wherever um stick builts were allowed is
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
that is that correct and I understand
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
the the language cleanup but as I read
 
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
um this amendment it's a lot less uh I
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
guess aggressive and the idea is that as
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
long as a municipality allows
 
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks and
 
02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.350 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks and
manufactur

02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
manufactur
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
housing uh all right I guess I'm I'm
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what a town would
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
have to allow and would they still have
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
to allow it on private Lots where stick
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
builts are um if they allow for parks in
 
02:11:58.520 --> 02:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
builts are um if they allow for parks in
their

02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
town okay so a couple of questions there
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
um uh regarding the first I think the
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
introduced is really just it's a bit
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
confusing uh and it proposed to
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
the L part of the language related to
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh the manufactured housing
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and I think that that
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
actually added confusion to uh to the
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
law and it also rearranged some of the
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
languages but I don't think that it
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
imposed that kind of obligation that
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting representative Reed
 
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
that that they must be allowed um
 
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
wherever stick Built Homes are allowed
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh and stick built or modular I mean
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
single family homes as opposed to
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing um so I I don't
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
think that the bill has introduced
 
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
changed that
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
standard the the amendment and I'm
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
referring again to
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
1035 uh essentially mirrors the existing
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
law and repeats the the obligation so
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
again municipalities must allow
 
02:13:13.079 --> 02:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
again municipalities must allow
manufactured

02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
housing on individual Lots where single
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
family homes are allowed
 
02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
or allow them in parks and subdivisions
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's the obligation they can allow
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
them in all three situations if they
 
02:13:28.510 --> 02:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
want to uh but they have to do on
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
individual Lots or in parks and
 
02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
individual Lots or in parks and
subdivisions

02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:45.559 align:start position:0%
question so I'm trying to compare the
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
original Bill the other Amendment and
 
02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:49.390 align:start position:0%
original Bill the other Amendment and
this

02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently and I think overall my
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
question is it sounds like almost all of
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
what's in this newest amendment is
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
already existing law and if I'm correct
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
about that what are we accomplishing
 
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.910 align:start position:0%
about that what are we accomplishing
with

02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
this that's a great question um I I
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
wherever you as legislators can impart
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the law you're making
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
people's lives better and I think this
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
does that uh it I will I will confess
 
02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:24.549 align:start position:0%
does that uh it I will I will confess
I've

02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
I've
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
been practicing Municipal law uh well
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
this is this will be my 30th Anniversary
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
um in new hampsh and I've been a planner
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
for 40 years um for at least a couple
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
decades I was misreading the existing
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
law and and it was only until I really
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
sat down with it
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
and oh okay different Bill uh I really
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
sat down with it and and studied it and
 
02:14:57.390 --> 02:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
thought about it that I realized I had I
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
I had seen these these things as
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
three exclusive options individual plots
 
02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
Parks subdivisions but it's that parks
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions that I'd been
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
misreading and I recognize now if if if
 
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
I'd really taken the time to to think
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
through it I would have seen that so I
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
figured well if if I'm confused about it
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
probably other people are confused about
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
it too and so this does seek to clarify
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
that um I will point out representative
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
Damon that uh e starting on lines 30 31
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
of page one uh is new language the rest
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
of it is pretty much the existing law uh
 
02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.390 align:start position:0%
of it is pretty much the existing law uh
it

02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:41.669 align:start position:0%
it
does

02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:45.559 align:start position:0%
um the existing law in in one place said
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
um reasonable opportunities and another
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
another place said realistic
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities and in both places it now
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
says reasonable and realistic so that's
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
a slight language shifting but with no
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
think thank you that's helpful and I
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
certainly do agree that the formatting
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
is easier to follow and be clear
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
about however I'm concerned that I
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
believe our original intent with this
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
yes I shouldn't be speaking for
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander but I'm going
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
to um was
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
to promote more opportunity for
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing to be
 
02:16:33.309 --> 02:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
utilized and I'm I guess I would be
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
asking do you think this in some way
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
does that yes it does e uh starting on
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
line 31 page one does achieve
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
that and I I would also say that
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
um many of our colleagues in my opinion
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
are not as educated on what manufactured
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
housing looks like and I hope you'd
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
agree with me on that um and I think
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about solutions
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the housing crisis we need to first
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
start from a point of maybe not
 
02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
everybody knows everything and I think
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
if we rewrite the statute to make it
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
clear as a committee we're helping to
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
educate not only the public but our
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues on um the importance of this
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
this piece of the puzzle um so I would
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
say like yes in the in the ideal world I
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
would love an amendment that would just
 
02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
like build up manufactured housing
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere right like but I think when
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
we start here I'm an incrementalist and
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
when we start here and rewrite it and
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
make it clear then we can go on maybe
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
next year when there's maybe a rule
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
change and there's an actual committee
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
on housing we can kind of work work
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
towards this goal and move in the right
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
direction this moves it in the right
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
direction in my opinion representative
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question again and I am in
 
02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
agreement with everything that's been
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
said I would love to just see a bill
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's like manufactured housing is
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
allowed wherever you have a lot um my
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
question is so I and I I hate to like
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
dig down like this so this says that a a
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
municipality must provide it
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
in on individual Lots in most but not
 
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily all land areas in districts
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
zone for uh residential use use or the
 
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
housing parks and subdivisions and I
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification that you're
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
bringing to to this because I understand
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
what you what you had always interpreted
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
was they can allow either Lots or Parks
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
or subdivisions and what you're saying
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
no you have to do lots or parks and
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
subdivisions however when we say in most
 
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily all land areas
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be by acreage am I right
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
not by number number of lots in the town
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
and um still being incrementalist and
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
not doing the yeah you just are going to
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
have to allow manufacturing houses could
 
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
we not say in most of the Lots in the
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
town instead of most of because I could
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
foresee especially towns that have 20
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
acre lot minimums them just saying oh
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's a few lots that we're going to
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
allow a manufactured house on but the
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
vast majority of lots still would not
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
allow it and I'm wondering if that would
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
be something that would be feasible to
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
do here thank you for that question I I
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
think and bear in mind this is existing
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
law and it's been law since the early
 
02:19:31.150 --> 02:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
80s uh that language is in the current
 
02:19:33.309 --> 02:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
law and so municipalities have been
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with it for uh several
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
decades um I I think the the term land
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
areas uh refers to exactly that acreage
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
not number of lots if the legislature
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
had intended number of lots it would
 
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
have said number of lots it said instead
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
area and that's that is acreage or
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
whatever unit of aerial measurement you
 
02:19:59.790 --> 02:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
want to use um
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
so most but not necessarily all uh call
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
it a term of art if you if you want but
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's certainly something more
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
than than a
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
majority uh
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's it it's more than 51% uh most is is
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
something substantially larger than that
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
what the exact number is I don't know uh
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it has never been litigated and it's
 
02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
never been raised really as an issue um
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
it is the existing law if if you wanted
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
to put some flesh on those bones I think
 
02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's that might be helpful but uh just
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that this this has been the
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
law for U you know 40
 
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
years represent mononi thank you Mr
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you uh for for the
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
amendment here
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
um I sincerely appreciate what you're
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do here I am one that has
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
great familiarity with what we're
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
talking about here uh and I especially
 
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
like that you listen to the committee
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
and added e in the bottom there and I I
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that's a great step forward and um
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm in the support of what they've
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
brought forward here thank you thank you
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
represent Vell
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think I have
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
to uh agree with representative Damon
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
that I feel like I'm Shuffling the
 
02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
chairs on the Titanic kind of a thing um
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
and not actually move like
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
moving us in a substantially New
 
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
Direction that this is just a rewrite
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
and and so what is what is the um you
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
know other than Clarity like the the
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
this I feel like I would like to do more
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
than that um and
 
02:22:02.479 --> 02:22:04.309 align:start position:0%
than that um and
one

02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
way that I ask that the that this
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee consider that is
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
um the consideration of
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe some some meat on the bones
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
are reasonable and realistic and and
 
02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
specifying that there shall be um you
 
02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
specifying that there shall be um you
know

02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:31.790 align:start position:0%
know
some

02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
part some undeveloped Lots in the zone
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
or in this uh what did we call it land
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
areas uh that that is most of the Town
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
it needs to actually have some under de
 
02:22:49.950 --> 02:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
developed lots that
 
02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:52.230 align:start position:0%
developed lots that
could

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate these uh additional units
 
02:22:58.240 --> 02:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate these uh additional units
um

02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
obviously any lot couldn't be de be uh
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know leveled and then started over
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
but that's not really getting to the
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
point of this committee which is more
 
02:23:11.479 --> 02:23:13.389 align:start position:0%
point of this committee which is more
housing

02:23:13.389 --> 02:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and so I I just kind of throw that
 
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
out there as as possibly some meat on
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
the bones of like saying like hey you
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
actually it's great that you you know uh
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
designated your swamp as being able to
 
02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.190 align:start position:0%
designated your swamp as being able to
uh

02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
allow uh manufactured housing but
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's no Lots on it that are
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
developable I I understand where you're
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
coming from and I think maybe one of my
 
02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
proposals is that we start here as a
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
bare minimum and we approve this and
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
then maybe committee members are allowed
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
to to put in a floor Amendment and if
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
that passes but I don't want to not do
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
anything so if we rewrite and then if
 
02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
you want to put more meat in the bones
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
like go ahead and introduce some sort of
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to add that um but at least
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're moving this in I believe the right
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
direction that's that's my proposal to
 
02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
you go ahead representative Reed thank
 
02:24:10.349 --> 02:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair also I am also in agreement
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
with representative Damon and yella that
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
I would also like to see a little bit
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
more forward movement I appreciate that
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
here's uh suggestion that that might
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
come in the form of a floor Amendment
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps getting to both what I said in
 
02:24:25.269 --> 02:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
terms of number of lots and what
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative yella said we could add
 
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
on line 11 in individual on individual
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
Lots in most but not necessarily all
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
land areas and in no case um less than
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
75% of undeveloped Lots in the
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
municipality or something like that um
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
my question is I thought from our he or
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
the first the hearing that we had said
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
down on line 31 uh e that we needed to
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
add not just the expansion of
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks but also the
 
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
building of new did did in the rewriting
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
of that did we forget that part or did
 
02:25:07.269 --> 02:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
we determine that expansion included the
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
new is that addressed to me thank you Mr
 
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
chairman okay um it was
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
um not inadvertent it was a a conscious
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
Choice uh to limit the scope of the bill
 
02:25:31.630 --> 02:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
point go ahead represent
 
02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:36.590 align:start position:0%
point go ahead represent
demon

02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
demon
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so one I I do respect the value of
 
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
incremental process in getting something
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
accomplished is far better than
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
nothing and and patience is not my
 
02:25:48.279 --> 02:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
nothing and and patience is not my
middle

02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
middle
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
name um we sh non mdle
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
name so maybe there'll be an amendment
 
02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:58.349 align:start position:0%
name so maybe there'll be an amendment
forthcoming

02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
that includes creating uh manufactured
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
housing parts that's just a statement
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out and and Mr
 
02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
Frost this is a question for you or
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else who can help
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
me what
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
distinguishes line five five to
 
02:26:20.670 --> 02:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
six municipalities shall afford
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic opportunities
 
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
you don't need me to read it all what
 
02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
distinguishes that from line
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
31 municipalities shall allow realistic
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities I mean it's that we're
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
talking about expansion that is that the
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
substance of it fif I'm sorry line five
 
02:26:45.269 --> 02:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
I'm on page one versus line 31 they
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
sound really not very different to
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
me admittedly yes the the words are the
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
same uh but the context is
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
different uh so in line five the context
 
02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
is global that is whether you're doing
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
it on individual Lots or in parks and
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that's not that's not the
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
concern it's just you shall globally in
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
your regulations allow a reasonable and
 
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
realistic opportunity for the sighting
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing however
 
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
configured on line 31 it's with specific
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
reference to manufactured housing Parks
 
02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
um I just want to note that in the
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
analysis and again correct me if I'm
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
Excuse me misinterpreting but I think
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's an error in the second
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
line when it says on individual lots and
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
in manufactured Parks because it seems
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
the language on page one is or not and
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that's really quite a different
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
meaning in that analysis and I confess I
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
do not prepare the
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
analyses so we should fix that represent
 
02:28:08.349 --> 02:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
VI I think uh yes thank you um I think
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
that the analysis is
 
02:28:12.359 --> 02:28:15.630 align:start position:0%
that the analysis is
actually

02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
correct the analysis is correct um and
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
that is because um it
 
02:28:25.319 --> 02:28:26.990 align:start position:0%
that is because um it
is

02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh e is
 
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.870 align:start position:0%
uh e is
not

02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.870 align:start position:0%
not
dependent

02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
on which you choose in A or B it e is
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
its own at the same level as a and so
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
you have to even if you chose on
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
individual if you chose individual lots
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
and you technically were not choosing
 
02:28:53.389 --> 02:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
that other one you also now have to
 
02:28:53.399 --> 02:28:54.510 align:start position:0%
that other one you also now have to
allow

02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:28:57.070 --> 02:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunities of expansion of
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
existing manufactured
 
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh manufactured housing Park so if
 
02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
you you know let's say at some time in
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
the past previously had a manufacturer
 
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
Park get approved let's say through a
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
zba process or something that was not
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
currently allowed or what whatnot y now
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
even though you chose option one now you
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to also allow the expansion of that
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
existing one even though you're not
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
doing option two right in in in B he's
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
right and Mr chairman if I may I think
 
02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're both right actually and I'll
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
point out point out why representative
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
Kelly you're right the second sentence
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
does refer to e the first sentence of
 
02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.389 align:start position:0%
does refer to e the first sentence of
the

02:29:43.389 --> 02:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
analysis uh perpetuates the the error of
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the two
 
02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
ands so it's uh the the
 
02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
obligation um is on individual Lots or
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
in manufactured housing parks and
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
obligation go ahead thank you are you
 
02:30:13.269 --> 02:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
trying to um because I think they're
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get at e and in that sentence
 
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
are are you implying that maybe we
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
should add in E that municipalities
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
should have a reasonable ex realistic
 
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
expectation uh opportunities for
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
expansion of housing parks
 
02:30:30.399 --> 02:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
expansion of housing parks
and

02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:34.670 align:start position:0%
and
uh

02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in which case it would be
 
02:30:41.550 --> 02:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
in line with two if if uh you had a
 
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
subdivision and you needed to expand the
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
subdivision then that would also be be
 
02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:48.389 align:start position:0%
subdivision then that would also be be
covered

02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
because they go together as a pair
 
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:52.510 align:start position:0%
because they go together as a pair
apparently

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
right I I was I wasn't meaning to imply
 
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
that but I think that's an interesting
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
idea the I I will point out and and I
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
think you've already articulated this
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
clearly representative your Cola e gets
 
02:31:07.630 --> 02:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
to those things that might be
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
non-conforming uh uses so someone
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
established a manufactured housing Park
 
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the adoption of zoning uh so
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's a legally existing non-conforming
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
use not generally subject to ex spatial
 
02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
expansion this allows for the spatial
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
expansion of those otherwise
 
02:31:28.399 --> 02:31:31.150 align:start position:0%
expansion of those otherwise
non-conforming

02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
uses prep coni do you have a question
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I want to caution on
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
putting numbers in here in most
 
02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.790 align:start position:0%
putting numbers in here in most
Lots

02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
um to two things there are people
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
sitting around this room that understand
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
how this will benefit and increase
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
housing stock there are towns and
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
individual property owners that will be
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
terrified of
 
02:32:07.150 --> 02:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
this small bites is much much better and
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
I just I I I've sat on zoning boards
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
I've chaired zoning boards I peer in
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
front of zoning boards all the time and
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of this ordinance is
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
Broad and trying to get boards to
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
understand what's here so I think
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's Merit in that um there is
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous Merit in manufactured parks
 
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:32.670 align:start position:0%
tremendous Merit in manufactured parks
in

02:32:32.670 --> 02:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
e um subdivisions is not not as big an
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue um and for the most part A
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision you know if you have a
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision and it has manufactured
 
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
homes in in it which I have done in the
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
past um it's not an issue it's it's
 
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
having enough land mass to go forward
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
what I do want to mention is there is so
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
there are very many properties in your
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
towns in towns that I serve that were
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
original subdivisions that already say
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
in it no manufactured homes no trailers
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
and now when you start adding up all of
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
those and then you apply a percentage
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to make it very difficult
 
02:33:21.389 --> 02:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
number one to come to what that number
 
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
is but also you may be forcing more
 
02:33:28.349 --> 02:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
units that you don't want so crawl on
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
this one it's it's and I'll save it for
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
executive session I I I think you have
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.429 --> 02:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you once
 
02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
again so just to recap what this bill is
 
02:33:48.429 --> 02:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
actually doing because I know that I had
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
some initial confusion as did I think
 
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
others I would just like to kind of
 
02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
paraphrase it so Roman numeral one we
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
have a through E A says globally you
 
02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
have to provide reasonable and realistic
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
which is the part we're adding uh
 
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for manufactured housing
 
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
in general b a town has to either allow
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
it on most of the acreage for individual
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
residential units or in parks
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions or all
 
02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:24.309 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions or all
three

02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
c um for the Lots you can't have any
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
additional restrictions that you don't
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
have on a regular
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
Home D if you chose the parks and and
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or the parks anyway um
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
realistic and reasonable opportunities
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
for their development and then e if you
 
02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.910 align:start position:0%
for their development and then e if you
have

02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
existing uh Parks you you have to allow
 
02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
for reasonable and realistic
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
expansion so this gives I I I guess
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's so Mr Frost thank you that was a
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
question I think yeah this I mean this
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
still allows municipalities a lot of
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
discretion on what they're going to do
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
but it just makes it clear that
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
something like they need to do something
 
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
in there so and there's a lot of options
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
here on the table so it's a menu It's A
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
nudge and I think a lot of us share the
 
02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
idea that um that we would like to do a
 
02:35:17.269 --> 02:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more than a nudge but I will
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
defer to the rest of the committee how
 
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
much more if any okay representative
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you I'm hoping to move on in
 
02:35:25.469 --> 02:35:25.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit too because we need we have
 
02:35:25.479 --> 02:35:26.349 align:start position:0%
a little bit too because we need we have
other

02:35:26.349 --> 02:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:35:26.359 --> 02:35:28.110 align:start position:0%
other
bills

02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
so perhaps there is some legal
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
definition that I'm unaware of of what
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
the meaning of reasonable is excuse me
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly looking at that on line
 
02:35:42.429 --> 02:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
30 although it's in here more than once
 
02:35:45.389 --> 02:35:45.399 align:start position:0%
what so what my then teenage daughters
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
thought was reason reasonable was not
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable understood um and I I have
 
02:35:56.590 --> 02:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
had a teenage daughter myself
 
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
um this is a term uh that again comes
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the existing Statute in one place
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
it said reasonable in another place it
 
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
said realistic we've merged them and
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
that the merger of those two to to read
 
02:36:14.349 --> 02:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic uh really is
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
straight out of the workforce housing
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh so the same
 
02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
language uh reasonable and realistic
 
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh occurs in the workforce
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
housing law uh it is ambiguous or not
 
02:36:31.269 --> 02:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear there as well and that
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
was done intentionally so to give
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the words of that
 
02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
statute maximum feasible
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility so uh consistent with
 
02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative M's admonition not to put
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
in numbers um give municipalities the
 
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility to figure out how to do it
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a way that suits them locally uh the
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
language here most of land areas is
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
pretty clear clear enough to give good
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
guidance to municipalities about what
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
do that's helpful it sounds like you're
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
saying that when you put reasonable and
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
realistic together that is stronger
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
alone I'm not sure that it's stronger um
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
but it it eliminates the need to ask
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between reasonable
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
and what's the difference between
 
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic where they
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
occurred in different places here it's a
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
single phrase mirroring the workforce
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
housing law so therefore might we not
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
want to do that in line 30 have it say
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
shall be reasonable and realistic as it
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
does in line five indeed yes you could
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
you so go ahead represent
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
Reed uh thank you once again um would it
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
not be true that adding on line 11 on
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
individual Lots in most but not
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily all land areas and in no
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
case in most Lots would also not
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
number

02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay so my question of the committee
 
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
is the committee
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable executing this this
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon or or are there members of the
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
committee that would like to work on
 
02:38:31.950 --> 02:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
language I and I think represent mconie
 
02:38:33.150 --> 02:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
I think there's a few of us that are
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable executing it um this
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon but if if I'll defer to the
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank thank you Ben I mean I
 
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
think that one simple thing if the
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
committee is is is amendable like the
 
02:38:50.370 --> 02:38:50.380 align:start position:0%
the language on
 
02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:52.230 align:start position:0%
the language on
[Music]

02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:38:57.550 --> 02:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
um of and lots throughout 9 through n
 
02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
where it says land areas just a say and
 
02:39:03.389 --> 02:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
lots and then on line 30 say and
 
02:39:06.269 --> 02:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
realistic as was just mentioned uh if we
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
could get that drafted before the the um
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
any this is like you know A Bridge Too
 
02:39:20.830 --> 02:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
Far maybe maybe it is with uh with some
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
members if if it is then I will not try
 
02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
and get one but I can repres makoni
 
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you if uh if as a separate
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it can be brought in before
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
i' be happy to consider it okay so I'm
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to task representative yella to
 
02:39:41.070 --> 02:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
run down to OS real
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
quick please okay so next I'm going to
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
call on represent ative Wallace to
 
02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
discuss um House Bill 1215 relative to
 
02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
discuss um House Bill 1215 relative to
subdivision

02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
regulations no it's a work session so
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
say okay uh thank you Mr chairman the
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh House Bill
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
1215 uh addresses a couple of items that
 
02:40:10.349 --> 02:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
were brought up by the uh uh code
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the uh fire inspector
 
02:40:14.590 --> 02:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
the in the legislative intent that we
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
had with this
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
um was such that once the subdivision is
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
approved those regulations and terms in
 
02:40:28.990 --> 02:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh pursuant to that particular
 
02:40:31.389 --> 02:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
subdivision remain in place and there
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
was some confusion on whether or not the
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
building codes would be frozen in time
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
so to speak at that same time that's not
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the intent this uh Amendment fixes that
 
02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
ambiguity to the extent that uh the
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes would be current
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh as of the date of issuance of the
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
building uh permit so for example
 
02:40:59.950 --> 02:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetically speaking the three of us
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
get together we develop a piece of
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
property we start construction and F we
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
get our approvals on the subdivision say
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
in 2024 those apply we start pulling out
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
building permits 5 years hence whatever
 
02:41:15.070 --> 02:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
building codes are in existence and fire
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
codes five years from now are the codes
 
02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
that would be applicable to the the
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
particular subdivision and then uh Ben
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
Frost also uh made a couple of tweaks to
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the to the 10 and
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
fiveyear uh pause on the uh the code
 
02:41:34.429 --> 02:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
changes so so that's what the amendment
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
does and that's very much in uh concert
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
with the original intent of this
 
02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and uh that's that's it
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
in essence thank you representative
 
02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
Wallace um I have a question for um Bill
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
mcken and um Fire Marshall tum me is
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
this language acceptable and address
 
02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:57.110 align:start position:0%
this language acceptable and address
your

02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
concerns feel free yeah come on up it's
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman Alexander members
 
02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
of the committee Bill McKinny with en
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the Amendments and yes it
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
addresses is our most significant
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
concerns is that the building in fire
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
codes would still move forward and we'd
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
be bu building to the most up-to-date
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
codes that we can I do have a question
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
of on number two and I think it's more
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
for clarification for my part um amend
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
34 I
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
believe and the language is is it the
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
building code Board of appeal shall hear
 
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and decide appeals of orders decisions
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
or determinations made by the building
 
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
official or Fire official relative to
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
the application and interpretation of
 
02:42:53.790 --> 02:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
local amendments to the state building
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
code is it the intent
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
to now bypass the local board of appeals
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
if one is in effect to and limit them to
 
02:43:08.910 --> 02:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
only the local amendments and then you'd
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
go you'd bypass and immediately go to
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
the building code review board for
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
appeals of anything involving the state
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:22.590 --> 02:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
Cod Ben would you like to answer that
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
since you were heavily involved in the
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
you I never thought I would have the
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit together with Phil
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
mckenny this it's a very special
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee wonderful
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
day um the the intent is to um as Mr
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
McKinny noted is to limit the
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
appeals uh that are heard by the local
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
building code board of appeals which is
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
usually in most communities the Zoning
 
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment uh by Statute if you
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a separate building code
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
board of appeals then it it is the
 
02:44:07.389 --> 02:44:07.399 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board of adjustment that serves
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
as the bcba and they they are a body
 
02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
that does not have experience in
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
building codes um
 
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
so the the objective here is to uh limit
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
their review to those situations where
 
02:44:25.469 --> 02:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
the municipality has made local
 
02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code or to
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
the fire code uh everything else uh
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
would go straight to the State Building
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
Code review
 
02:44:35.439 --> 02:44:37.469 align:start position:0%
Code review
board

02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay does that satisfy uh you folks it
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
does it helps to exp clarify that for me
 
02:44:46.110 --> 02:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's uh
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
um my one concern with that is you know
 
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
not knowing the exact number of appeals
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
around the state you know would we be
 
02:44:57.309 --> 02:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome to the um State build
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
and code review board with number of
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
appeals going immediately to them and
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
that possibly we we could look at um if
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
you're willing is you know maybe some
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
language in there and in the absence of
 
02:45:11.469 --> 02:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
a local building code board of appeals
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
then it immediately goes to the state
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
because I agree removing the Z Boards
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
out of the appeals process on building
 
02:45:24.269 --> 02:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
sense okay all right are there any other
 
02:45:32.429 --> 02:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
or okay thank you very much um Fire
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:47.070 align:start position:0%
 
add

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
add
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Sean to me you State Fire for
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
the record um I'm good with what they
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
said the only quick uh if we're clean
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
things up the state fire code is 155a
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
and the state uh State Building Code is
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
155a State Fire code would be3 that's
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
all just for clarity since we're making
 
02:46:07.349 --> 02:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
a few minor changes but I uh I'm good
 
02:46:11.550 --> 02:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
with the rest you on number two okay on
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
the second page um where it's
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
down that should be 153 A1 is the state
 
02:46:22.750 --> 02:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
fire code would be 153 uh 1531 is where
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
the definition of the state fire code
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
is and then the same thing would happen
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
three okay are we so let me ask the
 
02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
committee are we comfortable voting on
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
this bill this afternoon if
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace can get a couple
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
quick fixes done to this
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
bill I see NOS thank you very
 
02:46:48.750 --> 02:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
much it's a lot easier than I thought
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.830 --> 02:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
um HB 1065 I'm going to call on
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Damon um if you can chat
 
02:47:02.190 --> 02:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit about um possible
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
amendments that you have to your bill
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I also have an amendment myself that
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
entertain

02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
so from what I heard at the
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
um before you start from what I heard of
 
02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing is that um I believe
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's still merit to this bill because
 
02:47:40.389 --> 02:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
I think that the rule change that was
 
02:47:42.269 --> 02:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
happening in the Senate was just
 
02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
regarding existing structures and not
 
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
new structures being being built so I
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
think by and large this would cover new
 
02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
and existing is that correct
 
02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.110 align:start position:0%
and existing is that correct
representative

02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
Damon um you are correct about the
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um however this is also
 
02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
existing buildings it's not new
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
construction okay I mean it's not new
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
from the ground up construction it could
 
02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
be new in the sense of an old home being
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
reconfigured into four Apartments okay
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are two proposed amendments and I
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to run upstairs and get the second
 
02:48:22.030 --> 02:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
one because we just did it but you have
 
02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
just received Amendment
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
1034 um and this is the language that
 
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
was actually recommended by Mr Frost uh
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
in our prior discussion to essentially
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
make it clearer um it does not change
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the bill I do not
 
02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:42.349 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the bill I do not
believe

02:48:42.349 --> 02:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:48:45.389 --> 02:48:45.399 align:start position:0%
um it puts in the phrase
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
law to the
 
02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:50.510 align:start position:0%
law to the
contrary

02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and let me just refresh my memory
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
here nothing else is changed that's to
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
address potential conflicts in other
 
02:49:01.950 --> 02:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute correct okay which
 
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
is which is something that was a concern
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the Fire Marshall okay could be
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
concern okay um and the whoops the one
 
02:49:16.269 --> 02:49:16.279 align:start position:0%
that I will run up in get moment
 
02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.389 align:start position:0%
that I will run up in get moment
momentarily

02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
02:49:18.399 --> 02:49:22.389 align:start position:0%
momentarily
uh

02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.630 --> 02:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not the right one can you I'm
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
just gonna go get yeah we're gonna um be
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:50:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:43.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.640 --> 02:55:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
all right we are back um we're back
 
02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Damon can you please
 
02:55:40.110 --> 02:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
explain the other Amendment thank you Mr
 
02:55:43.510 --> 02:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
chair let's try this again so the newly
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
passed out Amendment Amendment
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
1039 should actually I hope replace the
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
first amendment I gave you um Roman
 
02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:54.870 align:start position:0%
first amendment I gave you um Roman
number

02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
three is same in both um and makes the
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
change of the notwithstanding any other
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
provision of the law to the contrary
 
02:56:06.349 --> 02:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
Roman number Roman number
 
02:56:11.429 --> 02:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
four adds lines 18 to 20 to the existing
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
statute So currently statutes says that
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
counties towns cities and Village
 
02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:18.710 align:start position:0%
counties towns cities and Village
districts

02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
cannot make regulations that are less
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
stringent than the state fire code this
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
is suggesting that they may also not
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
make them more
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
stringent this all came out of the
 
02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that's what I have I I
 
02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
think this makes a lot of sense and I
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
think that was one of the
 
02:56:39.469 --> 02:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations is that municipalities
 
02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
are able to make them more stringent so
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
if we um trust the fire code on the on
 
02:56:45.389 --> 02:56:45.399 align:start position:0%
the state level I'm I'm comfortable with
 
02:56:45.399 --> 02:56:46.190 align:start position:0%
the state level I'm I'm comfortable with
this

02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:56:49.070 --> 02:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
amendment anyone
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
else represent mcon thank you uh thank
 
02:56:55.710 --> 02:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
you both but Mr chairman um are we going
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
to discuss a further amendment to this
 
02:57:04.510 --> 02:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
construction I'm going to leave that up
 
02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
sponsor

02:57:14.510 --> 02:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
so two things directing this to the
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
experts in the audience
 
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
particularly uh Fire Marshall to me one
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
is the existing Amendment acceptable to
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
processed thank you Sean Tumi for the
 
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
record against St far Marshall uh my I
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't love it I know um obvious viously
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
but uh I guess it leaves me with a
 
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
couple of questions um especially when
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
we deal with mixed use buildings still
 
02:57:55.229 --> 02:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
um so if we had four Apartments upstairs
 
02:57:58.349 --> 02:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
from a commercial use
 
02:58:01.150 --> 02:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
um are we saying now that that building
 
02:58:03.870 --> 02:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
can't require a sprinkler system when it
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be a potential solution
 
02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
for um separations and things like that
 
02:58:10.349 --> 02:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's why I was hoping
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:58:14.590 --> 02:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
could uh well either a lot of the
 
02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
Amendments on the building of fire codes
 
02:58:19.630 --> 02:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
which are proceeding through or
 
02:58:23.950 --> 02:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
um just simply say like the compliance
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
with the state fire code I guess that's
 
02:58:29.229 --> 02:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
my concern is that it this really ties
 
02:58:31.870 --> 02:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
the hands on no sprinklers with up to
 
02:58:33.630 --> 02:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
four families I think and that the
 
02:58:36.110 --> 02:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems are used in some cases
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
especially in mixus as commercial
 
02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
residential or when we have as we talked
 
02:58:43.070 --> 02:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
about when there um very unique
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances that on especially on
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
egress and things like that that if we
 
02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
say no sprinklers at all I think it's
 
02:58:50.229 --> 02:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
going to it's going to make it harder
 
02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
for us to apply the code in some of
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
these cases I will say I
 
02:58:58.269 --> 02:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
fully I fully support where we're at as
 
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
far as um there are certain cases where
 
02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
there are four you know four unit
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings that existing that
 
02:59:07.349 --> 02:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
no sprinkles I'm okay with that um as
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
long as it meets the existing chapters
 
02:59:11.229 --> 02:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
for the Life Safety
 
02:59:11.239 --> 02:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
for the Life Safety
Code

02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
Code
 
02:59:18.990 --> 02:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
so if I may yep line six says in a
 
02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
structure used only for residential
 
02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
purposes how does that not address mixed
 
02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:26.030 align:start position:0%
purposes how does that not address mixed
juice

02:59:26.030 --> 02:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
juice
 
02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
buildings uh so that one says for
 
02:59:30.110 --> 02:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
detached one and two family dwellings
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
only I
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
think I think that L five and six are
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind of tied together so it doesn't
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
right okay representative
 
02:59:44.429 --> 02:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
verudi thank you Mr chairman
 
02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh Mr fire now if you had a mix use
 
02:59:50.110 --> 02:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
building wouldn't
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
the restrictor of the requirements go to
 
02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
a commercial and and that would take
 
02:59:59.070 --> 02:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
precedence over say this because it's
 
03:00:02.190 --> 03:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
not just residential would you have to
 
03:00:04.590 --> 03:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
live by the
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
commercial um ordinance where we're in
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
commercial as soon as we
 
03:00:12.269 --> 03:00:12.279 align:start position:0%
essentially pass the one and two family
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
dwelling kind of thing spot so but a far
 
03:00:18.830 --> 03:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
it but it's not an apartment say it's a
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
store or a some kind of shop now it's
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
not a residential
 
03:00:28.990 --> 03:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
use correct but it's it's still it's
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
still saying building it's sprinkler
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
system shall not in line eight sprinkler
 
03:00:35.150 --> 03:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
system shall not be required in existing
 
03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
buildings intended for maybe so so only
 
03:00:41.550 --> 03:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
for similar to the line above so there
 
03:00:42.990 --> 03:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
State Fire code ass will shall not
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
require fire Express or sprinkle systems
 
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
in new one or two family dwellings using
 
03:00:50.110 --> 03:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
or or
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
existing buildings up to no more than
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
four dwelling units used only for
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
residential purposes is that something
 
03:00:58.670 --> 03:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
to think about just I'm thinking out
 
03:01:00.269 --> 03:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
loud here which is dangerous the key is
 
03:01:11.429 --> 03:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.229 --> 03:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
right yeah so I I was just thinking a
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
lot which is always a little dangerous
 
03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
here right but the state fire code and
 
03:01:20.110 --> 03:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
Associated rules should not require fire
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
Express and sprinkle systems and detach
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
one or two family
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
dwellings dwelling units and a structure
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
used only for residential purposes if we
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
add in there uh after or two family
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
dwellings two dwelling units unless we
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
just go up to that's new so I think we
 
03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
need to add a a comma after the two
 
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
family dwelling units comma or
 
03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh where is it existing buildings
 
03:01:49.710 --> 03:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
intended for no more than four dwelling
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
units yeah
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
right so it's just the way the language
 
03:01:55.950 --> 03:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
was written instead of saying or two
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
family dwelling units you cross that out
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
and write dwelling units meant for four
 
03:02:04.750 --> 03:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
units or less right yeah we're existing
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I heard the new language in there
 
03:02:08.910 --> 03:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really opposed to the new idea
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
but um I I I get it for the existing but
 
03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:16.990 align:start position:0%
but um I I I get it for the existing but
go

03:02:16.990 --> 03:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:02:20.429 --> 03:02:20.439 align:start position:0%
ahead so be new representative Damon
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
Muki I think I'm
 
03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:28.110 align:start position:0%
Muki I think I'm
confused

03:02:28.110 --> 03:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
confused
 
03:02:30.349 --> 03:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
um so I think I heard you say two
 
03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
different things probably did so sorry
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
no no it's fine it's a work session so
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
one I do agree that we need to fix the
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
language I'm I was not trying to make
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
this be for mixed use buildings so I
 
03:02:46.990 --> 03:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
think we'll just sort out that language
 
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we amend the amendment
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
revise the amendment to do that but the
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
second part of what you just
 
03:02:57.550 --> 03:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
said what is the part that you are
 
03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:00.469 align:start position:0%
said what is the part that you are
opposed

03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.870 --> 03:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
to new new four
 
03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
units okay I thought you were saying new
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
language referring to the second half of
 
03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:09.309 align:start position:0%
language referring to the second half of
the

03:03:09.309 --> 03:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um so I let me try this
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
again I think I I think I wrote a you if
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
I may so Starry in line five the state
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
fire code and Associated rule shall not
 
03:03:22.110 --> 03:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
require fire suppression or sprinkler
 
03:03:24.670 --> 03:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
systems and detached one or two family
 
03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
systems and detached one or two family
dwelling

03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
units and this is where it be or
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
existing buildings for no more than four
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
purposes bam representing a coni yeah
 
03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
tot that's fine so now if I if I could
 
03:03:44.830 --> 03:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
our conversation was a lot of vacant
 
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings that are out there
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
and I agree that mixed residential has
 
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
its own hazards and need to be addressed
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
but it's it's putting those buildings
 
03:03:59.590 --> 03:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
into uh a residential way and if it's no
 
03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
more than four units and it can meet
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
other compliance codes that makes the
 
03:04:10.349 --> 03:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
them happy I that I think that is uh
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
fantastic I may ask my friend Ben behind
 
03:04:14.110 --> 03:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
me because I think he suggested the
 
03:04:15.790 --> 03:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision but
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we put that in front of
 
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
all of this or not
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't know this is the the
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment says notwithstanding right
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
after your proposed yeah I don't I don't
 
03:04:28.110 --> 03:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
my suggestion
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
is I'm wondering if we just get rid of
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
all the rest of that so
 
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
put notwithstanding other provision of
 
03:04:38.229 --> 03:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
the law to the contrary comma and then
 
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
go to line five the state fire code and
 
03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
Associate rules I have it drafted if you
 
03:04:45.389 --> 03:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
want to see it but I don't I don't think
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
you need the if we do what we said
 
03:04:51.790 --> 03:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
before you don't need the um if
 
03:04:53.070 --> 03:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with State Fire code
 
03:04:54.670 --> 03:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
including not limit to fire barriers
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's already in the code like I I
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
think that that's already there and we
 
03:05:01.229 --> 03:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
can talk about it um means of Escape
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
windows and monitored fire alarm like I
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
don't think this says monitored fire
 
03:05:07.070 --> 03:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
alarm systems monitored fire alarm
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
systems aren't required for except for
 
03:05:10.510 --> 03:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
bigger buildings so if you're asking to
 
03:05:12.150 --> 03:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
put them in I'm good with that but
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's adding a cost for commercial fire
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
alarm so being so I think if you just
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
stop it at the top that first five and
 
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
six with a little I can give this to you
 
03:05:26.510 --> 03:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
03:05:30.910 --> 03:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
um I would just cut seven through 11 and
 
03:05:33.190 --> 03:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
let the code be the code on that side of
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
it so that we're
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
not 100 itself I just don't have I just
 
03:05:40.950 --> 03:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
my question added question was just do
 
03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
we need the notwithstanding that's all
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer representative D Lorenzo then
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative yell okay thank you Mr
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
here and thank you for taking my
 
03:05:56.670 --> 03:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
question so um following up on the
 
03:05:56.680 --> 03:05:58.710 align:start position:0%
question so um following up on the
praise

03:05:58.710 --> 03:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
praise
 
03:06:01.790 --> 03:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
um monitored fire alarm systems what are
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
we talking about when we say monitored
 
03:06:06.510 --> 03:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
fire alarm systems so it would be the
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
like the systems that in this building
 
03:06:10.670 --> 03:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
basically the horn strobes the detectors
 
03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
and all that so typically a a small
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
a small residential like would be like
 
03:06:17.229 --> 03:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
you home where I hope you have a smok
 
03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
and carbon monoxide in each level of
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
your home and you have a smoke alarm in
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
your bedroom and that's what but the way
 
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is written monitored firearm system
 
03:06:27.309 --> 03:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
would require a a syst a commercial
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
system likes in this building that
 
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
reports out offsite and things like that
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
which for a small residential that's
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
typically not required so so the new
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
amended language would scratch that out
 
03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that we wouldn't have that concern in
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
there um represent Vella
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um just
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
to kind
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
of see if I'm on on the same page um
 
03:06:56.670 --> 03:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
you're thinking from line five to 7
 
03:06:58.830 --> 03:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
replaced with not withstanding any other
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
PR provision of law to the contrary the
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
state fire code and Associated rules
 
03:07:05.590 --> 03:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
shall not require fire suppression or
 
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in detach one or two
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
family dwelling units or existing
 
03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
building uh
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
for use no uh for no more than four
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
dwelling units um intended solely for
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
residential use intended solely for res
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh or in a structure used only for
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
residential use correct okay okay so
 
03:07:38.190 --> 03:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
um that seems okay so I'm going to put
 
03:07:39.990 --> 03:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon in charge of that
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm okay with that language is there
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
anybody that's not okay with that
 
03:07:46.750 --> 03:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
keep uh yes we're going to keep Roman
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
numeral four and it's going to say at
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
the end however counties cities towns
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
Village districts shall not adopt rules
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
regulations ordinances that are more
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
stringent than the state fire code
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
relative to residential sprinkler
 
03:07:59.349 --> 03:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
systems which is specific to residential
 
03:08:01.389 --> 03:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
which was my question earlier so that's
 
03:08:03.070 --> 03:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
fine with you I'm okay with that I had a
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
phone call this week last week asking me
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
why do we make it so hard to put systems
 
03:08:08.229 --> 03:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
in from someone that wanted to put it in
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
so love it let's make it easier
 
03:08:13.830 --> 03:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent Kella um I'm just wondering
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
about this line um 18 to 20 if
 
03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
about this line um 18 to 20 if
we

03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
um about the the possibility of possibly
 
03:08:24.399 --> 03:08:26.990 align:start position:0%
um about the the possibility of possibly
saying

03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
saying
that

03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
we if we're already going to get an
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to this however uh that we
 
03:08:37.469 --> 03:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
include in addition to relative uh to
 
03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
residential sprinker systems we say um
 
03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
residential sprinker systems we say um
or

03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:46.590 align:start position:0%
or
occupancy

03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh residential residential occupancy
 
03:08:52.229 --> 03:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
because yeah I I don't want to I don't
 
03:08:55.229 --> 03:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
want to add that language it's G to
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
muddy it up a little bit I'd rather just
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
keep it to what we I understand I
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
understand you want to take a bigger
 
03:09:04.269 --> 03:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
bite of the Apple but I personally think
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten to a point where the
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall is not openly opposed to
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
this bill hopefully not um so I'd
 
03:09:13.469 --> 03:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
consider that a win and then where also
 
03:09:15.469 --> 03:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
making it easier for people to build
 
03:09:16.830 --> 03:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
more units inside their existing
 
03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
buildings all right I don't you're a
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
member of this Committee just like me
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what I would
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
say represent
 
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
makoni um thank you and I I guess I'd
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
direct this to uh Fire Marshall Tumi um
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
line 13 first four
 
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
words if um I I see him is unnecessary
 
03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe the governor has directed
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
language to remove that uh and I believe
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's referring to if he or she findes
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
which I think is referring to the State
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal if you were sitting there
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
as a woman I believe that woman would
 
03:09:55.950 --> 03:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
still be the fire
 
03:09:58.710 --> 03:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
marshal I would ask that you strike that
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
language so I believe the governor's
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
already instructed uh departments to do
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
that and it's no disrespect to the other
 
03:10:08.590 --> 03:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
it's just not
 
03:10:10.990 --> 03:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so you would so in the
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Damon you would
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
strike here she
 
03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
strike here she
finds

03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
that stsh may exemp a building structure
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
equipment from such
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:43.349 align:start position:0%
equipment from such
rules

03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:10:46.110 --> 03:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
exemption yes so not just that you have
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
to go yeah you have to go all the way so
 
03:10:52.030 --> 03:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
the the for the words would be he or she
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
finds that strike
 
03:10:57.910 --> 03:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that I will say that OS has been
 
03:11:00.269 --> 03:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
directed to always add she wherever
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
there's a he in existing statute so I
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what the governor's
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
instruction is the governor came out
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
War directing that we not necessary
 
03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:22.510 --> 03:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
biry noer associated with that term
 
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
representa Representative no I do
 
03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
understand that the title has no gender
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
I It's just sometimes pronouns have to
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
be used in a sentence and then and then
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
you always have to include
 
03:11:38.349 --> 03:11:38.359 align:start position:0%
those okay so um I
 
03:11:40.830 --> 03:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
see correct me if I'm wrong I see us
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
being able to exact 1065 11
 
03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:46.389 align:start position:0%
being able to exact 1065 11
168

03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
168
 
03:11:46.399 --> 03:11:48.389 align:start position:0%
168
1215

03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
1215
 
03:11:52.750 --> 03:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
13 I'm looking at this sheet right here
 
03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
13 I'm looking at this sheet right here
yep

03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:11:54.880 --> 03:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
yep
1065

03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.910 --> 03:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
two she's here for the um duplex bill in
 
03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
the parking bill right 1399
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
1400 I'm going I'm going to
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think we can get the duplex
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
done but definitely parking we'll see
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
um all depends on OS too I might I might
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
show up here one and recess this to 1:30
 
03:12:25.469 --> 03:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
the executive session to give OS more
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
time um but so we're gon to
 
03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:32.190 align:start position:0%
time um but so we're gon to
1065

03:12:32.190 --> 03:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
1065
 
03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:34.750 align:start position:0%
1065
1168

03:12:34.750 --> 03:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
1168
 
03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:41.630 align:start position:0%
1168
1215

03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:47.070 align:start position:0%
 
1361

03:12:47.070 --> 03:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
1291 okay and then we're going to right
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
now we're going to bring
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
up 1399 and and 1400 so um is there
 
03:12:57.150 --> 03:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee that
 
03:12:59.469 --> 03:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
disagrees with me on on at least that
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
bills we haven't talked about 1168
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
yet we can we quickly talk about 1168
 
03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
since I haven't Amendment for it and
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
before we move on to all right um we're
 
03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
having I'm going to break at 12:30
 
03:13:24.070 --> 03:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
yep okay so I'm gonna call I'll do 11
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
168 briefly if possible very briefly go
 
03:13:29.710 --> 03:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
ahead there is before you and now I will
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
have to find it in my list of any papers
 
03:13:38.830 --> 03:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
prepared ah with the assistance of nhcd
 
03:13:46.110 --> 03:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
and it's still a study committee the
 
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
only thing it does is it adds um a
 
03:13:52.590 --> 03:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
substantial list of uh organizations
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
that the study committee would solicit
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
testimony or solicit input from so the
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire count these are all the
 
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
organizations we heard testimony from
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council on developmental
 
03:14:04.190 --> 03:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities able and H Institute on
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
disability Etc and it also adds our
 
03:14:10.990 --> 03:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee as one of the entities that
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
would be reported to
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the study committee and I
 
03:14:18.910 --> 03:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
think that um understanding that we are
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
a special committee now we will still be
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
in existence technically as of November
 
03:14:25.229 --> 03:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
1st I did look into changing the date of
 
03:14:27.790 --> 03:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
the reporting date it is in statute that
 
03:14:29.550 --> 03:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
we H that study committees legislative
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
study committees have to report November
 
03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
1st so I couldn't change that um but uh
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
and I also required a minimum of six
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
meetings for the study committee because
 
03:14:41.950 --> 03:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
I thought they needed to U be sure to
 
03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
take it serious iously so that is the
 
03:14:46.990 --> 03:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment before you um and the prime
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
amendment any comments on this amendment
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
or the bill representative yokal I mean
 
03:15:00.269 --> 03:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna go into the exec session
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
now but
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
um I still believe that um
 
03:15:13.870 --> 03:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
even wasting the time I of of crossing
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and waiting for the
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
governor to sign it and then 40 45 day
 
03:15:26.229 --> 03:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
um 45 days after being signed or being
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
effective to being unnecessary
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
delays that this that just to choose
 
03:15:36.870 --> 03:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
another four
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
representatives from the house to make
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is is a part of
 
03:15:51.189 --> 03:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
housing I think that it's unnecessary
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
that we could form a
 
03:15:58.750 --> 03:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee within this committee and
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
even maybe a joint committee with
 
03:16:04.349 --> 03:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
another committee um a joint
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with another committee and
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
start hearings next week and have them
 
03:16:12.710 --> 03:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
every week until um people uh have feel
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
like they've been heard and we all the
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues are addressed I don't um so I
 
03:16:20.349 --> 03:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
think that actually passing the
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill takes longer and gives less
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity and it has to be reported
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
out by November 1st where we could have
 
03:16:33.070 --> 03:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
hearings until whenever we wanted um and
 
03:16:35.309 --> 03:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
report whenever we want I I feel like
 
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's constraining it's it's delaying the
 
03:16:39.630 --> 03:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
issue for some matter of time so I just
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand why it would be um
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that's more of a comment for the
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
exec session I guess I'm wondering if
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
you have any edits to the amendment that
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
was proposed I think that the amendment
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
is very helpful as far as like if this
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to you know start
 
03:16:59.309 --> 03:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling the stuff that that is listed
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
in these in these
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh these things because that's one of
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
the things that I was asking for kind of
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the hearing was that these
 
03:17:13.550 --> 03:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
these groups that we need to listen to
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
um be identified that this is this
 
03:17:19.229 --> 03:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
achieves that goal but okay is the
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
committee ready to exec the
 
03:17:25.189 --> 03:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill I see yes okay we're going to move
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
on to um hp400 I'm going to call on
 
03:17:31.150 --> 03:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams to come up I
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
believe she has an amendment to that um
 
03:17:34.990 --> 03:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully
 
03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
if we might need to
 
03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh move
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
into we might need to wait to Z your
 
03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:44.469 align:start position:0%
into we might need to wait to Z your
other

03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
bill but let's uh let's do
 
03:17:51.189 --> 03:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
1400 thank you very much chair Alexander
 
03:17:53.389 --> 03:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh you should all have Amendment to
 
03:17:57.189 --> 03:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
hb400 the number is 2024
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
853h pass it out to everybody let me
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
know if you don't have one I've got
 
03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:03.389 align:start position:0%
know if you don't have one I've got
extra

03:18:03.389 --> 03:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
extra
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so we've already had the hearing on
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
this uh this is that the one you emailed
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
out I emailed two out so this one went
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
out probably a week and a half ago this
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
is a really simple parking Amendment um
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
just to clean up the language about one
 
03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
parking space per unit I sent one last
 
03:18:24.670 --> 03:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
night as well related to um the duplex
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill but I don't know if we're going to
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
parking good okay all right so um what
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
we heard in the in the hearing and part
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the discussion I had with you
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful folks on the committee um is
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
that it was a little confusing to use
 
03:18:46.590 --> 03:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
the words minimum and maximum when
 
03:18:48.269 --> 03:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
talking about Municipal parking
 
03:18:50.830 --> 03:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and so this bill has been
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
cleaned up to remove either of those
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
words um so on lines 1011 and 12 uh
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
really we're talking about requirements
 
03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
so a municipality shall not require more
 
03:19:06.630 --> 03:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
than one residential parking space per
 
03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
unit to remove the words minimum and
 
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
maximum because that got a little
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
confusing um so that was the cleanup on
 
03:19:16.150 --> 03:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I'm happy to answer
 
03:19:18.269 --> 03:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
questions or join in the discussion or
 
03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know any comments on this any
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions for the the sponsor of this
 
03:19:24.349 --> 03:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it clears up the
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
language go ahead represent Reed thank
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
you and thank you representative and I
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bill and the cleanup um I
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
just remember that we had some
 
03:19:36.750 --> 03:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
conversation around um a community will
 
03:19:41.550 --> 03:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
consider off premise parking options in
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
their requ requirements so um was was
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
that intentionally not put into the
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think you're confusing
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
this bill with a different one the off
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
premise parking yeah was that was part
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
of your
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
Adu sorry oh okay I may have been
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%

changes from the prior Amendment okay
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
other other comments on this bill EXC
 
04:22:37.389 --> 04:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
representative Gib Mr chair um I
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear which Bill are we on 1361
 
04:22:40.960 --> 04:22:42.510 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear which Bill are we on 1361
thank

04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
you represent coni uh thank you Mr
 
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm satisfied with the
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
Amendments and we'll be voting in favor
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.070 --> 04:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
point anyone else representative yella I
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
mean I think that the well speaking to
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment even though the amendment
 
04:23:06.109 --> 04:23:06.119 align:start position:0%
is the bill as a whole um I think that
 
04:23:06.119 --> 04:23:07.950 align:start position:0%
is the bill as a whole um I think that
the

04:23:07.950 --> 04:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
I still have the concerns about like I
 
04:23:13.630 --> 04:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
feel like this is a little bit of a baby
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
step but I think that the discussion
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
that we heard before about making it
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
clear that there is um you know
 
04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic opportunities
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
of expansion of manufactured housing
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
Parks I didn't include the the
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
subdivision thing on on the second page
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
as you as you uh no just
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure that how
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
relevant expansion of
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
existing subdivisions is um I'm not sure
 
04:23:51.389 --> 04:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
how often that like how many cases that
 
04:23:54.109 --> 04:23:54.119 align:start position:0%
actually would cover um you know
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
assuming that you have lots around you
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
um that you could add and generally
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
subdivisions have you know like a street
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
or something that you're like unlikely
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
to just like drive through into a new
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
lot or something like that so just I
 
04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that it wasn't completely uh
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and so in in the spirit of
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
less is more
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is is less as as of
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
of bill that I could support as far as
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
um just cleaning up some language and
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some minor uh
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
expansion um kind of in line with what
 
04:24:37.710 --> 04:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander Ander said uh
 
04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
earlier um so even without a further
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendment of you know specifying how
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
that these Lots need to be you know un
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
developed already and stuff like that I
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
think that this is is I would obviously
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
prefer those types of things but um I
 
04:24:59.469 --> 04:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
think that this is okay I would be okay
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
with passing this just as is and and
 
04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't need further amendment to vote for
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
it on the floor so okay representative
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
read thank you Mr chair uh as a member
 
04:25:12.429 --> 04:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
of the this little bigger bite of the
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
Apple caucus that we have going on here
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything representative
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
yela said and uh am still okay with us
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
moving this forward as is to get what we
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah and I agree and and and I
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
think that we need to message better
 
04:25:33.870 --> 04:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
with other legislators on what
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing looks like and I
 
04:25:36.910 --> 04:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a good step in that
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
direction um so I hope that you'll
 
04:25:43.149 --> 04:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
explain this to members but um I think
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
this is a good rewrite and makes it
 
04:25:47.309 --> 04:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
clear about what we're looking for as a
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
yella um I guess I just have a question
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
04:26:01.870 --> 04:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
um the intent of the the chair in that
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
you seem to be trying to have this be a
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
messaging tool in which case you may not
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
want something like this to go on
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
consent because you actually want to
 
04:26:15.750 --> 04:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
talk about it on the floor um as a
 
04:26:18.109 --> 04:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
messaging tool kind of a thing um it
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
could be a messaging tool and it can
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
still go on consent okay I I just wanted
 
04:26:24.030 --> 04:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
to I love that's a good place for it to
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
be yes okay any other comments represent
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
Damon I just want to follow up on that
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
concept of messaging to real quick
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
explore how we can facilitate that more
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
broadly than in individual conversations
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
which by nature take time and can we do
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
an infomercial in mailboxes I have um
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
the chair has an idea in the works and
 
04:26:49.389 --> 04:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
I'll share it with you offline
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
great representative Reed I don't know
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
if the idea in the works has anything to
 
04:26:55.469 --> 04:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
do with this but at bare minimum I think
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
that our committee could release a press
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
release regarding this and perhaps like
 
04:27:03.149 --> 04:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
maybe all the bills that we pass
 
04:27:07.710 --> 04:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
yep okay just one more visuals because
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
people's image of manufactured housing
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
is not up to date in many cases it's
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%

as previously discussed in work session
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply adds to the study
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee a list of entities most of
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
which we had heard directly from um
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um entities that
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be solicited information from by
 
04:31:25.469 --> 04:31:25.479 align:start position:0%
the study committee and ads our
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
particular in in kind of in response to
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative yoel's uh comments from
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh as our particular
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee as a as an that would be
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
reported to by the study committee being
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we would be likely the ones to deal
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
with any proposed
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
it any other comments on HB
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
1168 I'm going to say for for me
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
personally I I think that um this this
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee was created to deal with
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
finding Solutions the housing crisis I
 
04:32:04.030 --> 04:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
was personally shocked by how many
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
people came in to for a public hearing
 
04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
on a study committee bill um I think the
 
04:32:10.990 --> 04:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill although I'm hesitant to create
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
study committees I think the bill um
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
would would at least appease those
 
04:32:18.750 --> 04:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
members that want to be heard more and
 
04:32:20.349 --> 04:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
and the in the representatives that want
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
to serve on that committee specifically
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
give them the opportunity to study it so
 
04:32:26.910 --> 04:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
it any other comments Mr repres Lorenzo
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
I think um looking at how many people
 
04:32:36.189 --> 04:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
showed up for the hearing and how many
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
people testified um there is a great
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
great great need for this type of
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
Housing and I hope that we can actually
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
do it with all deliberate speed thank
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
you represent mononi uh thank you Mr
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I have the pleasure of serving on
 
04:32:57.000 --> 04:32:58.590 align:start position:0%
um I have the pleasure of serving on
several

04:32:58.590 --> 04:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
commissions and the issue always which
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
the issue was brought up by represent o
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
Kella is that it takes so long to go
 
04:33:09.789 --> 04:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
through the process and by the time
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
you're reporting it's impossible to have
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
meetings so if you're I I agreed with
 
04:33:17.310 --> 04:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative Kella that keep it as a
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
work group but if if the commit if we
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
want to pass this I would hope that you
 
04:33:26.189 --> 04:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
would uh you would then permit this
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
other this group ad hoc or whatever to
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
start right away and start holding
 
04:33:33.551 --> 04:33:33.561 align:start position:0%
hearings until you get a formal
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
committee otherwise it will will not be
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
enough time for all these people to be
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reed I just wanted
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
to agree that um if we can do this uh
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
informally or or through our rules or
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
internal processes to start the process
 
04:33:59.830 --> 04:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
before this is enacted I do think
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
considering how many people showed up
 
04:34:03.789 --> 04:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
and the the intricacies and depth of the
 
04:34:05.470 --> 04:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
problems that exist that we should
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee this committee through statute
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
but having said that if we can start
 
04:34:11.789 --> 04:34:11.799 align:start position:0%
getting the ball rolling as soon as
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
possible um and just add to that then I
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be wholeheartedly supportive of
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
that okay representative
 
04:34:24.670 --> 04:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you so to that end the bill
 
04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
text says that it takes effect on
 
04:34:29.629 --> 04:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
passage is there process by which we
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
could expedite the
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
passage um there's another whole body in
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
the process
 
04:34:38.910 --> 04:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
um that so we we can get it on the
 
04:34:38.920 --> 04:34:40.230 align:start position:0%
um that so we we can get it on the
calendar

04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
as as early as
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
mid 22nd I believe 22nd of March 21st of
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
March um but after that it's out of our
 
04:34:53.910 --> 04:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
hands once it goes over the other body
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
ask the the chair of this body in this
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall um to uh
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
fast track
 
04:35:01.760 --> 04:35:03.390 align:start position:0%
fast track
it

04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right is the show hands for the
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
amendment okay can you repeat the
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
amendment number representative Reed
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
04:35:12.750 --> 04:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
0927 okay all those in favor of
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
amendment number 0927 please raise your
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
hand those opposed we're unanimous
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
awesome is there any more discussion on
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
viella thank you um I'm still going to
 
04:35:30.510 --> 04:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
vote in opposition to this bill as
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
amended um I believe that the mo proper
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
motion is interim study and then we will
 
04:35:43.390 --> 04:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
produce a moot uh the report in November
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
when we get when we completed the
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
interim study part and um the then we
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
will be able to start this right away
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and we can have and we could do this as
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee um task with that interim
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
study process and it could be uh we can
 
04:36:05.949 --> 04:36:05.959 align:start position:0%
invite you know members from DHHS or or
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
um Edna and and uh you know start on
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
this work and have it go as long as
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
needed instead of trying to finagle you
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
know a senator to show up and and
 
04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that that the it's just
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
the improper motion and so I'm going to
 
04:36:28.109 --> 04:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
be opposing the ought to pass but I
 
04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
think that it's obviously an a needed
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
thing to look into but I don't think
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
that for new Representatives
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
task with relatively the same task that
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
we are here I'm not trying to pass the
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
buck to other Representatives I I'm I'm
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
on it I'm in this for the Long Haul and
 
04:36:47.709 --> 04:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm willing to put in the time and
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
effort so representative Reed thank you
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative I
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your Viewpoint and I I
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
think the fact that you pointed out that
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
we could be doing more work as a
 
04:37:03.070 --> 04:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee um in other modes rather than
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
just this formal study committee is well
 
04:37:08.189 --> 04:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
taken uh I am a little bit dismayed at a
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
motion or a proposed motion to interim
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
study a study committee but having said
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that without the interim study my
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is the chair can produce
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
or on his is at his discretion to create
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
a uh a work group and can invite perhaps
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
members of the disability caucus from
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the house to that work group and perhaps
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
we invite Senate members as well but
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be present in order
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
for us to proceed with that work
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
so um I think that we can do this in a
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
two-pronged approach and still guarantee
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
a an official study committee to all of
 
04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
the many people who came out to testify
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
to us while still helping support that
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
um through our own work
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
group representative Walsh
 
04:37:53.719 --> 04:37:54.990 align:start position:0%
group representative Walsh
representative

04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh I also
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
understand Representatives
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative yoko's point and it's
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that the time limit uh on
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
the study committee or commission uh
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
will be so short but this could I I'm
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
going to support OTP on this bill
 
04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
because this committee was set up to
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
address the housing crisis in general
 
04:38:24.189 --> 04:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that um uh a separate focus
 
04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
on the needs of people with disabilities
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
value represent Lorenzo um a dose of
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
reality we all we all have to recognize
 
04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
that this is an election year we're
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
going to be pretty darn busy between uh
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
June and November so does that to
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
consider as well thank
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed um I forgot to
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
mention a piece of the amendment and it
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
does mandate and I I did the math on
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
after this would be theoretically signed
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
in June to the reporting deadline in
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
November it does mandate at least at
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
least at a minimum of six meetings of
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
this study committee which would average
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
out one every two weeks so we are in
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment insisting that they do
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
that work whereas an unofficial process
 
04:39:18.910 --> 04:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
up okay if there's no more discussion um
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
see none Clark will call the rooll on
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%

04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%

hp400 relative to maximum number of
 
04:40:36.510 --> 04:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
residents parking
 
04:40:41.070 --> 04:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
spaces I move out to pass
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay is there an amendment is there a
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
yella would you like to move an
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to I would like to move
 
04:40:57.628 --> 04:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
0853 okay and that's been seconded as
 
04:41:01.628 --> 04:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
well okay would you like to speak to
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
your motion uh yes I think it is very
 
04:41:07.470 --> 04:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
important that we ensure that towns do
 
04:41:07.480 --> 04:41:08.788 align:start position:0%
important that we ensure that towns do
not

04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
um restrict de facto restrict um kind of
 
04:41:16.350 --> 04:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
in a bad faith way restrict the uh
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
building of new housing in our terrible
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
housing crisis currently by requiring uh
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
on the municipal level uh more parking
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
spaces than needed this would set that
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
standard at no more than one per unit um
 
04:41:33.788 --> 04:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment I I guess I was speaking
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill but the amendment um
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies what was confusing language
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
because it said maximum but minimum but
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's you know is it the state requiring
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
a maximum of no more than a minimum of
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
so instead of getting into that what
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
does maximum minimum mean it says simply
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
shall not require more than one
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
residential parking space per unit it
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies the original
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah this I believe your
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative yella seconded both
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
motions we on the amendment we're on the
 
04:42:08.718 --> 04:42:10.750 align:start position:0%
motions we on the amendment we're on the
amendment

04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:42:15.070 --> 04:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
Damon so I'm just noting that the
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
effective date of the amendment is
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
different from the effective date of the
 
04:42:22.110 --> 04:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
original it's
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
later sry you you are correct yes I am
 
04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
sad to see that um it my understanding
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
is January 1 of the following year is
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
the procedure actually required by
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
Statute for any legislation that creates
 
04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
a new criminal code like a new crime it
 
04:42:42.030 --> 04:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it's not appropriate to be on
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment having said that I'm not
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
sure that six months is going to make a
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
big difference in the world of the the
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
towns yeah it's got to do with
 
04:42:53.708 --> 04:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
publishing of the zoning ordinances and
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
adjust any
 
04:43:03.550 --> 04:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
comments represent Broody thank you Mr
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
being from Manchester there's a lot of
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
units in Manchester and some buildings
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
don't even have one parking space per
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
unit so um the cities can get around it
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
I was a president of a condo association
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
where we had one parking space per unit
 
04:43:25.628 --> 04:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
and there was 36 units in the building
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
and we only had four parking spaces
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
designed for uh visitors out of 36 units
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
so parking and residential are is um
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
people find a way to do it um you get
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions on parking more in the
 
04:43:44.430 --> 04:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
commercial and like the restaurants and
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
things they you know designated a lot of
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
parking but residential units I don't
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
adequate representative walson yeah
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair um and I do agree with
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
what this this bill is trying to do I
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
agree that the municipality shouldn't be
 
04:44:06.110 --> 04:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
using parking as a way to uh deter
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
development but it I just I I have a
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
fear of some of the problems that of one
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
size fits all like this can create in my
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
time on the planning board we had
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
countless um people coming in that lived
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
in apartment buildings uh condos tow
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
houses that we were giving two parking
 
04:44:27.390 --> 04:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
spaces and they were still clamoring for
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
more uh particularly in the holiday
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
periods and visitors I mean there was no
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
place for anybody to park other than
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
than taking somebody else's parking
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
place which causes even more problems I
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
just one per unit I think is really
 
04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
tough it doesn't take into consideration
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
how many bedrooms um I'm not going to
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
fight this I don't think I can support
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
it because I'm I fear it causing more
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
problems than it than it solves I think
 
04:44:55.470 --> 04:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably a better way to get
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
where we want to with this in terms of
 
04:45:00.910 --> 04:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh abusing municipalities but I don't
 
04:45:02.430 --> 04:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
know if this is
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
it representative Reed
 
04:45:08.430 --> 04:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh I do understand the
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
clamoring for more parking as someone
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
who frequently goes to Portsmith and
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
obviously has to park um in in conquered
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
frequently and I don't use the parking
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
garage as often as others um I
 
04:45:25.150 --> 04:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
understand the frustration of not having
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
a place to park however um as was
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
brilliantly pointed out earlier today in
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
hearing uh by a question by
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace and then an
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
answer from person
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
testifying as frustrating as parking can
 
04:45:41.550 --> 04:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
be we have a housing crisis we do not
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a parking crisis people don't die
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
of uh the freezing cold if they don't
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
have parking um people aren't you know
 
04:45:52.030 --> 04:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't go into a situation where they
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
can't work or can't clean themselves or
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
can't do the things that are necessary
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
for life because they don't have parking
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
so I think our priority has to be taken
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
care of the parking and I don't think
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
this is necessarily A one- siiz fits-all
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
although I can understand that interpret
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
of course municipalities could simply
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.868 --> 04:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
unit representative
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um I
 
04:46:19.440 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um I
definitely

04:46:20.920 --> 04:46:20.930 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:22.590 align:start position:0%
definitely
[Music]

04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
do kind of agree with representative
 
04:46:28.868 --> 04:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
Reed however I wouldn't have used those
 
04:46:36.430 --> 04:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the kind of
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
of of a
 
04:46:48.320 --> 04:46:50.390 align:start position:0%
of of a
project

04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
may need
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
May address the the needs of the people
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
that it's trying to Target right if they
 
04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
might be targeting uh someone right next
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
to uh right on the
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh that that uh you know works right
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
next door is has a um has some some
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
business tied to it essentially where
 
04:47:18.910 --> 04:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's just employees and so you have some
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
some other means of transportation or
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
you could be right next to a bus line or
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
all of these types of things I think
 
04:47:29.310 --> 04:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
that the one- siiz fits all is mandating
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
the um the requirement of multiple um
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
parking spaces even when that your
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
target audience for that uh is not
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
needing of all of those parking spaces
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so I think that
 
04:47:52.110 --> 04:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the flexibility really
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh allows for those those people that
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
are developing it that to understand
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
kind of who their target audience is if
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
their target audience is families with
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
children they're going to need you know
 
04:48:08.110 --> 04:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
multiple cars they're going to design
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
that into their project and not leave
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
them kind of stranded on the side of the
 
04:48:17.548 --> 04:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
road um but they if they're not
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
targeting that then they might not put
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
as many parking spaces um and so I kind
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
of leave that up to the kind of plans
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the development and then if the you
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
know and then the cost associated with
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
that with those you know do I need to
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
pay for that additional parking space if
 
04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be using it or um I
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to inflate artificially the
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
cost of that housing and so I think that
 
04:48:45.510 --> 04:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
we just leave it up to the market if
 
04:48:48.430 --> 04:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
those if if you build houses with only
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh one parking space and that's not
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
enough for you and you can't fill it
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
then I think that the market will will
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh decide and you're the value of those
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
property will be diminished if you if
 
04:49:03.548 --> 04:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
you had just planned better uh when you
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
were in the planning process of your
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
development so I think that uh it will
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
all work itself out in the wash my
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you representative
 
04:49:16.510 --> 04:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair I think it's
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
important to note that while uh this
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
provision would forbid the um
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
municipality from requiring more than
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
one parking space per unit uh there is
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in this in this proposal that
 
04:49:34.750 --> 04:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
would prevent
 
04:49:34.760 --> 04:49:36.628 align:start position:0%
would prevent
uh

04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
the municipality from allowing more than
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
one parking space per unit if the
 
04:49:45.070 --> 04:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
developer chose to provide two parking
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
spaces per unit they could still do that
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's only that the
 
04:49:53.190 --> 04:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
municipality uh could not require more
 
04:49:53.200 --> 04:49:58.510 align:start position:0%
municipality uh could not require more
than

04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.620 --> 04:50:00.630 align:start position:0%
one representative
 
04:50:00.630 --> 04:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
one representative

[Music]
 
04:50:04.150 --> 04:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
walls again I'm not going to fight this
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
but I'll
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
leave one last comment on it based on a
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
comment I heard a minute ago solutions
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
to our housing crisis does not mean the
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
end result has to
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
be I don't know flawed development um
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
again there's nothing that stops a
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
municipality from putting an Ordnance in
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
that says they only need one themselves
 
04:50:28.350 --> 04:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
now I'll leave it at
 
04:50:31.230 --> 04:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
that represent birdie thank you Mr
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
think the word was used housing crisis
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
we have a housing shortage I think
 
04:50:40.510 --> 04:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
people would rather have a roof over
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
their head than an extra parking
 
04:50:48.990 --> 04:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
space I consider um my opinion is one
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
parking space is the dimension of what a
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
bedroom can be um I think the market is
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
very smart I think the market can adjust
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
I think developers are going to build
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
what the needs of the community are
 
04:51:03.150 --> 04:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise nobody's going to go and live
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
in that place so I believe strongly that
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
if if there is a need for more parking
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
if there's a need for visitor spots if
 
04:51:12.510 --> 04:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's a need for um three parking
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
spaces per unit the developer is going
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
to build it I think the Market's very
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
powerful thing I will also say
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
that when
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
we I lost my train of thought I I think
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Market's a very powerful thing um I
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
think that we're going to adjust out of
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
this and one parking space is completely
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable I think sometimes
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities this is what I was going
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
to say I think sometimes municipalities
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
use parking as a way to deny a project
 
04:51:41.868 --> 04:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
merely because they do not want the
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
project in their community and I don't
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that's fair um I think it is
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
borderline discriminatory I think we
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
need to as a state Clause some of that
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
power back because I think in some ways
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
that happens and we've heard that from
 
04:51:56.788 --> 04:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
developers we've heard that from um
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
people that have come to testify so I'm
 
04:52:00.430 --> 04:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to support this bill I think it's
 
04:52:04.030 --> 04:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable um restriction and I
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
um it it's helping to balance the power
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
between the state municipalities
 
04:52:09.440 --> 04:52:10.750 align:start position:0%
between the state municipalities
regarding

04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
parking Mr chair representative D
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair this brings
 
04:52:17.310 --> 04:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
to mind a development that we have in
 
04:52:19.628 --> 04:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
the town of New Market the new market
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
Mills there is no parking on site um
 
04:52:28.750 --> 04:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
there is a municipal lot where residents
 
04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
of um the mill can park and it's part of
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
I guess it's part of the Lea park there
 
04:52:33.480 --> 04:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
I guess it's part of the Lea park there
but

04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's mixed with commercial other
 
04:52:38.830 --> 04:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
commercial um Enterprises and and it
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
works um so with a with's a will is away
 
04:52:44.430 --> 04:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Walsh and
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reed yeah last one on
 
04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
this and that's my point about one siiz
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
fits-all in the cities large
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities you can get away with
 
04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
zero parking because there are streets
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere there are parking garages
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere it works my issue in the in
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the development that I've
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
seen is in the more rural areas where we
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
still want this type of deel elment
 
04:53:06.030 --> 04:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
where there on no roads they've got
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
their driveway or they're walking a half
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
a mile to to the the local Road it's a
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at apples versus oranges
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
and trying to say that you can only do
 
04:53:18.990 --> 04:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
this one per unit um in in two things
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
that aren't similar that's my only point
 
04:53:23.310 --> 04:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
and again I would like to come to some
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
language that would solve the
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities that abuse but I don't
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
04:53:33.628 --> 04:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
it representative Reed thank you um the
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
the chair uh kind of well said the
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
comments I had earlier which is what I
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
heard representative yela saying and
 
04:53:42.430 --> 04:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
eventually got to the word market the
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
free market can fix this um that the
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
demand may one day be for more parking
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
but right now we know we all know the
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
demand is for more housing and we heard
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
testimony to the fact that you can put
 
04:53:58.030 --> 04:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
housing where there currently is
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
required parking that goes empty empty
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
house empty parking in my own um
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
apartment complex is a matter of fact uh
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
to the point about New Market since
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
representative dealer and I share a
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
HomeTown um New Market is not a city it
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
does not have a parking garage and the
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
new market Mills despite not having the
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
parking as representative deal Enzo laid
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
out is the most desirable uh rentals in
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
in New Market it is considered extremely
 
04:54:27.390 --> 04:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
desirable to live there and they go for
 
04:54:32.350 --> 04:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
a very uh pretty penny so again uh one
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
per unit is enough and uh the market can
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
sort the rest
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
out representative
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I don't want to
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
belabor the point but uh as several of
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
us have said this provision would not
 
04:54:50.430 --> 04:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
prevent a developer from providing more
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
than one parking space if it's judged
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
that more than one parking space is
 
04:54:57.750 --> 04:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
needed it only prevents the municipality
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
from requiring more than one parking
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
space if in fact it's the type of
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
development that needs more parking then
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
the developer uh or owner landlord
 
04:55:11.788 --> 04:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
whoever it might be um can do what they
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to do to provide
 
04:55:16.830 --> 04:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
it representative Walsh thank you Mr
 
04:55:19.628 --> 04:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
chair the market can't solve the problem
 
04:55:21.628 --> 04:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
if it's already built and it doesn't
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
work thank
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
Damon I just want to note that vehicles
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
that require full-size parking spaces
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
are not the only mode of Transit that
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
people people might use and while it
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
frankly didn't occur to me in a timely
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
manner I wish we had a statement about
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
at least
 
04:55:43.788 --> 04:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
encouraging bicycle
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
storage smaller Vehicles pedestrian
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
walkways Etc and I just need to put that
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
out there in the universe motorcycles
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all of which take much less
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
space than
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
cars represent
 
04:56:00.030 --> 04:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
makoni uh Mr chairman could we uh move
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
the question we can't move the question
 
04:56:04.510 --> 04:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
but I think I think we're finished up
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um all those in favor of the
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%

uh it they changed the format

um that was part of of the original bill
 
05:00:08.190 --> 05:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
or an earlier amendment I can't remember
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
which and it was intended to work with
 
05:00:13.990 --> 05:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
something else that has changed it no
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
longer really works um the objective
 
05:00:18.360 --> 05:00:20.548 align:start position:0%
longer really works um the objective
being

05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:00:20.558 --> 05:00:22.868 align:start position:0%
being
to

05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh direct those uh decisions that are
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
made by local building
 
05:00:33.750 --> 05:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
officials uh and it gets appealed if if
 
05:00:35.788 --> 05:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
there's not a local building code board
 
05:00:35.798 --> 05:00:36.510 align:start position:0%
there's not a local building code board
of

05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
appeals then send it straight to the
 
05:00:43.150 --> 05:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
State Building Code review board um
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
because in the absence of a uh local
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
building code board of
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
appeals typically the Zoning Board of
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment serves as the local building
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
code board of appeals and they do not
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to be making
 
05:01:00.548 --> 05:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
decisions on appeals of building
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
building code decisions uh
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
the State Board certainly
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
does specialized local bodies that
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
properly established as the building
 
05:01:14.110 --> 05:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
code board of appeals do typically have
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
that expertise but the zba sitting as
 
05:01:18.830 --> 05:01:18.840 align:start position:0%

05:13:58.110 --> 05:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
opposed that was in favor right okay all
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
right we're unanimous on
 
05:14:02.670 --> 05:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
that um okay so any discussion on the
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
underlying bill as
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
amended I'm
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
H 1065 thank you so much yep regarding
 
05:14:17.280 --> 05:14:18.548 align:start position:0%
H 1065 thank you so much yep regarding
fire

05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
fire
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
sprinklers so I think this is an
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
important bill um we had um some public
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that some cities and towns
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
require more stringent than State Fire
 
05:14:33.150 --> 05:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
code regarding residential sprinkler
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
systems I think that's really important
 
05:14:36.750 --> 05:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
that we make it clear that they cannot
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
be more stringent than the state fire
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
code I think that is part of the process
 
05:14:42.548 --> 05:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
of of of what's been holding up some of
 
05:14:44.910 --> 05:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
this development and expansion of um
 
05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
units from buildings of two two units to
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
buildings of
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
four representative Reed I agree it's
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
very important and also it was raised to
 
05:14:56.830 --> 05:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
me since adus are my favorite topic
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
these days um that a a person owning a
 
05:15:02.910 --> 05:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
home that wishes to maybe add an Adu
 
05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
within or separate their home into an
 
05:15:08.830 --> 05:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
Adu uh or two or more even if it was
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
allowed might be prevented because of
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
the sprinklers uh by a town so I think
 
05:15:14.910 --> 05:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's very important and especially as
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.990 --> 05:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
Vella um thank you Mr chair um
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
I am not a super big
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
fan of the language in the first
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph um I think
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
that for it uh existing buildings um or
 
05:15:46.990 --> 05:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
existing buildings with no more than
 
05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
four dwelling units and then I think the
 
05:15:52.030 --> 05:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
after purposes it should just be a
 
05:15:52.040 --> 05:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
after purposes it should just be a
period

05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
I understand that it's not it it's
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
not in any way
 
05:16:06.910 --> 05:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
diminishing the overall intent and I
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
feel like you know Clarity in the law is
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
a value but it's it's also not not um
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's not harming the overall impact and
 
05:16:20.548 --> 05:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
I feel like
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
the addition of 17 through
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
19 uh on this bill is far outweighs any
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
negative uh uh from the language uh
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
qualms I have with the first paragraph
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
because I do think that
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
um or I am aware of at least one
 
05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
personal person that was consider one
 
05:16:50.350 --> 05:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
person I knew that was
 
05:16:50.360 --> 05:16:51.948 align:start position:0%
person I knew that was
considering

05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
considering
 
05:16:51.958 --> 05:16:53.948 align:start position:0%
considering
um

05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:53.958 --> 05:16:55.788 align:start position:0%
um
having

05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh two unit structure converted into a
 
05:17:05.628 --> 05:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
three unit structure for renting and
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
found and was
 
05:17:09.000 --> 05:17:11.430 align:start position:0%
found and was
specifically

05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh disheartened that they would need to
 
05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh do the
 
05:17:21.150 --> 05:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
sprinklers and so the project just never
 
05:17:23.788 --> 05:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
got anywhere close to off the ground
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
because of that immense
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
expense and so um you know one less unit
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
because of this and um that or one or
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
two less units because of this that I am
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
directly aware of from from someone
 
05:17:43.270 --> 05:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's providing housing in the state
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
right now um and that
 
05:17:51.990 --> 05:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
is um you know a big deal and I'm glad
 
05:17:55.470 --> 05:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
that the state is taking some some
 
05:18:00.190 --> 05:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
action on that and I do worry that um
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
even though someone in the in the te
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimony in in this um testimony on
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
this Bill said that that you know
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities won't be making these
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances because it's in the
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty we have evidence that they
 
05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
do and I don't agree that they you know
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
ha have uh more experts at the local
 
05:18:28.548 --> 05:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
minicipal that we have access to at the
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
at the state level as far as health and
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
safety uh is concerned and
 
05:18:36.548 --> 05:18:36.558 align:start position:0%
so um for that reason I don't I think
 
05:18:38.430 --> 05:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
they're kind of out of their depth if
 
05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
they go into this and say like no we
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
know better than you as far as as far as
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
sprinklers um and so uh for that reason
 
05:18:49.548 --> 05:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be supporting this this
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh I just wanted to say
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
that I find the language in the
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to be comprehensible and uh it
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
does something that I think uh will be
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
important for um increas in units which
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
we obviously need and for those reasons
 
05:19:13.390 --> 05:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh I do support
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
it representative Walsh thank you Mr
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
chair I'm going to support this um but
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
but and I may have missed the hearing on
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
this because I've been unfortunately
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
double booked the authority having
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction ahjs it's called is a
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
separate section of the code so in spite
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
of this language is there anything
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to stop an ahj from doing
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
what he wants regardless what's
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
ah just a question to throw out there
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
again i' I've gone down this road before
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
and as soon as long as the ahj is part
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
of the fire code anything we pass is
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
very difficult to actually adopt so
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
we'll give it a shot wish us
 
05:20:02.110 --> 05:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
well representative Damon
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you two things I'm sorry I'm not
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with the acronym what are you
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
referring to represent W it's called
 
05:20:09.628 --> 05:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
it's in the it's in the uh NFPA 1 it's
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
called The Authority having jurisdiction
 
05:20:13.628 --> 05:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
which is basically the chief or design
 
05:20:16.030 --> 05:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
in every municipality I'm sorry I did
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
not articulate and the way it's
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
described is you know they basically
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
have sole authority to based on
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances have the final
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
word represent D go ahead the other
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%

05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
as a committee we technically have four
 
05:22:01.390 --> 05:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
bills left there's one Senate bill that
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
we've received that I plan on hearing
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
after crossover um there's other
 
05:22:07.390 --> 05:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
chairman on the committee that have
 
05:22:08.708 --> 05:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
advised me that that's probably the
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so we don't have
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
redundant meeting dates um and then the
 
05:22:15.230 --> 05:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
other three is the one by representative
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
Wallace HB 1215 which we're going to get
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
an amendment on and then we have um HB
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
1291 um which we've put a lot of
 
05:22:25.990 --> 05:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
discussion in I want to give everybody
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
enough time to digest that and then HB
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
1399 um there's an amend m m that
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams passed around
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee today that I'd like
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
everybody to take a look at and um be
 
05:22:41.470 --> 05:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
prepared to discuss um next Friday
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
during our work session so I'm going to
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
notice a work session next Friday
 
05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
starting at 10: and then an executive
 
05:22:48.510 --> 05:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
session to follow that and that
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be the last day that
 
05:22:50.830 --> 05:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
we'll get all the bills out of our
 
05:22:53.350 --> 05:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Walsh yeah
 
05:22:55.390 --> 05:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah when I
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
suggested maybe waiting till have the
 
05:22:58.270 --> 05:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
crossover that was with the Assumption
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
we were done all our business but seeing
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
us out we are coming here anyway for
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
other bills if you wanted to roll the
 
05:23:06.910 --> 05:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
dice and and do the Senate bill as well
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
we may not get anything after crossover
 
05:23:11.788 --> 05:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
so just something for you to think about
 
05:23:14.430 --> 05:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
okay the only reason I hold usually
 
05:23:16.990 --> 05:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
until crossover is if I get eight bills
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
from the Senate before I hear them and
 
05:23:20.948 --> 05:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
exec them and then after cross over they
 
05:23:22.590 --> 05:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
give me one more that that's all I was
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get yeah I I I think there's
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
other bills in the Senate that I'd like
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
to see at least come to this committee
 
05:23:30.510 --> 05:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to hold off on those
 
05:23:30.520 --> 05:23:32.190 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to hold off on those
anything

05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
