introduce okay you
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you um I'm Katherine saus I'm
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
um division 7 and it's which is also
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh w s um I apolog iiz for my
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
speaking I had a stroke um a couple of
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
years ago and so sometimes I have word
 
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.990 align:start position:0%
years ago and so sometimes I have word
finding

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
finding
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties so um now this cacr is
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
you're probably asking yourself why now
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
why is this bill why is this cacr in
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
front of you and what I want to say it's
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
for the people that are not represented
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
house the division of church and state
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
has become
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
blurred blurred blurred blurred in the
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
last four or five years and what I would
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
like it on the record that I am a devout
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
Greek Orthodox and so I am a Christian
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
but I I do not believe in the Christian
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
imposition onto public policy at all and
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
um I also function as a nurse and so uh
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
there is sacred space between a doctor
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
and his patient and I don't I don't
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
believe anybody it has the right to be
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and um there's a lot of Christians
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
non-christians in um New Hampshire and
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
nsha is a welcoming city that has a
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
mosque we have Hindus we have a lot of
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
different religions and the fact that
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
Faith groups are are um using their tax
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
exempt status to
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
reach I mean yeah they're they they get
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
to reach too many people and they have
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
too much political power and in a state
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
that runs as lean as ours that means
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
that when things are taken away from the
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
public to take to religious um
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
organizations to to uh determine public
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
policy Than People of different um Faith
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
or even atheists do not have the same
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
crack at the pie to
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
me because from the beginning of time
 
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
here the founding fathers have started
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
they started with the Treaty of Tripoli
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
to say about the separation of church
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
and state and as we grew up I remember
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
hearing about Roger Williams and I
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
remember hearing about the Pennsylvania
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
how they were quite firm about how they
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want churches and church and
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
state mixed together so part of this
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
goes into the
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
um into the part where um it said in our
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
um the money in the constitu of the
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
state would not go to religious
 
00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
state would not go to religious
schools

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
so I have people in my ward especially
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
and it it really bothers me because we
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
have an elementary school that has
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
between 80 and 90% of the poverty-driven
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
children uh qualifying for free and
 
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.829 align:start position:0%
children uh qualifying for free and
reduced

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
meals and
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
um at the polls and at other times when
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
we have meetings up at that school
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
people who are of the
 
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
um The Homeschool cow crowd and the ones
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
who want the public school vouchers tell
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
all the parents um this is a nasty
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
school it's a failing school and I want
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
you to know where you can get free
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
money and you can take your children out
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
of this this failing school and that
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
hurts me right in my heart because one
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that the founding fathers
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
did was say that everybody has access to
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
an adequate public education and so
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
when um you're taking money out of a um
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
public school to put into a private
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
school and it doesn't come back then
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
those people who don't have that same
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
power um are under represented by all of
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
us and so these are the reasons why I
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
want wanted to have this cacr because
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
not because I
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
don't understand and um respect what
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
faith-based groups do in the state of
 
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.190 align:start position:0%
faith-based groups do in the state of
New

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I just want people to stay
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
in their own sandbox and stay in their
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
Lane stop dividing us up and um let's
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
all get along for the people that we
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
were elected to
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
represent and so it goes with bodily
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
autonomy it goes with access to
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
education there's a whole group of
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
people out there in this state that are
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
not being represented and that's my
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you questions
 
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.109 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you questions
representative

00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
plet yes thank you for taking my
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
question represents solitis if I
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
pronounced it right um or closely enough
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um you say that uh the public
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
schools are not taxable but the church
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
schools should be
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
taxable and the difference is what do
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
you just want to support the public
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
schools no I just think that the one
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
step out from them is where the the
 
00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:17.349 align:start position:0%
step out from them is where the the
public

00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
schools um their parents pay taxes we
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
all pay taxes part of paying
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
taxes taxation is is not
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
theft and um I have heard that since I
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
got here but for me taxation
 
00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
got here but for me taxation
is

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh a sacred thing uh ability for a
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
society to work together and so when
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
people have a tax policy that there
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
should be no tax policy and that certain
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
groups get all the tax
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
breaks then um people are not being
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
represented presented properly and I
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
just think
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to step back a step from
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
the sound bites and for the things that
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
divide us and work together for sound
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
public policy for all and to remember
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of people that don't
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
have represented re res representation
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and that's who this this
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
on I don't quite see how making that
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
religions pay
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
taxes would empower the people in the
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
school and other people like them that
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about on to to to be able
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
to advocate for themselves more but the
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
thing that most troubles me about this
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
is that uh we have a whole system of uh
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
not of nonprofits not paying taxes some
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the nonprofits seem to me a little
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
bit too stretched into things that
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
aren't helping anybody except the people
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
in it but we do have that and you're
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
carving out just the religious
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
ones and what where does that leave the
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
others thank you for the question I've
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
thought of you specifically a lot
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative Aly since um I um one of
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
your fan girls and I watch how you um
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
have run this committee when you've been
 
00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:56.839 align:start position:0%
the chair and this is just a
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
start um that will probably go nowhere
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
quick but it's a part of a policy
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
discussion that leads to give and take
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
and to learning more and um I know that
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably what you would say a
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
frivolous um cacr and it's wasting your
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
time and I know that you do a an August
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
amount of work in this committee and um
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
and I deeply respect this committee and
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to disrespect anything and
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
I know that my knowledge of these things
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
is not deep but it's just my feeling
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
that since I've got to conquered um
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
seven years ago that it seems to me that
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
that my people in my district are not
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
being represented here and so this is
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
just an ask that we all consider
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that um people who have words that
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
divide us are very hurtful to people who
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the political power to um
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
speak for
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
themselves representative
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
you representative uh one question for
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
you representative and then Mr chairman
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you uh does this
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
cacr inject other government rules and
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
regulations Beyond Health policy of the
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
churches no it would not Mr chairman uh
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
the question I have then is is the Dr
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to speak on this particular
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
resolution or cacr
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
today um if they if they would like to
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
or you would like them to we I don't
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
have a pin card because my question is
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
directed how much in state revenue would
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
be produced from local and state taxes
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you Mr chair um I I
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
support the general concept of with the
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state but when
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
I start to look at it at a detailed
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
level then I start asking questions like
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's a big private school at the end
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
of um my road that I live on and it's
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
it's goes back like well over a hundred
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
years and it's and it's was started by
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
the Episcopal church if you went there
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
now I I don't they don't even have any
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
you know they make the kids go to Chapel
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
on Sunday morning but um aside from that
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a big property and I'm
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if we're just talking about
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
the house of worship which would be just
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
just the church or um if we're going
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
getting into the things like where it
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
could be a school
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
and when it says um religious
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
organizations um you know that that's
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to Def to find and some
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
things could be go you know they are or
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
they're not and of course if this passed
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen is we would have to
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
develop rsas to answer these questions
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
but I think I would like to have a
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
better understanding of what it would
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
mean in the long
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
run yes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so for hundreds of
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
years it was the churches in similar
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
societal groups that took care of the
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
poor and fed the poor and housed the
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
poor and if we were to tax these
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
institutions a lot of them their door
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
swings both ways so I don't know what
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
you mean exactly by staying in their
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
Lane I mean a lot of churches have
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
rainbow flags on them so do you really
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
want to tax these churches as you call
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
them I I would refer to them as Church
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
buildings if you're a Christian I'm a
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
Christian we're the church not the
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
building right and so are you in a
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
position then to pick up the slack and
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
the enormous resources it's going to
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
take for public schools and public
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
institutions to do the work of these
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
churches as you call
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
them um no sir I'm not what I
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
am is I'm
 
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.470 align:start position:0%
am is I'm
asking

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
the the people who look on the poor and
 
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.069 align:start position:0%
the the people who look on the poor and
unrepresentative

00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
unrepresentative
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
represented is um less than or um making
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
their Church's
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
values reflect on how they feel about
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
people who are not me members of their
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
religion and so the things that the poor
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
have that they consider moral
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
failings and um
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
mostly this is a grand idea that I
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
thought in my head and it's kind of like
 
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.349 align:start position:0%
thought in my head and it's kind of like
not

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh cacr so much as a
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
question follow up
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
please can I finish answering I thought
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
finish no I just think that
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
um the ask that that this body makes of
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
you every two years is to get blood from
 
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.270 align:start position:0%
you every two years is to get blood from
a

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
stone and it's a very hard thing I know
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
it and so what I'm
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
asking because it's um I'm I'm on
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
invironment and agriculture committee
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm stuck in the farms and in cow poop
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
so so for me to have a working knowledge
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
of what it is that you all do and you
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
see the bigger picture than I do this is
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
a question of how we can stop people who
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
have an
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
agenda from looking at other people with
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
the different
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
scope and um punching down on them and
 
00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:18.190 align:start position:0%
scope and um punching down on them and
and

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
example where would we be in this state
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
if the governor of Texas puts a couple
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
of buses up
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
here I don't know but the way that that
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
people who are dividing us as a nation
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
from different points of view I just
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
want it to stop because it's getting in
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
the way of us taking care of everybody
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
else and so if everybody would come here
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
today and listen to this and they would
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
see that I am representing people who
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
are not not represented
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
here and maybe they could tone down
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
their rhetoric a little and we could
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
come together for the good of the people
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that's a big ask
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
and I know that this is probably a big
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
distraction that this committee doesn't
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
need but I'm just asking that this the
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the religious groups have so much
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
political power they have Deep Pockets
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
the money can come from out of States um
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
I myself have been doxed by a religious
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
um organization and I had pictures of my
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
house put on the internet with death
 
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
threats when I made an obscure comment
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
about moms for Liberty I had hate mail
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
from Florida um and I just want people
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
to stop you know if your first
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
reaction is something from your stomach
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
out through your mouth then this this is
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
not not a policy thing it's an emotional
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
thing and I want us to be more like
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
Susan El me and be policy driven let's
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the policy and that's what I
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
want follow up so uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
so you want certain churches to quit
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
beating down on people but the churches
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
are split the churches support the lbgt
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.349 align:start position:0%
are split the churches support the lbgt
community

00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
so which churches are you going to shut
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
down with taxation I mean you're talking
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
about churches beating down not
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
representing people they represent both
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
sides of the fence so which churches do
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
you want to shut down first you want to
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
shut down the LGBT church or do you want
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
to shut down your church or
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
representative Oris let's keep the
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
questioning to the specifics on this
 
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
questioning to the specifics on this
bill

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
please I'm I'm getting off all right
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
um hold on uh yes representative thank
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um regarding uh taxation on
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
churches though it's also covered by the
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
the US Congress too and that might be
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of difficult to allow for taxation
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
of U churches in the Hampshire when
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're against federal laws but um I got
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
to tell you I'm sympathetic with the
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
fact that um last session I put a bill
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
in with Su Prentice
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
to actually do a study committee on uh
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and I live in Plymouth and
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
Plymouth has uh greater than 53% of its
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
of its properties are owned by
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um and we have the majority
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
of Plymouth uh property owners that are
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
basically subsidizing both churches uh
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
schools hospitals
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and I would prefer actually a
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill ultimately to go in that would
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
actually allow for um um municipalities
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
to tax at some percentage every
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to include churches so I am
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with to the extent that
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
churches should not necessarily be
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
exempt thank you I am excuse me
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton is there a
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
question U would you you would you
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
believe that that's the case I would
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
because um in a state that's driven so
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
much by property taxes this was a big
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
year for property taxes to go up and a
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
lot of these buildings
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
um they're sitting on pretty valuable
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
property and I just I I guess I would
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
like for people to go back to where we
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
could uh we could chat on policy and we
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
could be the policy makers and that you
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
know when every dime
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
counts especially my property taxes I
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe it you know and um I
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
think because I'm in a in a in a haze a
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the times because of my spinal
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
cord injury I um I was like wow they
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
really went up and so it's a precious
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
thing the resources that are available
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
in this in this state and every dime
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
counts representative one question I
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
have is I know there's a lot of small
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
churches mine included where we are just
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
barely staying afloat yeah and we we
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
help Community we get calls from people
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
who need help and we help to the extent
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
we can help attacks attacks on on my
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
church and smaller churches pretty much
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
completely puts us out of the business
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
of helping people that's how tight we
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
are and I know a lot of other churches
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
are that tight so I guess what would be
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
your comment on on that scenario because
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of small churches who
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
are are and my church um I think that a
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
lot of churches are not have not even
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
begun to rebuild since covid and uh my
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
church St Philips in Asha is one of
 
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
those two and so this is a tough ask
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
this I know that well I know that this
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
is going to come out of this committee
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
itl I mean I I know when you have the
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
discussion you're going to say she's a
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
fruit cake W nuts her heart's in the
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
right position but it's not going to fly
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
but I am I am am cognizant of that and I
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
know that my church too that I
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
love there's just not the people there
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
like they should be and so yes I'm
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that thank you any other
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
questions on new topics uh not new
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
topics but new questions yes
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
representative Al
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
just yes ma'am uh just real quickly
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about separation of
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
church and state which doesn't exist in
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
the con Constitution what the
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution states is that the state
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
shall not interfere with
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
religion and considering John Marshall's
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
famous quote the power to tax is the
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
power to destroy and mccullock versus
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
Maryland how is this not
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional well representative auy
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
I um I I understand your position and
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
what I have is
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
um I think for
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
every um Court decision that you bring
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
up I can bring up one as well so
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
sorry Roger Williams founder of Rhode
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
Island was the first public official to
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
use this metaphor he opened that an
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
authentic Christian Church should would
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
be possible only if there was the wall
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
or a hedge of separation between the
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
wildness of the world and the garden of
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
the church the most famous use of the
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
metaphor was by Thomas
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
Jefferson um who said there should be a
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
wall of separation between church and
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
state there is
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I just want with citizens
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
united um did a disservice I believe
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
some people did think that it was a
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
lovely thing but I don't think it was a
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
lovely thing at all because it opened a
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
can of worms or even if I use another
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
metaphor uh Pandora's Box and how we
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
have access to to us to the policy
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
makers that's what my question is and
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
and how we are going to how we're going
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
it just okay one quick follow up one
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
quick followup and just uh let everyone
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
know we have three more speakers on this
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
topic thank you you're aware that when
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
Roger Williams wrote his comment he was
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the state interfering with
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
the operation of a separate church
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
because he had escaped from a um
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
established religion in
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and when Thomas Jefferson
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
was writing about the danburry
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut he was defending the right
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
of the danburry Connecticut Baptist
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
Church to be an established church and
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
not have the state interfere with its
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
existence not merging the states
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
together you're aware of that correct
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
yes but it those things in my humble
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and it is a humble opinion is
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that should go both
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
ways that um the churches shouldn't be
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
meddling in the
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
government's stuff it's just just you
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
know you stay in your church you pray
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
and you do what you do you do you and
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
the government will do the government
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
and just because some people can raise a
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
lot of money on the internet to in in
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
influence policy to the detriment of the
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
access of the other people it just it
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for me in my heart and
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to start to have
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
this discussion because I'm hopeful that
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
that we can reach out to one another on
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
a policy level and have good
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
discussions and I I just want to say one
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
more thing clearly this is not a dig or
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
disrespect at any church or their work
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
that they do which I say is
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
marvelous thank
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you for your
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.029 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you for your
testimony

01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
all right next up we have representative
 
01:03:56.839 --> 01:04:01.309 align:start position:0%
all right next up we have representative
Ellen

01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
Reid thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I am sorry I've been running in and
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
out I have five bills just this morning
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
to to testify on and one of them kind of
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
the one I'm kind of bouncing back and
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
forth with you all on kind of intersects
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
with this um so for the record my name
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed I represent uh New Market
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
and new fields and for this discussion I
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
would also like to say I adjunct taught
 
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
um American government for 4 years so I
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
feel like I have a little bit of um a
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a knowledge base on this
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
issue I wanted to address three things
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
that I heard come up I didn't hear the
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
entire discussion I apologize if I am
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
repeating so there was a question about
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
asking the prime sponsor so you feel
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we should tax religious schools but
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
not tax Public Schools I was very
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
confused by that because of course we
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
don't tax tax public institutions
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
they're paid for by taxes that seemed
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
kind of an odd concept um public means
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
the things that we are publicly funding
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
with taxes I think the better analogy is
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
we tax private for profit schools and
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
should we also tax religious schools so
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just address that question
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
also the concept of separation of church
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
and state and how um formative it was
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
for our Founders came up so generally
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
speaking it is considered to exist in
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
our constitution in the form of the
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
First Amendment both The Establishment
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
Clause and the free exercise clause
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
which I will speak to later in more
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
depth but the prime sponsor said that it
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
was her humble opinion that it should go
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
both ways and in fact it's not only her
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
humble opinion it was the opinion of the
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
framers of the Constitution because we
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
have both The Establishment Clause that
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
says the government will not um pass a
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
law regarding religion and the free
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
exercise clause saying that people are
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to practice their religion
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
freely um it already goes both ways and
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
so that's usually what we consider to be
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
the separation of church and state in
 
01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:06.589 align:start position:0%
the separation of church and state in
the

01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution but it was also spoken
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
extensively by the writers of the uh
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Federalist essays so the the concept and
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
these are the framers of our
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
constitution who hit the ground running
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
trying to convince the states of this
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
brand new nation to ratify our
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution and they spoke to this and
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
the reason that they they spoke to this
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
um was because it was out of a sense of
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
hey vote ratify this constitution
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
because this
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
separation um and this is to be fair
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
this was before the first amendment
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
actually the Bill of Rights was passed
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
but this separation this concept this
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
value that we hold will protect you
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
because it's never and this is why the
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm doing on free speech and
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
education right now that I'm bouncing
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
back and forth it is pertinent it's also
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
in that first amendment because it's
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
never the popular opinions that need
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
protecting it's the minority opinions
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's the unpopular opinions that need
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
protecting from the majority so that is
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
separation so I have a a question and I
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
I think it might sound factious but I
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
don't mean it in a factious way and it
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
does actually um ping off of something
 
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
that another representative said you
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
know which churches can can someone and
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
I mean this seriously and I know you
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
can't answer me right now but can
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
someone give me a definition of the
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
difference between say a predatory cult
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
and a religion because right now we have
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
religions that are tax exempt that are
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
based on science fiction writers saying
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
that there's an alien species of
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
microorganism in our blood we have
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
religions tax exempt religions based on
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
flying spaghetti monsters that one is
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
tongue and cheek obviously but there you
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
can come up with what is to prevent
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
someone from coming up with any set of
 
01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
someone from coming up with any set of
ridiculous

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
Notions and then getting tax exempt
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
status while they roll in the the
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
donations and I mean that very seriously
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
how do we legislate that how do we
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislate a genuine faith and we can't
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
because we can't make a law concerning
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
religion because of the the The
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause of the First
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
Amendment so this particular cacr does
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
not infringe on the first amendment in
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
fact it it's quite the opposite because
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
we're saying that even people without
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
faith deserve the protections of the
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
First Amendment so while you don't tax
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
churches currently you would tax a
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
organization and then I think of the
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
primary work of most religious
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
institutions most religious instit
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
institutions I think and I can speak
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
predominantly from um the Christian
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
faith I have a minor in religious
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
studies and Once Upon a Time pursued the
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
path of ordination but that was a long
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
time ago um and for the Christian faith
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
it is often cited that the work of the
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
church is to be the hands of and feet of
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
Christ in the world and so the church
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
and other religious organizations do a
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
lot of good work in the world and I
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
think that is predominantly the basis of
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that we should um give them tax
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
exempt status but like any other private
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
institution if you do charity in the
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
world that the money that goes to that
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
is actually tax exempt so why are we tax
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
exempting the entire organization when
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
we only need to exempt the charitable
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
work and I think that's an actual real
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
function that that could be used to say
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
to make the difference between say a
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
ridiculous kind of cult in an actual
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
faith-based organization that's doing
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
good work is if you tax exempt the
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
actual work you are thereby um
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
rewarding organizations that do good
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
work in in the community and you are
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
kind of penalizing through regular taxes
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not doing that
 
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
work but instead just using it to make
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
profit for
 
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.310 align:start position:0%
profit for
themselves

01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
um and for what it's worth I think we
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
could use some Revenue but
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
having said all that I'm happy to try to
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
answer questions I'm not a co-sponsor on
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I just happen to be in the
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
right place in the right time and and
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about the
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for your testimony uh
 
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.709 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for your testimony uh
any

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative fellows um
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
given your uh experience and background
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
with this I wonder if you can tell us
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
how what the churches were like at the
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
time that the constitution was was
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
signed much much smaller with the
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
exception of the Catholic Church of
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
course right what and what did they
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
do um I would imagine and I'm I wouldn't
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
call myself a historian by any stretch
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
but I would imagine they did a lot of
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
the same charitable work but what they
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
don't what they didn't do and I I grew
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
up in the South where we had mega
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
churches okay and we're talking about
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
multi- hundreds of acres for a
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
particular property and they would
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
fundraise and to put in their fifth
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
elevator and make the building bigger
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
and all and to do more marketing to to
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
get more donations and a lot of the
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
money that went into the church went
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
into that cycle of getting more money
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the pastors of these churches made
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
easily in the six figures and usually in
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
the seven figures so um that's what
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
didn't happen for the most part again
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
the Catholic church has a is a much
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
longer history and was much larger
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
organization but um the uh that the
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
Puritans for example as unpopular as
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
they were and as harsh as as they may
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
have been did not have that kind of
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
today okay thank
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
easy okay next I have and I don't can't
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
quite read this but representative
 
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.510 align:start position:0%
quite read this but representative
Robert

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
Robert
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
correctly and uh actually let me just
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
say uh representative
um

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
saus did I pronounce that correctly um
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
if you could fill out a pink card at
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
please okay yes all right thank you Mr
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable members uh I did not
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
intend to speak but um when my colleague
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
from NASA spoke I I felt compelled to
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
just step up here for a few minutes and
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh address some of the points um first
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
of all I'm horrified that she would ever
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
receive treatment
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
from uh poor treatment and abusive
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
treatment from churches
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a saying that there are both
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
Believers and makeb Believers and those
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
makeb Believers are wol wolves and
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
sheep's clothing and I would you know
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that perhaps those are the type
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
of people who attacked her because that
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
that is certainly not what uh Christian
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
churches should be doing and I'm
 
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
appalled at such
 
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.350 align:start position:0%
appalled at such
behavior

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
behavior
um

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
the concept of the separation of church
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
and state has already been stated and
 
01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
and state has already been stated and
and

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
um discussed I just want to reiterate
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
what my colleague from Hudson also said
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
is that the Constitution prohibits the
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
government overreach and prevents a
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
union between church and
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
state um and and it does it's not a
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
two-way door in fact um just to pull up
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
um significantly just I'm reading from a
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
a passage I or website I looked up real
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
quickly significantly numerous founding
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
fathers in early statements asserted
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
that religious Faith was the most
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
important source of civil virtues this
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
includes John Hancock John Adams
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Rush Thomas Jefferson uh
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
Charles Carroll Catholic from Maryland
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
of course John Witherspoon uh as well as
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution signers George Washington
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Franklin um Abraham Baldwin and
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
Statesmen such as Noah Webster John
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
Quincy Adams and our own Daniel Webster
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
so I can get uh references if anyone
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
should want those um I also want to
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
address that that aspect of
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
um that churches and Moss and synagogues
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
um all of which are in nashille I I
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
myself though representing Hudson I go
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
to a church in n Joshua um New Hampshire
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
is the most unchurched state in the US
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
clearly there is not a huge political
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
power being exerted in this state by the
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
churches moss and
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
synagogues um some of us might wish that
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
were that that were so because of the
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
Civil virtues that I mentioned before
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
but that is not uh the case I
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
believe uh last ly um the
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
churches are funded by people who are
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
already taxed and though they get a
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
benefit of uh deductions from their
 
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.149 align:start position:0%
benefit of uh deductions from their
charitable

01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
contributions um that is a burden that
 
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
contributions um that is a burden that
they

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
bear and those people who are not
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
donating to the church the Pressed uh
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
portion that my colleague from NASA
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um those people receive the
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
community benefit of those relig
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
religious organizations but without the
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
burden of making those
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
donations so I I find this uh proposal
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh something that I could not uh support
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
and I just uh felt compelled to make
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
these few comments thank you for your
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%

you representative for your testimony I
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
was struck by your last comment about uh
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
people in the community getting the
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
benefits of the churches in their
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
community and I would like you to
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
expound on them because I'm not sure
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to so I can't
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
speak for every uh religious
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization but I know for my the own
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
church that I go to we uh reach out in
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
ministries to the community within NASA
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%

dealing with addictions we have other
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
similar types of Ministries that really
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
benefit the Greater Community as a whole
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
and are not intended to be solely
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%

NASA and I've done some research in
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
terms of some of the charitable
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
organizations the homeless services and
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
other kinds of services and I know that
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
some of those organiz ations in addition
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
to providing the services also uh expect
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of religious observance
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
among the people that they're helping
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
and how does that square with your
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
comment that the churches should not
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
be uh forced to pay taxes whe because
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing charitable work when part
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
of the charitable work requires the
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
recipients to be getting
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
proed so so that was not my argument and
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
and so um my argument was that the
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
people who are not being who are not
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
contributing who are not donating to the
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
churches still receive a community
 
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.149 align:start position:0%
churches still receive a community
benefit

01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
and as far as um the
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
prizing I I can't speak for that I I
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
suppose in um the Southern New Hampshire
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
rescue center might do that I I really
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't don't know um but I know at the
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
homeless Ministry that my particular
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
church is involved in there's there's a
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
a brief message but it is not you must
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
come to church it is not you know
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
forcing the these people to do anything
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
and a matter of fact there are people
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
who actually after receiving their food
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
or or materials that will help them get
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
through the times that they're suffering
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um just walk away and they don't they
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't receive that so it's not it's not
 
01:19:02.629 --> 01:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
by compulsion we certainly don't have
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
armed guards forcing people to listen um
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
so if I would not say that it's fully
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
compulsory I think it uh to some degree
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
it uh there's certainly an incentive
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
because they're receiving materials but
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's uh not is not
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's uh not is not
mandatory

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you representative for
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I understand
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
where the other Representatives coming
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
from in terms of you know her question
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
my question to you is is it prizz or is
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
it teaching a man or a woman to fish so
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to feed him every
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
day my experience with Grace Capitol
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
because I helped with that project is
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
they asked people to be there so they
 
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
could train them to fend for themselves
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
if you will or to help themselves lift
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
themselves out of poverty would you
 
01:20:03.159 --> 01:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
themselves out of poverty would you
agree

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
disagree can you
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
clarify thank you I would agree because
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
I think to to to some degree I
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
think a great portion of what people
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
suffer in the world is tied up in their
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
identity of themselves and the one thing
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that uh faith and I think particularly
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
the Christian faith can raise up the
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
identity of the individuals
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
and cause them to know that they are
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
loved and accepted regardless of their
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
conditions that their worth is not based
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
on their contributions to society
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily but is based on an
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
overwhelming love from God and not
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
from um their current status so can it
 
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
change the mindset of those to whom
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
these churches Minister
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely can that mindset then help
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
these people to rise up above their
 
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.910 align:start position:0%
these people to rise up above their
circumstances

01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.510 align:start position:0%
circumstances
absolutely

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
no thank
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more thank you for
 
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.709 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more thank you for
your

01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
testimony all right we have uh two more
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
tibo thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
committee let me pull up my statement um
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
so before I begin with my written
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like to point out that
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm my name is James TBO I'm the
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
chairman of the New Hampshire
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Council which
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
is a statutory Committee of the New
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Legislature under RSA
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
19k and I would point out that that we
 
01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:53.189 align:start position:0%
19k and I would point out that that we
have

01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
um Catholic members myself included
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
Protestant members atheist members um
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
diverse oh absolutely I
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
apologize yeah I understand um but um so
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we have a hold on
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
one second represent what Advisory Board
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislative youth
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
advisory Council RSA 19k um I would
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
point out that we have um a wide variety
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
of religious diversity on our Council
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we all unanimously agreed to
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill in expedient to or
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
this um resolution inexpedient to
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
legislate and that was
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
because we believe that religious um
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
organizations provide a a lot of good
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for their communities um religious
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
expression is one of the most
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of our state and
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
Nation being protected not only by the
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
First Amendment to the Constitution of
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
the United States but also part one
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of The Constitution of the
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire religious
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
organizations engage in a substantial
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
amount of charitable good for our state
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
from hospitals to schools to feeding and
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
clothing people in their time of need
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
and they can only do this because they
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
are exempt from taxes and can instead
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
put that money to good use um this
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment would strip religious
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
organizations of that tax exempt status
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
meaning less income to keep the lights
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
on let alone help the people they strive
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
to assist in a on in a Time where Church
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
attendance is already floundering um
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
churches rely on donations in order to
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
continue offering clerical Services as
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
well as charitable ones and religious
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
Charities tend to be some of the best
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
funded because um um religious people
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of social status have been
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
found to be 25% more likely to donate to
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
charity and poor religious people are
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually far more likely to donate to
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
charity than even rich or middle class
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
um religious people these people
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
typically um donate to their churches or
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
organizations in some way affiliated
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
with their churches because they're
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
expecting that they're going to be able
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
to help as many people as possible with
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
that tithing but that impact would be
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
lessened if those donations were taxed
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
cacr 18 also creates a clear
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
hypocritical and in our view potentially
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional double standard between
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
religious and secular Charities um both
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
can be sources for incredible good yet
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
one would be penalized simply for um um
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
simply because they worship God how is
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
that acceptable in a nation that was
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
founded on the idea that we are endowed
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
by our creator with certain unalienable
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
rights and that we as an American people
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a quote firm Reliance on Divine
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
Providence we believe that it isn't
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
religious organizations would still
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
retain tax exempt status at a federal
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
level um which also shows an anom
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
anomalous disparity that further calls
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment into question if the
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
federal government recognizes the need
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
for a tax exemption on religious
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
organizations why not the state of New
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if it could um further be
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
asked if the government would even be
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
the most effective party using those
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
funds it is often found that private
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
Charities including churches and
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
religious organizations use their money
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
far more responsibly in order to stretch
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
each dollar as much as possible um these
 
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
Charities are actually Limited in how
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
much they are given and would be further
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
limited should this amendment pass this
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
is in stark contrast with government
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
which can simply raise taxes and take
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
the people's money at threat of
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution or go into debt should it
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
want to fund some new welfare scheme or
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
there loaded ineffective program that
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be slower and less responsive to
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of the poor than a private
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
charity would be Unbound by Pages upon
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
pages of Statute in the interest of
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
protecting fundamental constitutional
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
rights to freedom of religious
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
expression ensuring that churches and
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
religious groups can maintain their
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
charitable excellence and allowing for
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
each dollar tithe to a church from
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
congregants young and old alike um to
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
actually go where it's intended rather
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
than into the government's coffers the
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire legislative youth
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
advisory Council pursuing to RSA 19 K3
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1 strongly recommends cacr 18
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
be voted inexpedient to legislate and
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
would further encourage a motion of
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%

members and and I'm
 
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily impressed with the
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
caliber of those students and their
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness so and I so I just want
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that they vote the
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
council unanimously voted okay y thank
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely because we were we
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of IDE ological diversity on
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
the council but we all agreed that
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
religious organizations provide a
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
substantial good for our community and
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
for our state and so we could not see
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
any way in which this would not only be
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
allowed but even more realistically
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
speaking that would even pass with the
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
two-thirds required in the Senate um so
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
that was generally um our our largest
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
concerns okay seeing no more questions
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable we've already talked a little
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
bit it was disc today but if those if
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
that think about in your own communities
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
if that floor if that backbone of your
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
community was gone that Gap that state
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
and local governments would have to make
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
up would be grave and would need to be
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
made up in those areas where state and
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
local governments have an obligation to
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
do that thinking only of Catholic
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
Charities and the six nursing homes that
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
that Catholic Charities provides and the
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
obligation that the government has to
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide and Medicaid support that that's
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
provided I do want to address some of
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised by the
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the public policy issues
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
discussed and I will not hide from that
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
does the Catholic Church oppose abortion
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely does the Catholic Church have
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
a position of uplifting and upholding
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of every human person
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely should representative sophus
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
have been subject to attacks absolutely
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
not because every single person as an
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
human and an innate dignity and respect
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
and that should not have happened to her
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
um at the same time as I've mentioned
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
this the Catholic Church will be here
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
and will be here advocating for the
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
Dignity of every human person from the
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of Life to the end of life and
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
everything in the middle from lifting up
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
every person who is experiencing poverty
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
and every person in between and has the
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
right to do
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
so and we will be here and we will do
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
that but the point that I bring up at
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning that this also has an
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
impact on other religious organizations
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill has a disparate impact because
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
it does not come down upon other
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations so religious
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
organizations who hold these beliefs and
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
hold these positions will be subject to
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
taxation but other nonprofit
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
organizations who come before this body
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
and hold the same positions who come
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
here with the same speech would not be
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation so the only
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
difference is where you worship ship and
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
the religious beliefs that you have
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
would subject you to Taxation and that's
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
do and to give you some examples so
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
while St Joseph Hospital in NASA would
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
be subject to taxation Southern New
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Center would
 
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
not and while St ano college would be
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation Southern New
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University would not and so
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I do agree with the
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor I think this is a tremendous
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for discussion for
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get to know each other to
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
understand the positions that we take
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
and to have begin that dialogue but I do
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose cacr
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
18 thank you thank you representative PL
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes when I was watching you you were ad
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
living a lot but I also saw paper in
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
front of did you have written testimony
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony to submit
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
to you today I did not submit it
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
electronically I will get that to you
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you uh yes
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chair and this
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
question is probably better addressed in
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
a work session but I was a member of a
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
board of a small
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that um was surviving doing
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay and it has recently on the last
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
couple of years its operation has been
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
Charities this this was not a religious
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
organization to begin with but now that
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
it's under the uh board directive of the
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities would that
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofit now also be subjected to uh
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes when where community that
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh are are are Exempted from the
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
um have to pay property taxes now that
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of Catholic Charities yes if
 
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
it were if this if this proposal went
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
forward um the difference from one
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
governance structure to the next uh from
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
one uh from one day to the next would be
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
that under previously it would not be
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation but under Catholic
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
Charities it would be subject to
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
you yes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
so in the last couple years with fuel
 
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
oil prices and energy prices is soaring
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
have you had more requests for help the
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
same or less fuel uh fuel requests have
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
increased that's correct do you have any
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
idea how much uh that I do not have if
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
you would be interested I could obtain
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
that information and how many classes do
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
these people have to take in order to
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
get fuel assistance from the Catholic
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
church so from I would have to obtain
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
that information from you for fuel
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
assistance in our parishes that would
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
vary um the parishes on a parish level
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
um the parishes have discretion to
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
determine how they would um distribute
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
that um on the Catholic CH from Catholic
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
Charities for assistance for the for um
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
the for cath the Catholic Charities
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
model really is about lifting people out
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
of poverty and there are requirements
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
for going through um classes in
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
education to receive assistance are are
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
received by the seniors that have signed
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
up for this
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
program the program is born of the meals
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
on Wheel senior meal delivery program
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
that allows seniors a chance to get out
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
and have a CH choice of a healthy
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
nutritionally designed meal and also
 
01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to socialize and interact
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
with other seniors as well as restaurant
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
guests and
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
employees this program has brought it
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
people together after a time when
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
loneliness and isolation had skyrocketed
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
it allows seniors rather than just
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
getting meals delivered to them the
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get out of what is many
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
times an empty home with a delivery
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
person may be the only person they see
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
and interact with during a
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
day to me and many of the sponsors it
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to Grant State funds to a
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
group or organization and then tax that
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
group when they use those
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
funds when we ran into the Governor at
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
event he told him about the issue and he
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
said get the bill to my desk and I will
 
01:40:25.199 --> 01:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
said get the bill to my desk and I will
sign

01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
sign
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
it this bill has both Republican and
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
Democrats that have signed on in support
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
as well as members from both
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%

disclosure I have one of those cards in

taking my question I'm not familiar with
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
the program but I'm
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
wondering as the program exists now does
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
the restaurant operator or any other
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
private Enterprise have the ability to
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
take a tax exemption for Their
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
donation I do not believe so but he can
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.990 align:start position:0%

Enrique
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman representatives of the
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
speak on this important bill my name is
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
John Eric quzo I'm the president and CEO
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
of Meals on Wheels of Hillsboro County
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh we operate under the older Americans
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
Act and the older Americans act one of
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
the mandates is that we help reduce
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
social isolation and
 
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
loneliness and uh and over the past 50
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
years the way this has been
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
traditionally done is through something
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
called Community dining and Community
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
dining Across the Nation some sometimes
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
looks like serving a meal at a senior
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
center to a group of older adults so
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
socialize and for the better part of 40
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
years this has been a very successful
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
and positive model it's had an impact on
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
on many many older adults throughout the
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
country however over the past 10 years
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
on a national level and a local level
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
we've noticed that participation in
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
traditional Community diet in has been
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
on the decline about 10% declined uh a
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
year over the past 10 years there's been
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
lots of studies as to why this this has
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
occurred and some of the main reasons
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
are uh stigma of going to a senior
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
center uh being told when you have to
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
eat and not having a choice of food and
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
so after doing some uh rigorous research
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh we found that we could although it's
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
never been done in New Hampshire before
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
contract with a restaurant a local
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant to serve those very same
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
meals that our dietician
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
approves uh and uh and that we
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate that
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
participation uh would increase in
 
01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.629 align:start position:0%
participation uh would increase in
community

01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
dieting and we started a pilot funded by
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Meals on Wheels America group
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
through a grant pilot was successful we
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
worked with State of New Hampshire come
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
up with some some guidelines on this
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
that was successful and now we're in
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
Three restaurants in Hillsboro County
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
and it's been a huge success
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
participation has been
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and the stories that we
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
hear about the impact on people uh has
 
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.149 align:start position:0%
hear about the impact on people uh has
been

01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful now here's the the
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
catch the restaurants we pay the
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants using funding that uh is in
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
part provid provided by the older
 
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
Americans act federal government the
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
state and we have to fund raise for the
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
balance we pay that to the restaurant
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
the restaurant has to pay meals tax on
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
that for each meal that equates to be
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
about a buck a buck a meal and if we're
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
if we're producing let's say 30,000
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
meals uh a year on this program that's
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
$30,000 that is being taken out of the
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
program and being sent back to the
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
federal government or to the state
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
government uh in terms of ta meals tax
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh so what this bill proposes is that uh
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
anybody restaurant who's participating
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
under this program is approved by uh the
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of elderly Adult Services
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
could be exempt from paying that tax
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
thereby allowing us to reinvest that
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
money into back into the program so just
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
to give you an example if we're paying a
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant today $13 a meal uh once this
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill passes we will only have to pay
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
them $12 a meal that extra dollar will
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
go back into the program to serve more
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
meals that's my
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you any questions yes
 
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you any questions yes

spilsbury's

01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
question could you answer his question
 
01:45:50.119 --> 01:45:51.709 align:start position:0%
question could you answer his question
about

01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
do they get a tax did you ask a
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
tax representative spillsbury was it a
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
tax what
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
right um if I may ask the question again
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
and I use the word exemption I really
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
meant deduction um it's th this on the
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
surface seems like a good idea to me I'm
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand whether there
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
are any other reciprocal um implications
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
to it is there a tax deduction currently
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
taken by the restaurant or any other
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
entity no thank you for the question
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
this is a very unique situation where we
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
as a nonprofit are paying a for-profit
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant for every meal they serve
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
under this program so no there is no
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
there is no other way to do
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
it it's taxing State funding which is
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
counterproductive representative
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
fellows um thank you I I'm not clear as
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
to whether or not you're represent like
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
the Meals on Wheels program for the
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
whole state or just for your county but
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
e either way can you tell me anything
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
about the number of meals overall and
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
how many are being prepared by like
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
staff at the senior
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
centers versus coming from the
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
restaurants yep and and also it sound
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
like you were saying are people going to
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
the restaurants to get get the food yeah
 
01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
is that wonderful so so why don't they
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
go to the senior center they don't want
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
to so there's been a steady decline in
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
participation on a national and local
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
level in traditional Community dining so
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
just to give you um just to give you a a
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
a snapshot to put in reference in our
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
best year under Community dining
 
01:47:48.910 --> 01:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
traditional Community dining we served
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
12,000 meals on our best
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
year Hillsboro County yeah but but these
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
numbers are similar through through
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
State and National for Hillsboro County
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
12,000 uh we introduced this this dinal
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
club program and we're looking to exceed
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
30,000 meals just for the dout club
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
meaning that it's been much more popular
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
people are participating and yet yes
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
they go to a restaurant they get a card
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
and this card has uh a QR code on it and
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
they present it and they get a separate
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
meal and that meal is a separate menu
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and that menu is approved by
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
our dietician this is what the dout club
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
card looks like and it comes with eight
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
meals a month
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
preloaded so you can get eight meals a
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
month at a local one of those three
 
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.709 align:start position:0%
month at a local one of those three
local

01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh the meal is nutritious
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
meets all the daily requirements put
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
forth as required by the older Americans
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
Act and the biggest thing is people are
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
socializing uh loneliness is killing
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
people and and this is a a pandemic of
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
loneliness the the Surgeon General of
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
the United States last may put out an
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
advisory uh issuing an epidemic mic of
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
loneliness in the United States just
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
this last May uh you are 50 times higher
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
likely to get Alzheimer's or other
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
serious medical conditions as a result
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
of isolation and loneliness this is
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
something that is helping people in real
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
time uh if we could get more funding for
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
this program we could expand the program
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
we'd like to go into some of the more
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
rural towns uh right now we're in
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester we're in uh Pinardville uh
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we are in marac uh we have plans to
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
have one in nashwa and we'd like to go
 
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
out towards the Peterboro area uh and
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
other Meals on Wheels providers have
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
taken an interest in the state now that
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
we've test piloted in doing this program
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
I know there's High
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um the way it had been
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
described to me was that the restaurant
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to provide a meal to the people
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
who would show up on a particular day of
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
the week uh in which case they're
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
socializing but if I show up or
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative PL shows up with his card
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
and um just sits at a table by himself
 
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
and eats his
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
meal um is that
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
socializing showing up is 99% of the job
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
you're not you're getting more
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%

01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
trip to that
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant people are pulling tables
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%

the way for the cars representative
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%

01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh residents to in my over 55 community
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
but when I do go out it's six of
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
us thank you uh representative fellows
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
um yes so the ply the senior center in
 
01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
Plymouth has congregate meals and
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
anybody can go and you're not you're not
 
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
required to pay for it they don't ask
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
you anything about your income and um a
 
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people do make donations though
 
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
because there are people they feel you
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
know they could they can they can afford
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
the food but they want to go to the
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
center and before covid they you know
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get together with other people
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I have two parts of the question I I
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
didn't hear an answer to what you your
 
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
response about did they have to go on a
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
certain time in day or could they just
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
go wherever they wanted whenever they
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to the restaurant and they could
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
take other people with them they could
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
take their grandkids whatever or um
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
and or and also is there an income limit
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
on who gets the card thank you for the
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
question let me start with the income
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
limit this is the the the congregate d
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
program uh the same congregate dining
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
program as you'd see in a senior center
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
there's no income requirement as and
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's how it was designed through the
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
older Americans act so we don't ask what
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
your income is uh and uh the we don't
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
ask for money we suggest a donation of
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
$4 a meal we have a donation box at each
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant where people can drop in a
 
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.750 align:start position:0%
restaurant where people can drop in a
few

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
few
 
01:53:51.629 --> 01:53:51.639 align:start position:0%
bucks about half the people
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
donate which is
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
fine uh as far as when you can go that's
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
up to the restaurants uh right now most
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the restaurants you can go pretty
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
much anytime some of them will say well
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
you can only go between you know uh when
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
we open at 11:30 till 5:30 great you
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
know uh but our experience is is that
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
most times people they'll accept the
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
card does that answer your
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:22.030 align:start position:0%
card does that answer your
question

01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Aly
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think well maybe Grafton county
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
is especially struggling with this
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
because we have a really strong Senior
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
Center on uh group around the entire
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
County uh
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
but you saying you're saying that you
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
are not getting that kind of
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
participation in any other county in the
 
01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
state no I'm saying how many how big is
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
this program going to get and who pays
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
for it sure I'm saying that it is a
 
01:54:58.639 --> 01:55:00.149 align:start position:0%
for it sure I'm saying that it is a
national

01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
national
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that we've experienced as
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
well in the state I mean we we have five
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels of Hillsboro County has
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
five traditional congregate dining
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
centers uh throughout Hillsboro County
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
that you know you might get a dozen
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
people 12 people 15 people but we also
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
have other community dining experiences
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
that are less traditional uh and and so
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
we need to attract more
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
people so I would say that what you're
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
seeing right now today in 10 years you
 
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
won't see it you'll see a big reduction
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
because that's the
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
question representative fellows um yes
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
just for additional information so the
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
traditional Meals on Wheels where where
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
a meal is delivered to somebody's home
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
are these coming from restaurants or or
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
how are those being prepared well let
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I wanted to say there
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
was a a question an additional part of
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
your question that I didn't answer which
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
is how big will it get um and who's
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
funding it uh we get
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 2third of our funding from
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government in the State and
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
the other third we have to raise which
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
is over a million dollars a year uh how
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
big can it get it it'll get as big as
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
people are willing to donate and state
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the federal government are willing
 
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:30.750 align:start position:0%
and the federal government are willing
to

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
fund uh so Meals on Wheels traditional
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels is most of our business
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh in comparison to community dining or
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
congregate dining or the D out club uh
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
those are all about this big meals on
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
wheels traditional Meals on Wheels
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
delivering at home is about this big
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a major part of what we do um
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's going strong uh we continue and I
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
think from meeting with the other Meals
 
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
on Wheels providers just on uh Monday I
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you that they've all said that
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
strong yes so my question was the ones
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
that are that go out delivered by car to
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
the people are those coming from
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
prepared by restaurants or if not how
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
are those prepared not that I know of
 
01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
for me it's it's coming from a
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
caterer some a caterer in other words
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
somebody uh produces the meals Mass
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
produces the meals because we have to we
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
have to deliver uh about 7,000 meals
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
every week uh there are some Meals on
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
Wheels providers we use
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh on a limited basis to
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
deliver some meals to community dining
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
sites there are some Meals on Wheels
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
providers that cook their own
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
food um I'm not aware of any that use
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%

proposal

02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%

02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh will these um
 
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh restaurants be audited every year
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
program um representative that's a very
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
good question currently uh because this
 
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
is a a
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
new well the the voucher program we
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
currently do not have an audit program
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
specifically um geared just for the for
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
the voucher program not that I'm aware
 
02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.589 align:start position:0%
the voucher program not that I'm aware
of

02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
now I I have a question is would this be
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
a is this a difficulty for Dr
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
to um I mean in G does it affect your
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
software or your ability
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
to to figure out whether the right
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
amount of tax is being put in where some
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
taxed I believe that the um for the
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
administration of this tax we need to
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
have the information uh when the The
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
Operators submit their um M and M&amp;R
 
02:01:30.669 --> 02:01:30.679 align:start position:0%
return to the Dr uh we'll probably have
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
to um redesign the form to accommodate
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
that um that capability to allow the uh
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R operator to report such information
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and um I I believe that is to the
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
extent that uh that any kind of
 
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
challenge uh would would be you know I
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't expect it to go any further than
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
that the other thing that we might have
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
a concern was um when we were discussing
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
this was whether what uh the patrons who
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this program um if
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
they were to
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
be um I guess if they they were to
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
purchase meals that were specifically
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
within the program and and meals that
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
were outside the program and how is that
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
going to be um managed because only the
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
meals that would be uh within the
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
program would be exempt whereas the
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
meals that is not uh will not be exempt
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then uh will the operator be able to
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
bifurcate their billing process and
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
therefore report it uh correctly to the
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
Dr okay so if I'm understanding you
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
correctly from a Dr perspective it's a
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
change to a form it shouldn't be that
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
costly for you to do that but on the
 
02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.510 align:start position:0%
costly for you to do that but on the
operator

02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
operator
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
side there's some question as to what
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
has to happen uh that is correct because
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're not familiar with how the
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
operators are currently managing that
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
process um and if they and if um if
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are such a situation I'm not sure
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
um I believe that um participants in
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
this uh in the voucher program from what
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've read through um through research
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
is that the the meals are very specific
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
and they're only out of a certain manual
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
or something like that and um but will
 
02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
the patrons who come will they be able
 
02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
to order out of this menu and all of
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
that menu I'm not really sure and then
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be how's that that
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
purchase going to be to to take take
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
effect okay John I'll call you up in a
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
minute we'll let Dr
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
finish um any other question yes
 
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative spilburg thank you Mr
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um Keen in your uh fiscal uh
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
note quick
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
guide the fourth paragraph says current
 
02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R tax law treats certain meals as not
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxable meals under RSA 78
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
a6c and includes an exception quote in
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
accordance with federal law meals
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
purchased with nutrition assistance
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
benefits issued pursuant to a program
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
that prohibits the assessment of aate
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
tax close quote so I want to make sure I
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
understand that is that
 
02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:23.719 align:start position:0%
saying that under current M&amp;R law there
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
already is a carveout that makes these
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
meals not subject to M&amp;R or is the
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
exception that's being referred to there
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
an exception to the treatment as not
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
taxable what is that
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
saying so that specifically is referring
 
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
to let's say if the federal law itself
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
has some kind of provision that says
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
that okay this the meals that's provided
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
through this law shall be exempt from
 
02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
state taxes then then that would apply
 
02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
well and so does that lead to the last
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
sentence there the OAA does not appear
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
to have an explicit prohibition
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
therefore you're saying it is subject to
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
tax corre under current law and that's
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
why the bill the proponents want the
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill that is correct okay thank you okay
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative Aly did you have a
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
question I have question microphone
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
microphone are we going to hear from the
 
02:05:28.109 --> 02:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Human S Health and Human
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
Services from from the section that
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
deals with this program
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
because um they're the only ones that
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
can give us information about where the
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
funding is coming
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
from well we can certainly have a work
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
session and do that I don't know if uh I
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a card from Health and Human
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
Services here today they're really hard
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
to get representative PL I want to make
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
a statement when I've gone for uh one of
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
these meals uh they run the card so
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's their proof when they submit a
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill to the state to get reimbursed so
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
the question there was questions about
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
auditing that is the proof that's the
 
02:06:13.229 --> 02:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
audit they can't inflate the numbers to
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
try to avoid meals tax and any other
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
meal and just full disclosure I can
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
afford the meal so I pay to the state
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
the entire cost of the meal not
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
including the tip because I believe the
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant okay so um based on what
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative PL just said does that
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
imply that the state
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
already or or is the state KN doing
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
anything I'm I'm a little confused as to
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
who's if they're scanning this
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
card who's how's that working or is
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:49.109 align:start position:0%
card who's how's that working or is
that

02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
I mean that that if they're scanning the
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
card the restaurant is not charging the
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax right
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
now okay well we we'll get back to we'll
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
get back to you in a minute then all
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
right uh representative fellows um yeah
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the N the
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
estimates that you made of number of
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
meals where did that come from because I
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of people at this in this
 
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
room like are hearing about this for the
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
first time and saying like oh maybe I
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
can go down and get a car you
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
know so those estimates came from Health
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
and Human Services we were not um given
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
information on the contract agencies and
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
the number of meals per year but they
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
they performed a similar analysis that
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:43.719 align:start position:0%
information okay any other questions
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
John for the record John Eric quzo Meals
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
on Wheels
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
again so the card you present the card
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
it's often completely different menu you
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
get a separate menu you present the card
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the menu each item has a number they
 
02:08:15.549 --> 02:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
scan the card it tells the restaurant
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
your name and how many meals you're
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
qualified for and they put in the number
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
tells us which meal they had so we know
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
what you ate by the way um and then that
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
goes directly into the restaurant's
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
database they have it we have it it's
 
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's immediate billing and at every week
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
I get a summary from each restaurant of
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
how many people ate and here's how much
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
you owe me we compare that to our
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
database and then we pay it and then and
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
based off that billing we build the
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
state under congregate dining and that's
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
how that works so you have a triple
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
check for an audit you have the State
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
numbers our numbers and the restaurants
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
numbers so when you build a state you're
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
also billing the state for the rooms and
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
meals tax portion of that yeah we're
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
passing it on to the state because
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's what uh that's that's in the cost
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the meal it's built in just seems
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that we would have to do that
 
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was a good
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
clarification does anyone else have
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes uh from what
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about popularity not
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
knowing anything about the other eight
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
counties on this could balloon out of
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
our budget if
 
02:09:42.639 --> 02:09:44.830 align:start position:0%
our budget if
we

02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and I would really not like to pass
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill without getting information
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
from the Health and Human Services
 
02:09:57.790 --> 02:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
Division they didn't even bother to talk
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to LBA they sent it to Dr to include and
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's just about the first two
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
places um
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
and on it is very difficult to get them
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
to this committee un to the dedicated
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
fund committee
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh and you have um an in with them
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could get them to be willing
 
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
to show up to talk to us about how much
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
of this is federal funding and how much
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
of it is local and is the federal
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
funding capped and all that kind of
 
02:10:40.109 --> 02:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
thing we'll reach out to them
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
representative Aly um work session and
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
let me just reiterate this only goes
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
this only gets as big as the funding
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
will allow it and right now it's capped
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
and it will be capped before this bill's
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
passed it will be capped after this bill
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
is pass what is the cap right now we
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
well we we're under contract
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for uh Community dining for
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
59,000 units
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
25,000 units meaning meals 25,000 we
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
have set aside just for the ding out
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
club anything we do above that I I have
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
to fund raise 100% for that meal okay so
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
so it is capped at this time so it's not
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
like we really need to worry about it
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing out of
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
control I have under I'm under contract
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
with the state of New Hampshire for
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County for
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
59,000 Community or congregate dining
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
meals a
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
year out of that
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
59,000 I have set aside
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
25,000 just for the din out club now I
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
can use those interchangeably as it
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
stands now we're going to far exceed
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
that but I'm staying within that
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
59,000 meals that we've been given every
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
year for the past I don't know how many
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
years so you're not actually asking for
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
an increase here you're just asking for
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that if the state would take
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
away the M&amp;R tax it would give you the
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
ability to provide a few more meals
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100% okay yes representative
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
this I'll ask this as a question but
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh isn't it true kind of question
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
that I think follows on the point just
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
made by representative
 
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
janigian um isn't it true
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
that the risk to the state of loss of
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
tax dollars only relates to what you're
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
currently paying so that's what the Dr
 
02:12:59.709 --> 02:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
has figured for us and you haven't seen
 
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
those numbers but going
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
forward if your program expands that's
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
great but what we're giving up is maybe
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
future additional revenues coming in if
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
the tax continue to apply but we don't
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
have those revenues right now we're not
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
giving up anything that we currently
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
have except what we've been receiving in
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
the past for these limited number of
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
meals that you're currently providing is
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah you wouldn't have had
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
these revenues if we hadn't develop this
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
program and now we're getting these
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
revenues a discrete amount but no we're
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we're going to give those up if we
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
pass this bill going forward but we're
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
not not giving up anything else we're
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
giving up the prospect of getting more
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
if you expand the program
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
but that's not giving up something we
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
have in hand what you're doing is you're
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
contributing to a program that is
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
keeping our older population healthy
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
engaged and out of nursing homes that's
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
doing thank you oh I'm sorry one more
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
question representative fellow I just I
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
had two questions is this a the money's
 
02:14:20.549 --> 02:14:20.559 align:start position:0%
most of this money is Flowing down from
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government without that so
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
let me finish please you know so I'm
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
wondering is this a pilot program in
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
which case it might be terminated and
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to know like what other
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants in your
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
area this is um
 
02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
approximately I'm going to get the
 
02:14:43.229 --> 02:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
number slightly wrong but let's say it's
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
30% from the federal government 30% from
 
02:14:48.910 --> 02:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
the state and the
 
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
other 40% I've got a fund raise for
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the money is coming down
 
02:14:56.350 --> 02:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
and and maybe there's like 2%
 
02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:57.589 align:start position:0%
and and maybe there's like 2%
participant

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
participant
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
donations um the other question you had
 
02:15:04.589 --> 02:15:04.599 align:start position:0%
was where are the
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants my my question was is this a
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
federal pilot program or is it is it
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
cemented right in statute that this is
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to continue and what were the
 
02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants yeah it's in statute they
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't mention restaurant voucher but
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
we're what we're following to the tea is
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%

02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
Americans act for congregate dining uh
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
whether you do it at a senior center or
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
a local restaurant as long as we follow
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
the rules we're following the rules it
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
was a pilot for the State of New
 
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh which we have already
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
completed and now there are um uh
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines in place it's an accepted and
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
adopted program by The Bureau and um and

gtown uh there is the um village eery in
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%

them

02:16:20.830 --> 02:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so you
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned it would keep people out of
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
the nursing home
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
how isolation and loneliness has uh
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
gives will you there's a 50 times
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
greater chance that you'll develop
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's or other serious illness as
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
a result isolation loneliness this has
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
by far been the most effective program
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the state to help reduce isolation
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
and loneliness for our older population
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%

John has come up with I want you to also
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
understand that it takes a lot of work
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
to set it up it's not something just
 
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
boom like other uh parts of the state
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
are trying to do the same thing but
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
they're learning from what John has
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
succeeded on and it's a lot of work to
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
it for example I brought a letter today

voting procedures for the legislative
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%

board the town or city may also consider
 
02:26:01.269 --> 02:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
resending its action in the same manner
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
as described in voting to adopt
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
it so here with us today we have people
 
02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
that have traveled a long distance the
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
selectman and the police chief from the
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
town of Conway and so um I offer to
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
abbreviate my introduction to open the
 
02:26:20.269 --> 02:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
floor to their expert testimony thank
 
02:26:24.429 --> 02:26:24.439 align:start position:0%

02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
any representative PL is there any
 
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
amount specified in the bill is it not
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
capped could they it is I did not put
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
the amount in the bill I that could be
 
02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
added later as an amendment but the um
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is to Grant the
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities the authority to
 
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:44.710 align:start position:0%
municipalities the authority to
to

02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
um the authority to
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
um address this
 
02:26:53.710 --> 02:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
assessment so one step at a time is the
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
way I kind of looked at
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
it if if if if the committee
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
um authorizes the municipalities to to
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
adopt this
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
assessment then we can also add an
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendment onto it with a dollar amount
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh the committee can add the am the the
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
dollar amount or committee can leave the
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill the way it is and let the municipal
 
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
just add the dollar amount to
 
02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.030 align:start position:0%
just add the dollar amount to
it

02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative fellows I had
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
two classes questions and this is just
 
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
about at the the town level I I don't
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
know what a public safety
 
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
assessment is if is that a tax or is
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
that somebody visiting the place in like
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
a um public sa like a safety inspection
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
and the other question is why is it
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to a capital reserve
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
account okay so first of the first thing
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
is or
 
02:27:59.710 --> 02:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
this it's going to a capital reserve
 
02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
account because it's not part of the
 
02:28:01.479 --> 02:28:03.150 align:start position:0%
account because it's not part of the
general

02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
fund was a a way to separate this money
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
because this money is needed for um tour
 
02:28:16.349 --> 02:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
for for expenses for for tourism and and
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
what was the second first question um is
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
it just a tax or is it some kind of
 
02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.830 align:start position:0%
it just a tax or is it some kind of
inspection

02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
02:28:29.309 --> 02:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
no it's a it's a it's an a it's a
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's like it's like a
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
fee because it's it's to it basically
 
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
going to go to um police and fire
 
02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
because those are the things that are
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the expenses that go up with the
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:52.630 align:start position:0%
that the expenses that go up with the
tourism

02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes thank you Mr
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um just looking at this line
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
eight nine and 10 um I know you said
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's the intent was tourism but the way
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it I'm thinking maybe
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities could use this to maybe
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
augment their welfare budgets I know in
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
in you know okay as we as we talk about
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
transient welfare budgets are really
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
taking a hit
 
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
um uh other special Revenue fund could
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
could could could could this be used to
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
supplement or bolster uh the strained
 
02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
welfare budgets of our towns well no
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
because that's why it's not part of the
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
general fund for those specific reasons
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
and I if if you're looking at the in the
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill line number five and number six is
 
02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
really the heart of this bill the
 
02:29:48.429 --> 02:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
legislative body of a municipality may
 
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
vote to collect a public safety
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
assessment based
 
02:29:55.469 --> 02:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
on each occupancy of each from each
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
hotel that that's really the heart of
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill and but but what you just
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
questioned about using the money for
 
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
something else that's that's why it gets
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
put into a separate account account not
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
fund yes
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
fund yes
represent

02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative however I
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
direct your attention to line nine or
 
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
other special Revenue
 
02:30:29.309 --> 02:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
fund oh well that was the what to title
 
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean what to title the
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
fund it's a special Revenue fund because
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
of just what the representative just
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
asked the question it can't be used for
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
anything else else no no no what what
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
this says is that shall be deposited in
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve fund or other special
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund as may be authorized by the
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the municipality so
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
in short it's not a fee it's a tax
 
02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
because you're collecting a tax given to
 
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
the community to use any way they feel
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
like uh well the intent was to try and
 
02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
not have that happen so I mean we're
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.319 --> 02:31:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
approach chairman members of the
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Delan mccan
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
again uh happy to be here I've shared
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
some written testimony just going to add
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
a few points to that in the interest of
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
time um we are known uh as the city of
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
the open door we're incredibly proud of
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
that in Portsmouth uh we were proud of
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
all the folks that that come to our city
 
02:32:08.910 --> 02:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
and you know if this was earlier in the
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
day I'm sure I could have convinced a
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
couple of you to come out here as any
 
02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
mayor uh should take any opportunity to
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
talk about all the great restaurants
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
wants things to do in their city um but
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm here to talk about really
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of of keeping that that door
 
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
open um and although we're proud it
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of money uh to keep that
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
keep the Chism uh coming in in terms of
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
fire trucks ladder trucks I mean you
 
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
know the amount a ladder truck cost to
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
be able to service a four to five story
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
Hotel you know it's not what a a typical
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
city or town uh is looking for a town
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
that is 23,000 that swells to the amount
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
of 100,000 has to have a police force uh
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're going through a process right now
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
in Portsmith of building or modifying
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
our existing uh police force and and the
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
questions are you know why do we need uh
 
02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
as many police as we do uh in the city
 
02:33:08.429 --> 02:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
and that's frankly because we grow to
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
about a 100,000 a times during the
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
summer and we need a police force that
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know um that's able to accommodate
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh all of that uh and do that safely you
 
02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
know we need to invest uh in the fire
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
and police to make sure that all of
 
02:33:26.429 --> 02:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
these good things uh continue uh to
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
happen and we want these you know we
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
understand the rooms and meals revenue
 
02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a great benefit uh to the state
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
we collect over $30 million we receive
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
less than $2 million back because it's
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
based on population uh and we get that
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know we we wish that it was based on
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
population when it came to the county
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
tax it's assessed on us it's not it's
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
based on our our property values there
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but we understand we're a big part of
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and we are
 
02:33:54.670 --> 02:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
willing to pull on the same rope as the
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the state we know that we're a
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
Frugal State uh but what we're asking
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
for and this bill asks for uh is the
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
right to to to have a little home rule
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes uh to this to be able
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
to self-determined that this is in the
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
best interest of the city of Portsmouth
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day you know I've
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
been up here I think this is my fifth
 
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
year testifying in some form or the
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
other on a bill that is somewhat like
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
this and I'm really excited because I
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
think this Bill gets it right where
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
others have have failed previously this
 
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
was line to tourism fund to Market um
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and and market a business in the
 
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
tourism of a of a locality you know the
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
businesses should be doing that um you
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
know before it would go into the general
 
02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
fund and I think there was some
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh you know what would that be
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
used for and it could be used to grow
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
other things that are not specifically
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
focused on this and I'm speaking on
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of this bill because what I
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of the bill is doing
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
and if there's amendments to to follow
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
that's up to you know all of you smart
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
people here today um it is so that we
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
can provide the things that the city has
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
to provide the number one reason we have
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
government and that's the public health
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
and safety of our citizens that is
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
strained uh by tourism um and it's borne
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
by the taxpayer a property tax that a
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh can't afford even if they appreciate
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
the Vitality that it brings so happy to
 
02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh and I appreciate
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
your time here today thank you
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative PL first question that
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
comes to mind is isn't all that tourism
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
and transience boosting your property
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
tax values for the hotels and the
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
restaurants who benefit from that
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
traffic is so to repeat your question is
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
this captured in the property tax as it
 
02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
stands today no um and the reason I
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's captured in the
 
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
property tax is that we have no ability
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
to look at a a business's revenues of
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
that so we make General assumtions um on
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
this in terms of the assessor's office
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know if we had a um you know if
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
we had a line by line of every you know
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
all the revenues that a uh that a hotel
 
02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
makes we might more accurately reflect
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
that in a property tax but we have to
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
use the highest and best use of that
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
property and so I don't believe that we
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
can accurately depict how much uh this
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
Ames uh good afternoon afterno um so the
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
bill there's this sort of blank space in
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
this bill and also in your testimony the
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill would authorize the legislative
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
body of of Portsmouth to vote to collect
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
a public safety assessment on each
 
02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy the room occupancy at the
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
hotel um that's it so what's the
 
02:37:01.469 --> 02:37:01.479 align:start position:0%
assessment going to be it
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't it gives you a blank check so to
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
speak you can assess at 10% of the room
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
rate or 100% really there's nothing
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
there's no limit set here other than I
 
02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
suppose your good judgment but another
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
municipality's good judgment might be
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
quite different shouldn't there be
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
something there and what should there be
 
02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
certainly would support any language
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
that your good judgment uh would provide
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh on on this um you know I don't think
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
that you know we we govern at the
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
consent of the Govern you know if we put
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
forth a you know an unreasonable tax or
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
levy on the hotels then or fee whatever
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
we're calling it um it seems like you
 
02:37:47.309 --> 02:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
know if we like it we call it a tax if
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
we don't like it we call you know we
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
like it we call it a fee if we don't
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
like it we call it a tax but you know
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys decide what I would
 
02:37:55.389 --> 02:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
like you decide is that it's within the
 
02:37:58.349 --> 02:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
realm of a municipality to say we can
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
assess what the state allows us to
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
assess for the cost born uh by this
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
hotel and I would certainly support and
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
I would up here you know uh cheering you
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
on if you said this is reasonable at
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
this amount um could certainly support
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
something along uh those
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
lines okay thank you I think we're going
 
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
to have to work on
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
that yes represent it's hard to see
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mayor taking my question um it
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
does seem like we'll have a work session
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
and for me I know the Portsmouth area
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
very well I think it would be helpful to
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
have some Ram hers actually from you
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
about what type of funds you feel you
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
need to raise and again whether it would
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
be better um to have a percent or just
 
02:38:45.309 --> 02:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
so much per room night um you know on
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
the flly it's tough to think you know
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
per Center room I I want to make sure
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
you know uh I understand you know
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith you know might be different
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
than another part of the state um and so
 
02:38:59.950 --> 02:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be um uh you know
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
prejudicing the support of other parts
 
02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
of the state when the average you know a
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
hotel night would be you know 250 bucks
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh in Portsmith um versus another part
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the state where it might be less and
 
02:39:13.150 --> 02:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
so a a stock dollar amount might be
 
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
different um than another part but I'm
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
happy to give us context yeah and I'm
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
happy to uh to come back here and um uh
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
and bring uh some more of the folks on
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
our side that could give you more of
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
that data uh that might be more
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
helpful I think to that point are
 
02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
you experiencing a shortfall for law
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement or fire uh prevention is is
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
there a certain amount and I think you
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to answer that
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
right now but excuse me excuse me as
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
part of the representative's question
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
that is going to help us kind of
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
understand what so I I think when we
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
look at the budget of the city of
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
portsman it's about $138 million of that
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh 111 is operating um and you know
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
police accounts for 13 million fire is
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
11 million you know uh schools obviously
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
about half as it is with most uh
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then govern General
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
government's about 23 million um what we
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
found is that we were not competitive in
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
the last uh 3 years we had not ever lost
 
02:40:21.550 --> 02:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
a a hire to somewhere another
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
municipality until last year uh we had
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
to have a you know hard look in terms of
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining police officers
 
02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
I believe very much in our police and
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
fire force I think you know all the nice
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
things we get to do government uh are
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
because we have we keep the the public
 
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
safety uh the public health uh at the
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
Forefront of that um and so we had to
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
increase wages there we're also going
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
through um you know a an assessment of
 
02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
our current police station you know a
 
02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
capital project is not something that I
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
think this would be uh designed uh to to
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
to offset um but here's what I'm trying
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
to solve I guess at the highest level um
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
many people come up to me uh and just
 
02:41:04.110 --> 02:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
wonder why do we have to have so many
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
cops um and I know the answer because
 
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
like yourselves you know I sit and I
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
look at data all day long and I and I
 
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
see uh the uh the need uh for the police
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
because I see the growth in our
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
community um that's really hard for
 
02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
somebody that's living on a fixed income
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
that sees their property values go up
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
but don't want to sell their house and
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
and move uh and then they're going to be
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
paying a a greater and greater share of
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
taxes that's ultimately what I would
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
like to uh decouple a little bit and
 
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's the growth and popularity of
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
Tourism with having people uh be forced
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
to to to move out of our community and
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
taking with them all of the history that
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
they have of Portsmouth of an older
 
02:41:47.710 --> 02:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth a different Portsmouth uh
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
that you know doesn't make the papers as
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
much but you know is built by uh the
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
Navy Yard the Air Force Base uh and
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's what um we're trying to solve
 
02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
we're doing in you know different ways
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of creating you know what
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
you've allowed for the senior and
 
02:42:04.349 --> 02:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
disabled tax exemptions we've increased
 
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
those to larger Parts than anywhere in
 
02:42:08.269 --> 02:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
the State uh but this would help us
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
align the tourm the state which we
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
believe is a beneficial to the entire
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
State um and the people of Portsmith
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
that don't always think of New Hampshire
 
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
when they think of their finances uh as
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
we do uh in the city of Portsmouth
 
02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:27.550 align:start position:0%
we do uh in the city of Portsmouth
okay

02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
others yes representative fellows um I I
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
know this bill has shown up before I I
 
02:42:36.030 --> 02:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
think one time I heard it in um
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County and I'm just
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
wondering um and I don't have the rsas
 
02:42:45.389 --> 02:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
with me but I'm not clear about what
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
what sorts of establishment this would
 
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
apply to it says on line six it applies
 
02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.870 align:start position:0%
apply to it says on line six it applies
to

02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
hotels do you know does it apply to I
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
think you're GNA find and so um you know
 
02:43:05.230 --> 02:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
I I claim to be smart enough to know
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
what I don't know um and I don't know
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
all of the intricacies of the bill and
 
02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave that to your good
 
02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
judgment in terms of doing the work of a
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and and crafting this in the
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
narrowest terms of legislation that
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
allows the greatest benefit the highest
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know points of this I think making
 
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
sure that that hotels and you could
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
limit that in terms of number of people
 
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
that that you know stay in that room uh
 
02:43:31.389 --> 02:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
to cut out uh the smaller airbnbs that
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
might not be able to uh to to pay uh
 
02:43:37.469 --> 02:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
this you could you know again you know
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
capture the the amount or percentage all
 
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
of those things what what I'm here to to
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
support is the state that there is a
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
cost that's not borne uh by uh the
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
property tax when it comes to assessing
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings that engage in in
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
hotels and that this would better
 
02:43:58.389 --> 02:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
capture that cost and allow us uh to
 
02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
continue to provide the services that
 
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
possible yes representative sodi thank
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question have you
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
explored other options like um
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
potentially an auxiliary voluntary fire
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
department and police force Maybe it's
 
02:44:18.830 --> 02:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
also help serves a farm club like in
 
02:44:20.269 --> 02:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
baseball like because you're going up
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
the ranks in order to um well deal with
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the your problem that your safety issues
 
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
that you're speaking of yep so um there
 
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
are uh some of our our our neighboring
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh communities have um more volunteer
 
02:44:38.269 --> 02:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
they they've some of them have moved
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
away uh from that I think it um you know
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
for the number of sworn offers that we
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
have in in in ports it would it would I
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
think it's closer to 78 it would be
 
02:44:54.429 --> 02:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
tough to find that in a um in a uh in a
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer capacity um you know uh from a
 
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh and you know from the fire uh a lot
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
of it is uh you know certainly you know
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith burned down three times not on
 
02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
my watch you know was a couple hundred
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
years ago when we built things in Wood
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
um but uh a lot of what we're seeing um
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
right now is the response to the uh you
 
02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of opioid um EMS visits and
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
we have relationships with neighboring
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
towns uh to provide EMS Services uh for
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
those neighboring towns uh as well um I
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
think it would be a you know while I'm
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
always looking for um you know saving
 
02:45:40.269 --> 02:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
money uh that's big part of the job I
 
02:45:42.269 --> 02:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
don't think it's feasible to operate the
 
02:45:45.150 --> 02:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth's police and fire uh
 
02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer force uh certainly now um
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
and in the summer when we're about
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
100,000 people uh we need trained people
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
that are going to be able to respond to
 
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%

manager uh thank you again and thank you
 
02:47:48.910 --> 02:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
for um powering through my last name as
 
02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
well as lunch can't be easy when we're
 
02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
all low blood
 
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
all low blood
sugar

02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
sugar
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
um like the uh city of Portsmith the
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
town of Conway would like you to support
 
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um as you know uh Resort and
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
destination communities place a
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionate burden on the taxpayer
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
as you know our tax system uh here in
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not allow for
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
different r commercial and residential
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
and we just cannot address you know
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
02:48:22.990 --> 02:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
expenses um later you'll hear from our
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
police chief you know lots of folks
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
consider Conway a small uh northern town
 
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
yet uh if you look at our police force
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
um it Rivals much bigger communities and
 
02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's a necessity because of
 
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
visitorship we're talking about hotels
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
today and you know lodging facilities um
 
02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
the development potentially spurred by
 
02:48:47.550 --> 02:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has been unprecedented I
 
02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
have been the in service for the town of
 
02:48:52.830 --> 02:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
Conway for these last 33
 
02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
years um prior to being the deputy Town
 
02:48:58.510 --> 02:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
manager I was both the town's engineer
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
and director of Public
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
Works um so we're talking about safety
 
02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the disproportionate
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
B burden placed on our uh police and our
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
fire but for a moment I'd also like to
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
talk about a different kind of safety
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
and health uh which is our sewage
 
02:49:14.319 --> 02:49:16.670 align:start position:0%
and health uh which is our sewage
treatment

02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
plant we have a biological
 
02:49:22.269 --> 02:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
process right there are organisms there
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
are colonies of organisms that live in
 
02:49:27.150 --> 02:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
our process that
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
consume the sewage and make it safe to
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
discharge that needs to be balanced with
 
02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
discharge that needs to be balanced with
our

02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:49:37.229 --> 02:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
flows in the last three years Conway has
 
02:49:39.070 --> 02:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
permitted through our planning board
 
02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
five hotels that's 500 new rooms in
 
02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.710 align:start position:0%
five hotels that's 500 new rooms in
three

02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:46.229 align:start position:0%
three
years

02:49:46.229 --> 02:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:49:49.309 --> 02:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
50% of our tax bills go out of area we
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
have entire neighborhoods that are
 
02:49:53.309 --> 02:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
vacant Monday through
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
Friday we're struggling to manage the
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
flows that Peak every weekend that Peak
 
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
during Christmas Vacation due to the ski
 
02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
crowd in February and that peak in July
 
02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:08.269 align:start position:0%
crowd in February and that peak in July
and

02:50:08.269 --> 02:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
August there are Technologies to help us
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
retrofit our
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
plant they're in the Millions
 
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
we as as the um mayor from portsman said
 
02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
we can't capture these costs through
 
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
connection fees through impact initial
 
02:50:28.830 --> 02:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
taxation we urge you to support this
 
02:50:34.349 --> 02:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your
 
02:50:36.750 --> 02:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
PL what's presented to us so far is a
 
02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:40.429 align:start position:0%
PL what's presented to us so far is a
blank

02:50:40.429 --> 02:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
blank
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
check is there
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
a evidence excuse me me examples from
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
other states how this is done that we
 
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
could use as a
 
02:50:55.469 --> 02:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
to why it was presented with your
 
02:51:02.229 --> 02:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
request for your input and your good
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
judgment to determine what's tolerable I
 
02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
understand that similar bills have been
 
02:51:09.870 --> 02:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
before this body in the past and and
 
02:51:11.550 --> 02:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
didn't pass and perhaps it was because
 
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the amounts I can say that you know
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
know as an advert skier um I do travel
 
02:51:20.590 --> 02:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
across the United States to other Resort
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
towns uh and I can see that there is you
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
know a
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
percentage you see nods going up and
 
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
down I understood that there was a a
 
02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
blank amount or initially discussed uh
 
02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
and that a percentage of that would go
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the uh inke Keepers the lodging
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
properties for their troubles um I I
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
guess I assume it's because they wanted
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
input from this body and they they were
 
02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that it would go on uh you know
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
to an amendment and further
 
02:51:57.070 --> 02:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
spillsbury thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:52:04.750 --> 02:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
let's just assume we enact the law
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
exactly as it's been drafted so you now
 
02:52:10.269 --> 02:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
have the blank check as an administrator
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
making a proposal
 
02:52:15.429 --> 02:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
locally what is your proposal
 
02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question um locally
 
02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's been talked about as uh $2 a room
 
02:52:26.510 --> 02:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
night with um between 10 and 20% of that
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.590 --> 02:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
establishment thank you oh okay thank
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative fellows thank
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairperson um so actually
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
that that was like part part of my my
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
question and that's answered but I'm
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
wondering when you you have a lot of
 
02:52:57.469 --> 02:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
those airbnbs up in Conway so how how
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
would they be taxed per room or per
 
02:53:00.399 --> 02:53:02.349 align:start position:0%
would they be taxed per room or per
bedroom

02:53:02.349 --> 02:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
bedroom
 
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
or um
 
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
per per night of rental per the
 
02:53:12.229 --> 02:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
property so if I rented an Airbnb for
 
02:53:17.389 --> 02:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
Friday Saturday and Sunday um under the
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
amount we just talked about that would
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
that would be $6 it's three nights one
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
property whether you
 
02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
again there's discussion sliding scales
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
this one sleeps 16 this one sleeps
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
four um you know keeping things simple
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh walking before we run and again
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
although I don't know because I'm not
 
02:53:46.910 --> 02:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
the spons sponsor of the bill um I
 
02:53:48.830 --> 02:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
assume the reason it was presented that
 
02:53:54.229 --> 02:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
way is for the input of this this
 
02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
body representative ores thank you Mr
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
so at $2 a room a night how much money
 
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
year so we've calculated between uh
 
02:54:13.439 --> 02:54:15.229 align:start position:0%
year so we've calculated between uh
airbnbs

02:54:15.229 --> 02:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
airbnbs
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
um hotel motel um b&amp;bs roughly 3,000
 
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
rooms and the um the work that's been
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
done in Conway though it's not too a
 
02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
science it's roughly 50% occupancy year
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
round because you do have some slow
 
02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
times but in the busy times uh in Conway
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
North Conway we're busy at least nine
 
02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
months out of the year so we're we would
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
estimate about 50% which would be about
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
$1,500 excuse me500 rooms times two
 
02:54:52.830 --> 02:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
$3,000 a day you're just slightly under
 
02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
a million
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
dollars that's the estimate for the year
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes sir followup hello so how much money
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
do you need to upgrade your sewage
 
02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:07.429 align:start position:0%
do you need to upgrade your sewage
treatment

02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
systems we just contracted with a
 
02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
consulting firm we went through the
 
02:55:16.349 --> 02:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
usual and customary RS fq process um
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're not to the RFP process yet um but
 
02:55:24.269 --> 02:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's costing us uh we think in the
 
02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
order of
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
$350,000 to do the study in preliminary
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
engineering and very very ROM rough
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
order of
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
magnitude uh we're looking in the
 
02:55:40.110 --> 02:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
vicinity of uh7 to9
 
02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
million we don't know what's going to
 
02:55:44.670 --> 02:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
happen in the future which is is why
 
02:55:47.790 --> 02:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
again having this be
 
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing you know seems to be the best
 
02:55:53.229 --> 02:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
approach to us uh at the the certainly
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
the magnitude that's being proposed here
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the last five minutes uh it seems
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
quite doable and I think someone else
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
asked you know do you have models has
 
02:56:03.870 --> 02:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
this been done elsewhere uh you know I
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
can give you a list as long as my last
 
02:56:09.150 --> 02:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
name which is pretty long I understand
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
um and where this is how it's being
 
02:56:17.550 --> 02:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
handled followup please follow up so if
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
you are going to raise a million dollars
 
02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
and you need much more than that to
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade your sewer system it sounds like
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to still come up way short
 
02:56:27.630 --> 02:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to well of course
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to raise that money through
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
bonding we'll have 20 years to service
 
02:56:34.110 --> 02:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
that debt uh and by the time we get
 
02:56:35.630 --> 02:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
there we'll have new things we'll have
 
02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
to do because of the disproportionate
 
02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know burden that a destination
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
Community places
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
follow follow so the previous mayor
 
02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned opioid so are you in need of
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
funds to handle like tourists coming in
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
drug use additional fire police maybe
 
02:57:00.429 --> 02:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
for that or not our police chief is here
 
02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
and I would prefer to defer to him uh
 
02:57:06.910 --> 02:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
but yes I mean if you you've been to
 
02:57:09.870 --> 02:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
Conway I'm certain and uh there's some
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
shopping there I mean what an idea right
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to come to a place place
 
02:57:18.190 --> 02:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
that has mountains rivers skiing hiking
 
02:57:19.469 --> 02:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
all active
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
Pursuits and if there are certain family
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
members that aren't interested in
 
02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
activity or if the weather's bad let's
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
add the shopping the shoplifting gangs
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
alone that require you know again the
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
police chief will talk about that but
 
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
our our staff in the detective
 
02:57:39.229 --> 02:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
department to say nothing of
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
patrolman is comparable to No One our
 
02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.670 --> 02:57:50.680 align:start position:0%

02:58:15.269 --> 02:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
F good after afternoon Chris mattye I'm
 
02:58:18.590 --> 02:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
a resident of Conway and the chief of
 
02:58:21.630 --> 02:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
Conway so I can tell you um I moved to
 
02:58:24.910 --> 02:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
Conway about 20 years ago um I've been
 
02:58:27.710 --> 02:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the police force for 19 years I've
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
been the police chief for three and a
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
half years and one thing I can tell you
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
is the two gentleman before he had
 
02:58:34.510 --> 02:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
stated the town is nothing like it was
 
02:58:38.830 --> 02:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
when I moved up here 20 years ago um we
 
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
are adding three new hotels within the
 
02:58:42.389 --> 02:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
next year which will be approximately
 
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
350 to 400 beds
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh that brings hotels don't build unless
 
02:58:49.950 --> 02:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
they think they can fill the rooms we
 
02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
have restaurants being built we have uh
 
02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
houses being converted to short-term
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
rentals I have two in my neighborhood
 
02:58:58.670 --> 02:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
now um and I'm not here to discuss any
 
02:59:00.190 --> 02:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
issues with that I have nothing against
 
02:59:02.670 --> 02:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
them and I welcome the vacationers I
 
02:59:04.269 --> 02:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
want them to come up because that's the
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
economy that we've built Our Town up up
 
02:59:08.750 --> 02:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know upon That's the basis of our
 
02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
our community I have two children a 20
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
soon to be 22y old soon to be 14 uh
 
02:59:16.269 --> 02:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
sorry 16-year-old and they will not be
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to live in Conway so I will be
 
02:59:20.429 --> 02:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
moving soon uh when I retire so I can be
 
02:59:21.790 --> 02:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
with them wher they
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
land uh my house in the recent
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
assessment just doubled in in value so
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
my taxes are going up fortunately I can
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
afford my taxes right now but uh I'm
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
seriously concerned we have a serious
 
02:59:35.910 --> 02:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
problem in the town and it's now
 
02:59:39.309 --> 02:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
becoming a crisis where we are taxing
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
people out of the
 
02:59:43.550 --> 02:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
Town um and I contribute to that because
 
02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
I put forth a pretty hefty budget of
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
about $4.6 million a year so let me tell
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
you a little about the police department
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
um we are between 9 and 10,000 residents
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
due to uh based on our census I think
 
02:59:58.950 --> 02:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
the latest census was
 
03:00:02.349 --> 03:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
9700 if we were a town of just 9700 and
 
03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
we were a bedroom community I estimate
 
03:00:06.070 --> 03:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
our police force would be somewhere
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
between 16 and 18 and I get those
 
03:00:10.349 --> 03:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
numbers based on similar towns and I
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
have those towns with between 9 and
 
03:00:15.790 --> 03:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
like other towns that have colleges in
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
them Plymouth for example the the police
 
03:00:22.190 --> 03:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
force is a little bit larger than you
 
03:00:24.269 --> 03:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
would think for a residence of 4,000
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
people uh that Police Department I think
 
03:00:27.870 --> 03:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
is 11 or 12 rightly so because of the
 
03:00:29.950 --> 03:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
amount of people that come through just
 
03:00:32.429 --> 03:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
like with Conway we are not staff for
 
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
9700 people uh we have 23 officers 24
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
full-time sworn officers one acts as a
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so we actually have 23 on the
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
road to include includ myself and
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
lieutenant and I do try to get on the
 
03:00:48.349 --> 03:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
road as much as possible but like I said
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
we'd be somewhere in that vicinity of
 
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 17 officers if we did not
 
03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
have the elastic community that we have
 
03:00:57.309 --> 03:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
On Any Given weekend I shouldn't say
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
weekend from basically July 3rd fourth
 
03:01:01.870 --> 03:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
through the end of August we have
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 30 to 40,000 people in
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
town we are in the Mount Washington
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
Valley so Conway is the epicenter of
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
that so even those that are staying
 
03:01:14.110 --> 03:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
outside of town flock to Conway the town
 
03:01:16.590 --> 03:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
of Conway so that we have a very elastic
 
03:01:18.190 --> 03:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
Community like I stated so our police
 
03:01:19.790 --> 03:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
force is based on that I think what's
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
different about Conway than most other
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
vacation areas such as let's say the
 
03:01:29.309 --> 03:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
cape or um coastal towns in Maine is we
 
03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
like our Our Town manager said we're
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
busy 9 to 10 months out of the year so I
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
had heard when the mayor was up here
 
03:01:36.670 --> 03:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth why don't we have
 
03:01:39.550 --> 03:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
auxiliary or part time we need to keep
 
03:01:42.349 --> 03:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
that Staffing because we're busy about 9
 
03:01:44.830 --> 03:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
to 10 months out of the year
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
um V uh the the winters when we get snow
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get hit again tonight um
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
the that will bring more people in
 
03:01:52.750 --> 03:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the winter through
 
03:01:54.510 --> 03:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
the end of February into March
 
03:01:55.950 --> 03:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
especially on weekends because people
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
will be coming up to ski we have five
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
ski mountains in the area within 40
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
minutes of Conway so again Conway is
 
03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:03.550 align:start position:0%
minutes of Conway so again Conway is
that

03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
epicenter the issue that I have is each
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
year we put forward a budget we try to
 
03:02:11.070 --> 03:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
be as as conscientious as we can to the
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but we do need more staff last
 
03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
year I asked for an additional
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
dispatcher just so you know we have
 
03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
seven dispatchers
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
full-time uh along with our 24 sworn
 
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
personnel we have 35 full-time staff
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
members at the department to include
 
03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:26.510 align:start position:0%
members at the department to include
support

03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
staff I do need a couple more officers
 
03:02:30.510 --> 03:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
but every year when I try to write that
 
03:02:31.950 --> 03:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
in the budget I hesitate because there
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
are other things that we need so I just
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
add a little more to our overtime fund
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
because we have young officers that are
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
willing to work that and it's cheaper to
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
pay the overtime than is to hire new
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel because you're not paying the
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
extra benefits
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you take the extra officers we have
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
you figure 17 to 23 we're talking five
 
03:02:52.590 --> 03:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
to six more officers at an average of
 
03:02:54.990 --> 03:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
about $100,000 an officer when you hire
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
them at 55,000 a year plus Insurance
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
Plus retirement and any other additional
 
03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
benefits so you're looking at a half
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
million to about
 
03:03:06.429 --> 03:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
$600,000 um just in extra Staffing and
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
of course that gets larger as the
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
officers stay on and they get their pay
 
03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
raises each year that goes directly to
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer it's not the taxpayers
 
03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
fault that we have to have that many
 
03:03:18.910 --> 03:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
officers but then again like I said we
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
are a vac vacation community so we
 
03:03:22.510 --> 03:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
welcome them up without them we wouldn't
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't if without the tourist we
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a base of our economy so I
 
03:03:29.550 --> 03:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
think supporting this bill will help
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
greatly in offsetting some of those
 
03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
costs because as I stated we are going
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
to have to add and I'll end with this we
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
have a department that was built 35 36
 
03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
years ago I have asked the taxpayers for
 
03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
about 8 million million do to not only
 
03:03:46.910 --> 03:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
renovate the department we have but to
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
which is about 7500 Square ft the study
 
03:03:52.990 --> 03:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
that we just paid for um states that we
 
03:03:56.510 --> 03:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
need between 50 and 70% more room 50% at
 
03:03:59.309 --> 03:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
the current Staffing up to 70% 25 to 30
 
03:04:02.030 --> 03:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
years out so we now have proposed not
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
only a renovation of our current space
 
03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
but we're asking for an additional 5200
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
Square ft to accommodate the current
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
Staffing as well as the growth that we
 
03:04:13.950 --> 03:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate in the future
 
03:04:15.389 --> 03:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money to ask the
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of Conway to put forth um and
 
03:04:21.550 --> 03:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
with the recent assessments with the
 
03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
difference in the increase in values
 
03:04:25.790 --> 03:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
between residential and Commercial
 
03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to fall on the taxpayers
 
03:04:29.910 --> 03:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be about 80 to $100 more
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the average home a year and that's a
 
03:04:33.790 --> 03:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
lot to ask especially when their taxes
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
have already some of them have doubled
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to support this bill
 
03:04:39.229 --> 03:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
because towns like us towns like
 
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth need this and in Conway like
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
I said we are not just a two or three
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
month a year um increase in our
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
population due to tourism where I can
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
hire four or five six part-time officers
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
Hampton uses that model they have just
 
03:04:56.469 --> 03:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
as many part-time officers as they do I
 
03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
think full-time officers that model
 
03:05:00.510 --> 03:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
works for them because they're busy for
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
about three to four months out of the
 
03:05:04.110 --> 03:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
year that doesn't work for
 
03:05:07.110 --> 03:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
Conway thank you thank
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
chief for coming down um I can relate to
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
a population that swells I'm from
 
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
Littleton and our population goes from
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
5,000 to 20,000 in the course of a day
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
we a lot of the same concerns that
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're hearing we hear too um I've heard
 
03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
from the the the mayor I've heard from
 
03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
you I've heard the intent from the the
 
03:05:32.830 --> 03:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was to for these this to
 
03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities to essentially tax
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
hotels I'm boil it down to that and with
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
that specifically go to Emergency
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
Services police fire ambulance and
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
whatnot and it sounds and I and I we go
 
03:05:51.150 --> 03:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
to Conway a lot and uh I know exactly
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
where what you're talking about are you
 
03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
worried the way the bill is written
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
because I I alluded to this when the
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor introduced it that there
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
maybe opportunity to maybe siphon money
 
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
away from the intent the way the
 
03:06:09.150 --> 03:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is written uh my colleague
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh picked up on the same thing I did
 
03:06:13.229 --> 03:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
there there seems to be some open
 
03:06:16.830 --> 03:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
open-ended verbiage that you know we
 
03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
could make a case that some you know a
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
park is good for you know we need to put
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
money towards a Park which is not a bad
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
thing but the intent is to go to right
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
to where you're you what you need and to
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
support your services so do you think
 
03:06:34.670 --> 03:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
that the the language as is adequately
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
ensures that your needs are going to be
 
03:06:39.309 --> 03:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
met or are there things that we could do
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
to strengthen that well as far as where
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the money is spent I'm going to ask for
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
it and it's up to my um my town
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
officials to to siphon off whatever
 
03:06:49.150 --> 03:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they they deem necessary for
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
the for the police department but um you
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
know I guess I don't really have a
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward answer for that kind of
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
above my pay grade as far as the way
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's written but I would hate to see uh
 
03:07:01.229 --> 03:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
those of you in this room not support it
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
just because we have to work out the
 
03:07:04.229 --> 03:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
fine details I think it's way too
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
important for that um you know I I I I
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
tell a story I know we're stretch for
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
time but I was next door snowblowing my
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors's uh yard the other today and
 
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
her husband just passed and she is on a
 
03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
single income now uh elderly woman and
 
03:07:21.389 --> 03:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
she came over to me and gave me a hug
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
and said I'll support your new police
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
department you need it but I don't know
 
03:07:26.349 --> 03:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
how I can afford it and I think that
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
really wraps up um what I'm trying to
 
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
say here is I think that people we have
 
03:07:32.590 --> 03:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
a phenomenal community that support the
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
police I can only speak for the police
 
03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and I think there are people that want
 
03:07:37.950 --> 03:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
to support what we're trying to do but I
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
think a lot of them were asking too much
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh the the the the other fear
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
that I have is that people like my my
 
03:07:46.990 --> 03:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
children are not going to be able to
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
live in Conway they can't AF I can't
 
03:07:50.670 --> 03:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
afford my home right now if I had to buy
 
03:07:51.630 --> 03:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
it from
 
03:07:54.510 --> 03:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
myself um it's just too expensive and
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
luckily I I I moved in a few years ago
 
03:07:59.389 --> 03:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
so before the rates went up so I think
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is needed and I'm sorry if I didn't
 
03:08:05.590 --> 03:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions yes repres fellows I just
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you if you you know what
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is you're saying
 
03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes are so high a lot of
 
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
people can't afford to live in your town
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
and it and it's certainly not an issue
 
03:08:21.630 --> 03:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
that's only related to Conway so I'm
 
03:08:23.469 --> 03:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have some ideas of why
 
03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes are so high well I can
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that the the amount of second
 
03:08:30.190 --> 03:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
homes that we have in the community uh
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
people are coming up and they they want
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
the homes in Conway and they're willing
 
03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
to spend the money to to purchase them
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
um they're paying in cash a lot of times
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
they might be outbidding people who have
 
03:08:42.269 --> 03:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
to finance and it's paying more and that
 
03:08:43.630 --> 03:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
this is something that's that's happened
 
03:08:45.630 --> 03:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
like you said across the state paying
 
03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
more for houses which has inflated the
 
03:08:50.510 --> 03:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
values I can tell you that I um I lived
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
in fryberg main up to four years ago I
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
moved to Conway so I could hopefully
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
have a shot at this job um and luckily
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
fortunate for me um I did uh get the nod
 
03:09:02.590 --> 03:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
to to take on the Chief's position and I
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
think it's important that I live in
 
03:09:05.309 --> 03:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
Conway I think it's important that I'm a
 
03:09:08.469 --> 03:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer but I can tell you that um four
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
years ago I would not have been able to
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
purchase the house that I live in so
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
like I said the the the value of my
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
house went up 86% in the recent
 
03:09:20.590 --> 03:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
valuation the reason for that um I don't
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
know all the all the all the in ins and
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
outs of there but I never would have
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
thought that three and a half years ago
 
03:09:28.750 --> 03:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
November of 2019 when I moved in my
 
03:09:31.229 --> 03:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
house that my house would be worth 86%
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
more than it is uh than it was then
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:09:47.309 --> 03:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
next up representative
 
03:09:47.319 --> 03:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
next up representative
Edgar

03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
yes we still and I'll just uh say we
 
03:09:58.349 --> 03:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
still have a lot of pin cards to go
 
03:10:00.429 --> 03:10:00.439 align:start position:0%
through so it ask that as you come up
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
think about what hasn't been said and
 
03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:03.670 align:start position:0%
think about what hasn't been said and
try

03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
try
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:24.429 align:start position:0%
 
details

03:10:24.429 --> 03:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:25.950 --> 03:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman in committee
 
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
testimony um I I will make it brief I'll
 
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
cut out most of it has been awful lot
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
said already um again my name is Mike
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh I represent Hampton and this uh
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is is close to me Hampton uh
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
also Str strong L supports this this
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill so I'll just read a few few of the
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
sentences off of the uh of what I have
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
here and um basically it's I want to
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
emphasize it's a a local option and it's
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
a fee it's local option it's not for
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody maybe most of the towns and
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
and cities wouldn't pick up on this uh
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
take the option and it is a fee it's not
 
03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
a tax it's supposed to be going towards
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
the uh basically the users to a certain
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
degree to support that um and I am a
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and I am maybe
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
you you all can help me I'm trying to
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
find trying to find my glasses here but
 
03:11:29.550 --> 03:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh oh there you
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
are thank you
 
03:11:35.710 --> 03:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
um this I want to repeat again that this
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill enables municipalities to enact a
 
03:11:42.510 --> 03:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
local option Hotel occupancy fee um any
 
03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
the Hotel designation as Hotel was was
 
03:11:47.469 --> 03:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
actually originally put in this in some
 
03:11:49.469 --> 03:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
previous bills because it there's
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
specific uh uh definitions for that in
 
03:11:52.439 --> 03:11:54.389 align:start position:0%
specific uh uh definitions for that in
the

03:11:54.389 --> 03:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%

have any idea what that fee should
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
be I I do yeah but it's what had been
 
03:12:35.469 --> 03:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
proposed in the past and it was in uh
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
basically a couple other bills that had
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
been previously submitted one of them
 
03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
was back in uh 2020 uh
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
hb160 but I have a a section here or
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
possible amendment to include some of
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
those limits which is basically would
 
03:12:56.990 --> 03:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been as for before which was $2 in
 
03:12:59.990 --> 03:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy or a certain percentage not to
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:10.269 --> 03:13:10.279 align:start position:0%

03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
Aly I was going representative Susan
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
elme uh city of
 
03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
elme uh city of
Lebanon

03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think I authored one of these
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
bills and we I've been doing this for
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
quite a while and um I am speaking for
 
03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
quite a while and um I am speaking for
the

03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:13:43.229 --> 03:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
non-tourist urban centers I call them
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
Urban hubs some of them are towns some
 
03:13:52.269 --> 03:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
of us are cities uh but on we are the
 
03:13:52.279 --> 03:13:53.790 align:start position:0%
of us are cities uh but on we are the
center

03:13:53.790 --> 03:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
of of uh a lot of towns that are bedroom
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
communities and they have much lower
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes than we do because we
 
03:14:09.070 --> 03:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
provide the social service network we
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
provide uh the shopping we provide the
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
hospital we
 
03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:19.229 align:start position:0%
hospital we
provide

03:14:19.229 --> 03:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:14:23.950 --> 03:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
on on Al we a lot of other things
 
03:14:29.950 --> 03:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
Lebanon is a industrial Hub as well as a
 
03:14:34.269 --> 03:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh has the largest malls in our region
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh and has a lot of startups has a lot
 
03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
of uh nonprofit not tax paying on social
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
services that are used by the entire
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
region uh we have a free transit system
 
03:14:56.910 --> 03:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon provides a fair Lebanon and
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College provide a fair amount
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the cost of that he goes
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
to 15 177 communities in Vermont and New
 
03:15:08.279 --> 03:15:09.950 align:start position:0%
to 15 177 communities in Vermont and New
Hampshire

03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
because of this we have a police force
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
which is twice as large as the police
 
03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
force per capita of any place in Grafton
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
County uh for the same reasons you've
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
been hearing and we have um a fire
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
department which is mostly at this point
 
03:15:38.910 --> 03:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
EMTs uh people responding to Opium
 
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.120 align:start position:0%

03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
the large number growing number of aged
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
people that live in our community but
 
03:15:55.990 --> 03:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
also in the communities around
 
03:15:58.140 --> 03:15:58.150 align:start position:0%
us and
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:59.710 align:start position:0%
us and
[Music]

03:15:59.710 --> 03:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
um we've been trying to figure out for
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
some time within the tax system of New
 
03:16:08.469 --> 03:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on there is almost nothing
 
03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
that a community can do to raise money
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
except the property tax we also get a
 
03:16:19.710 --> 03:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
property tax on cars of residents but
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
not nothing that we can do to raise
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
money from the people coming from
 
03:16:27.790 --> 03:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
outside uh
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the lodging tax which I think it
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
should be called rather than a hotel
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
tax uh is one
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
that does not really affect the people
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the towns living around around us
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
they rarely they
 
03:16:50.670 --> 03:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
will eat in inside the city but we don't
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
get more than our population from the
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
tax uh and they
 
03:17:02.510 --> 03:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and we do get a
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
pilt a a pretty good payment in L of
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
taxes now from from the largest hospital
 
03:17:16.990 --> 03:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
in Northern New England uh which is
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
mostly paying for the extra expenses
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
that they create for us but um we can't
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
charge Pils to a lot of the nonprofits
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
because they um don't have enough money
 
03:17:34.189 --> 03:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
to get their services done as it
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
is so
 
03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:39.510 align:start position:0%
is so
on

03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
WE this is why I've been pushing pushing
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
for this for some time on the college
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
towns have similar kinds of problems but
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
in in fact uh we absorb most of the
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
overload of Dartmouth College in Lebanon
 
03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:18:01.070 --> 03:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hanover doing it uh our property taxes
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
are the highest north of
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh I believe in all of Grafton
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
County so um and this situation occurs I
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
mean Claremont is in this situation also
 
03:18:20.750 --> 03:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh they have been providing less
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
Services usually so so they hadn't quite
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
gotten to this part of the problem yet
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
but but um there are a lot of towns
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
scattered around around the state that
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
are not tourist towns but that are
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
um productive towns that can't figure
 
03:18:46.429 --> 03:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
out how to maintain the services that
 
03:18:46.439 --> 03:18:47.269 align:start position:0%
out how to maintain the services that
they're

03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
providing and that does include sewage
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think sewage is a public
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
safety issue and the public safety issue
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
I think is a large part of of this um
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
the both for emergency health conditions
 
03:19:08.590 --> 03:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
and for and that I suppose could be
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
sewage uh
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
and and the police and the
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
fire so thank you thank you oh and I do
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
think that that it needs a lot of
 
03:19:25.389 --> 03:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
tighter wording in various places okay
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
well we will have a work session on this
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:19:33.870 --> 03:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman representative
 
03:19:38.670 --> 03:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
Al if I may ask a quick question for you
 
03:19:40.510 --> 03:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
and and you you alluded to this right at
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the end of your testimony saying you
 
03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:42.990 align:start position:0%
the end of your testimony saying you
need

03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
work on some of the language if it was
 
03:19:47.790 --> 03:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
to go into effect right now
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh the line on line
 
03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
10 such funds shall be used to augment
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
funding for the cost of Municipal
 
03:19:59.150 --> 03:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
Services associated with the increase in
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
tourism and transient
 
03:20:03.790 --> 03:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
traffic you think right now as that
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
stands would be clear enough that these
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
funds would only be used for that
 
03:20:10.110 --> 03:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of how they're where they're
 
03:20:11.349 --> 03:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
placed and where they we've had the
 
03:20:12.990 --> 03:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
question a couple times this morning and
 
03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to to to bring up
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
well the mechanism that we're looking at
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
would on almost entirely I I put people
 
03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
up occasionally in hotels in in in
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but on because I don't have much
 
03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:20:37.070 --> 03:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
house uh they it it is based mostly on
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
people coming
 
03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
in on that are going to be sleeping
 
03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:43.189 align:start position:0%
in on that are going to be sleeping
there

03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:20:46.349 --> 03:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I think that the
 
03:20:48.990 --> 03:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
transit traffic part it wouldn't even
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
need to say tourism because tourism is
 
03:20:52.239 --> 03:20:53.670 align:start position:0%
need to say tourism because tourism is
transient

03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
transient
 
03:20:56.950 --> 03:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
also uh transient by the way has nothing
 
03:21:00.189 --> 03:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
to do with homeless people in this case
 
03:21:03.309 --> 03:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
it has to do with with you've got
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in from California to
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
something follow up follow up thank you
 
03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
something follow up follow up thank you
more

03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
specifically what I'm getting at is are
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
you concerned at all that these funds
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that are collected would be spent
 
03:21:30.189 --> 03:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that's what I'm trying to
 
03:21:32.349 --> 03:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
yes I think that that it does need a
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
fair amount of definition in a whole
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of areas starting with lodging
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
Hotel okay yes represent both
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you for taking
 
03:21:48.510 --> 03:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
my question um regarding um well I I'm
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
from Plymouth Plymouth is a small town
 
03:21:52.670 --> 03:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
but similar issues than most of the
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
larger towns and I think we have 13
 
03:21:57.150 --> 03:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
police officers by the way not 10 or 12
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
because uh I'm on the select board and
 
03:22:02.349 --> 03:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
it's great to have a full staff but it's
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh kind of like a horror show to try to
 
03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
like fund everything but you said uh
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
similar bills were put in in the past
 
03:22:12.510 --> 03:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
that you may have even uh submitted um
 
03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
what was the outcome of that and is this
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill um perhaps more provides more
 
03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
clarity to how we should proceed on
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
this I think the the there's been
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
a something of a conflict between
 
03:22:35.229 --> 03:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
tourist towns and non-tourist towns that
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
are having identical
 
03:22:37.800 --> 03:22:39.429 align:start position:0%
are having identical
problems

03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:22:44.830 --> 03:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
on and I I would bet that that Portsmith
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
for instance is has a lot more of the
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
features of taking care of people in the
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
outskirts that we have um but uh than
 
03:23:01.630 --> 03:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
they were talking about but um it it has
 
03:23:04.030 --> 03:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
been difficult
 
03:23:08.349 --> 03:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
dividing uh on agreeing on what we were
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
doing each time and and and this bill
 
03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
um is the first of two I think that were
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
put in and the second one bowed out so
 
03:23:24.349 --> 03:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
that the first one could go
 
03:23:29.070 --> 03:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
forward um I do think that
 
03:23:32.429 --> 03:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
um that the problem part of the problem
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
has been that but part of the problem
 
03:23:38.469 --> 03:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
has simply been that
 
03:23:38.479 --> 03:23:40.229 align:start position:0%
has simply been that
um

03:23:40.229 --> 03:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
the um the there are a lot more towns
 
03:23:47.229 --> 03:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
that are bedroom communities in this
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
state than there are towns that receive
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
people during the day Lebanon is up to
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
15,000 population at this point the
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
mayor claims
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
16 uh but on as of 15 years ago they
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
told us that we had about 35,000 during
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
the day I would I would bet give the
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
number of businesses we've got now that
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's more like
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
50 but representative spillsbury thank
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman you've made a very
 
03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
interesting distinction between uh the
 
03:24:29.229 --> 03:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
towns that have this problem because of
 
03:24:33.070 --> 03:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
Tourism primarily versus a town that has
 
03:24:36.269 --> 03:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
this problem for other reasons and you
 
03:24:37.590 --> 03:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
also mentioned Claremont I don't
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
represent Claremont but it's adjacent to
 
03:24:43.750 --> 03:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
charl town and very much affects uh its
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns because like Lebanon
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a shopping Hub um and it's a
 
03:24:53.550 --> 03:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
shopping Hub at a state border in a um
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
sales taxfree state that you know
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
derives an awful lot of its activity
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
from that
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
Advantage Claremont on the other hand
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
has virtually no meaningful lodging
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
activity so if if the if the concept is
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
that we have a
 
03:25:12.189 --> 03:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
problem and it's a shared problem in
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
these different
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
iterations but the solution is to raise
 
03:25:19.950 --> 03:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
it off of lodging what happens to a town
 
03:25:23.309 --> 03:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
that suffers from the burdens of being a
 
03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
regional shopping center and a regional
 
03:25:29.469 --> 03:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
Social Services Center but doesn't have
 
03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
tax this um this is a major defect in
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
our taxation system
 
03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
know I don't know what we I frequently
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what we do about
 
03:25:56.910 --> 03:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
CL it's a conundrum we have sent them
 
03:26:01.070 --> 03:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
some major industry lately okay thank
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.399 --> 03:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
woodcock

03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:16.030 --> 03:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh Representatives I
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
will try to get us back on track um to
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions I hadn't I
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
intended to uh follow up I was only a
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but I just want to get us
 
03:26:27.309 --> 03:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
back two minutes because like you this
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
11:30 meeting is now 1:30 um first off
 
03:26:33.630 --> 03:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
we have question after listening to some
 
03:26:34.830 --> 03:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the dialogue there's an amendment
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's been is needed there's not a
 
03:26:38.189 --> 03:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
question about that at all uh we like to
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
work at that I like to bring you back to
 
03:26:42.750 --> 03:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
how this started with r pres buo and and
 
03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh Paige and I in Conway uh this year
 
03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
with this particular Bill we met with a
 
03:26:50.309 --> 03:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
selectman uh and dialogued with them
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
about these issues uh they seem
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
relatively vague now as you see it in
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
print uh but we wanted specifically a
 
03:26:58.710 --> 03:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
couple things we wanted it to be
 
03:27:01.389 --> 03:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation we did not want it
 
03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be an open blank check for any money
 
03:27:05.950 --> 03:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
coming in as a slush fund what we wanted
 
03:27:07.630 --> 03:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
was a fee in this case we talked about
 
03:27:10.950 --> 03:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
$1 to $2 per night per occupy per room
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
but strictly for health and safety
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
strictly for in a account that was a
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated incumbent account for police
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS and Wastewater the four health
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
and safety pieces for our town which has
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
been extended be and overused and
 
03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
overcharge because of the the tourist
 
03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
Community which we are which is terrific
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
except for these costs can't don't
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
replicate what a town of 8,000 to 10,000
 
03:27:40.110 --> 03:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
people use all right um and we don't get
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
it back any other way so this was the
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
idea of having this fund of uh a night
 
03:27:47.309 --> 03:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
nightly occupancy if the room is
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
occupied for that particular light not
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
to exceed $2 per night um there is some
 
03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
language between lines 20 and 30 to talk
 
03:27:56.670 --> 03:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
about how he did that but that's because
 
03:27:58.750 --> 03:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
it was open to different types of uh
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal structures within the state
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
thinking that a Portsmouth clearly is
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
going to be different from a Hampton and
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
a Lebanon and a Conway each have
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
different forms of government so that's
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
why it's vague we can clearly tighten
 
03:28:10.990 --> 03:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
that up without question and we had
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
talked talked about
 
03:28:15.870 --> 03:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
um you know someone said well why you
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
why you want to assess a a safety fee
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
because it's not like all of us have
 
03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
traveled for usually either business or
 
03:28:24.389 --> 03:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for a funeral or for
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
vacation and we go in and get a room if
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
you look in the website today in North
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
Conway they start about a buck and a
 
03:28:31.229 --> 03:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
half and go to $500 or $600 depending
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
what you want that night at the room we
 
03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
aren't thinking about the extra fee of
 
03:28:37.790 --> 03:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
$12 that's it's disposable income
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
however it's not a disposable cost of
 
03:28:41.550 --> 03:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
the community uh as you heard we had
 
03:28:43.870 --> 03:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
fire we had five this time last year
 
03:28:46.830 --> 03:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
five fire departments two full-time with
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
minimum labor and three volunteer uh
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
supported by uh Chiefs we now have four
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be three before next
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
year comes because we can't afford to
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
supplement the Staffing we need we can't
 
03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
afford to keep the the cost of the fire
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
equipment up we have the police
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
constantly out uh over over tax we don't
 
03:29:06.630 --> 03:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
have enough Police Department once again
 
03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
we can't make that a relative cost based
 
03:29:11.469 --> 03:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
on 10,000 10,000 people on that
 
03:29:14.189 --> 03:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
Community uh the property tax they
 
03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
already talk about and chief M talked
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
about the police pce but we have these
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
are strictly costs that are tourist
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
focused uh and they are Public Safety
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
costs I just want to bring us back down
 
03:29:27.510 --> 03:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
into that uh realm that that was our
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
intent when we started this enabling
 
03:29:32.910 --> 03:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds specifically for health
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
with health and safety uh and and
 
03:29:37.229 --> 03:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
clearly as I see this now it's it's not
 
03:29:42.189 --> 03:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
a out of the out of the uh off the all
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh in that the selectman and
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
the town has been very supportive of
 
03:29:48.070 --> 03:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
this uh as we've gone through the whole
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
process talking about over the months
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as you as you see some of
 
03:29:54.030 --> 03:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
is is is relatively vague in terms of
 
03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
because of I told you the different
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
types of government and the line 10 that
 
03:29:59.189 --> 03:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
someone just brought up a minute ago uh
 
03:30:01.229 --> 03:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
represent is accurate this is this is
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly what it's for it's
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
not for anything else it's not for more
 
03:30:06.750 --> 03:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
Parks more Fields it's just for health
 
03:30:08.830 --> 03:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
and safety because of the cost that that
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we can't we can't absorb and
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
clearly is getting more it's bringing
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's bringing more and more tourists in
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from the time you get down
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth all the way up to CS
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
County um so it's that's what this is
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your concern your
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
consideration we' be happy to work with
 
03:30:26.229 --> 03:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
you on on an amendment I'm sure
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Paige and I would as well
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh to bring this all together to make it
 
03:30:31.550 --> 03:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
easier for your committee I'd be happy
 
03:30:33.189 --> 03:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
to answer questions but I know it's
 
03:30:37.150 --> 03:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
getting late thank you any questions
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
Tibido KY Tibido uh Vice chairman bard
 
03:31:00.630 --> 03:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
of selectman Conway uh pretty much
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
everything that I had on my list has
 
03:31:05.150 --> 03:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
been touched on except for uh one
 
03:31:07.469 --> 03:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
particular item uh first of all I'd like
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
to just go back to the fire and
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh talked with the fire chief yesterday
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
who was unable to make it today the uh
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
fire departments in Conway answered over
 
03:31:22.429 --> 03:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
3,000 calls for service last year in a
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
in a uh a town with a population of uh
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
10,000 people that is a ridiculous
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
amount of of fire service calls at 3,000
 
03:31:36.309 --> 03:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
they're averaging around 10 calls a day
 
03:31:40.189 --> 03:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's because we have 40 uh, and
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes maybe even 50,000 people there
 
03:31:44.349 --> 03:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
at any given time on a weekend or during
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
a busy week okay you've been told all
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
this I won't dwell on it um but I would
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
like to say this much there are is some
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill the hospitality
 
03:31:57.870 --> 03:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
Association I don't see any
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
representation from them here today um
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
has been adamant about opposing this
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill saying that it's going to be
 
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
detrimental to
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
tourism um and as uh representative
 
03:32:11.269 --> 03:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
Woodcock just said any place that he's
 
03:32:13.030 --> 03:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
ever been there's always some kind of a
 
03:32:14.670 --> 03:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
fee attached to the bottom line of the
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
hotel bill state state fee County fee
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
local fee uh no one seems to have any
 
03:32:23.349 --> 03:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
discouragement about any of these uh
 
03:32:25.950 --> 03:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
fees as you travel around the country
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
but more importantly uh I would submit
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
to you that the opposite is actually
 
03:32:34.510 --> 03:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
true it not only won't hurt tourism it
 
03:32:36.750 --> 03:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
is ultimately going to help in the long
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
run because the people that live here
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
and work in the tourist tra cannot
 
03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
afford to stay here they they are being
 
03:32:47.309 --> 03:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
taxed out of their homes you heard the
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
police chief say that he's being taxed
 
03:32:52.030 --> 03:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
out of his home and being a police chief
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
is a good job uh that that's not a uh
 
03:32:58.429 --> 03:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's not a lowincome deal okay so if
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
he can't afford it you can imagine
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on further on down the line
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh the people that live here and work in
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
the tourist trads can't afford to stay
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
here in fact they are leaving and we
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
know this because the resulting new
 
03:33:14.790 --> 03:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
hotels are unable to open existing
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
hotels are operating short staff and
 
03:33:18.630 --> 03:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to get a
 
03:33:20.349 --> 03:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
breakfast or a lunch on a Tuesday or
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because most of the hotel most
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the restaurants in the Mount
 
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley are closed due to
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
short staffing okay uh if the out of
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
control property tax Trend continues
 
03:33:33.189 --> 03:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be nobody left to service the
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
tourist trade so it's important to think
 
03:33:40.189 --> 03:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
about this very carefully and to allow
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
those of us that want to have this fee
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
attached to these rooms to offset some
 
03:33:46.349 --> 03:33:46.359 align:start position:0%
of these costs and ultimately keep our
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
taxes down to something that can be
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
affordable to have this legislation uh
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
if there's nobody left to Ser service
 
03:33:56.429 --> 03:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
the tourist trade where will they go and
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
what will we do because we are totally
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
dependent on them at this point in time
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you any
 
03:34:07.229 --> 03:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you so you mentioned how
 
03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
um housing is unaffordable for for most
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
people that work in Conway and a lot of
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
people who live there now yes so the
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
estimate on what this bill could
 
03:34:29.349 --> 03:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
possibly do for Conway would give you
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a million dollars extra Revenue in
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
a year and that would help a little bit
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
but you don't think that it
 
03:34:40.189 --> 03:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to make housing
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
significant ific L more affordable I
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think and and what do you think
 
03:34:48.510 --> 03:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
might be able to do that that is is uh
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question and this
 
03:34:54.189 --> 03:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
is not the answer okay this is simply
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
one piece to a puzzle that the board of
 
03:34:58.750 --> 03:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
selectman have been working on for quite
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
some time uh we are working in
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the uh planning board
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
whose chair is here tonight I don't know
 
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
if he's going to speak or not um to to
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
work on things uh like uh EXT
 
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
expanding a density requirement so that
 
03:35:15.630 --> 03:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
they can build more houses and a smaller
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
piece of ground uh things of that nature
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're working on the master plan the
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
master plan has a lot of Provisions in
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
there for some form of affordable
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
housing um this is not the beginning the
 
03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
middle and the end this is just a piece
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle that will be very very
 
03:35:34.990 --> 03:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
helpful that will assist in getting us
 
03:35:39.070 --> 03:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
to that end um it's not the answer it's
 
03:35:44.110 --> 03:35:44.120 align:start position:0%

Ben breakfast Association and as a side
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
note as I'm sitting here
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
listening I'm hearing people talking
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
about their their property taxes I will
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
trade my tax bill with anybody I pay
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
over $112,000 in taxes for my
 
03:36:58.269 --> 03:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
property so I'm here to speak against
 
03:36:58.279 --> 03:36:59.269 align:start position:0%
property so I'm here to speak against
hb1

03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
1254 and here we go again I think this
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
is the fifth time I've been down here to
 
03:37:07.469 --> 03:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
speak against this bill my business sits
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the beautiful Newfound Lake Region
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we rely heavily on tourists
 
03:37:13.229 --> 03:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate lodging establishments
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
already collect 8 and half% meals and
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
Rental tax adding another fee to my
 
03:37:19.150 --> 03:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
guests will deter them from staying and
 
03:37:22.349 --> 03:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
reduce my business when I travel nothing
 
03:37:24.189 --> 03:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
frustrates me more than seeing my bill
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
from a lodging facility that includes a
 
03:37:30.429 --> 03:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
city tax occupancy tax state tax and an
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
airport tax if I happen to stay near an
 
03:37:36.429 --> 03:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
airport legitimate lodging businesses
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
are already undermined by Airbnb vrbos
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
and other online book looking companies
 
03:37:43.870 --> 03:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
as well as real estate rental companies
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
who can work outside State Rags will
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
towns be required or able to collect
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
this fee from these online bookings
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
according to their stats they rent a lot
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
of rooms what upsets me the most about
 
03:37:58.269 --> 03:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it is discriminatory
 
03:38:00.990 --> 03:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
and prejudicial why are you only going
 
03:38:02.990 --> 03:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
after lodging why not require
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants gas stations retail shops
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
every business out there and why should
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
my business my life in business be
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for funding towns that are
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
incompetent in their budgeting I see
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
that these revenues collected are
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
intended to be used for Public Safety
 
03:38:21.630 --> 03:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong I'm not against
 
03:38:24.269 --> 03:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
public safety I love my cops I love my
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
firemen my cops have a great dog that
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
comes to visit me every once in a while
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
but why should my business be the only
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
one responsible to help fund this budget
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
line does not everyone benefit from
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Services so you want to
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
tax one business for the benefit of a
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
city's bottom line and I should point
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
out via the meals and rooms tax we uh we
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
already have and are giving money back
 
03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the towns for this purpose and yet
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's a bill later on to reduce this
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
tax and how is this tax going to be
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
enforced does it give the state the
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
right to audit me to make sure I'm
 
03:39:00.510 --> 03:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
giving my town the fee Big Brother's
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
truly watching me and what about admin
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
cost to the town how will they be paid I
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
also see that in order for this bill's
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
requirement to go into effect town will
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
need to vote on it I shudder at this
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
thought particularly with no cap on the
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
fee I know how my people in my town
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
think and they'll they're going to view
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
this as a property tax reduction and
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to get voted in without
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
regard to its long-term
 
03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
consequences this bill is being proposed
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
by larger cities is a money grab for
 
03:39:31.950 --> 03:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
them the amount that small towns could
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
collect is inconsequential town of
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
Bristol two two legitimate lodging
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
facilities two just in the town of
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bristol in the other towns total of
 
03:39:45.070 --> 03:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
three other legitimate lodging
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
facilities around Newfound Lake in fact
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to put an additional burden
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
on me the town and my fellow legitimate
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
lodging Partners to collect and remit
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
yet another tax and fee so on behalf of
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
my of my fellow inke Keepers and on
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of the the New Hampshire lodging
 
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
and Restaurant Association our lodging
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
property members it's a hard no on this
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
and I I want to find and I want to know
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
where are all these
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%

03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
bill this this fee where are they why
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%

from the towns we're not hearing from
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
other lodging facilities that want this
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to truly think about what
 
03:40:30.990 --> 03:40:31.000 align:start position:0%

you thank you representative PL couldn't
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill be POS met if
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
the state gave the rooms and meals tax a
 
03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
bigger cut to the towns and cities
 
03:40:48.189 --> 03:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
that's up to you I totally agree right
 
03:40:50.590 --> 03:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
now I know I know M&amp;R is I know for the
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
$200,000 yes represent ORS thank you Mr
 
03:41:04.389 --> 03:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
chair excuse me thank you for taking my
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
question so if you had mentioned the
 
03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
other Bill about meals and rooms so if
 
03:41:11.309 --> 03:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
that tax was to be reduced is that good
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
you personally
 
03:41:20.550 --> 03:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's you're going to reduce it I guess
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
the the bill that's being
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a bill to reduce yeah to
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
reduce it like in three years from 8 and
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
a half% to
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
6% so what why why not just keep it at 8
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and a half percent why do we need to
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
reduce it down to
 
03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
6% you're getting less money now but yet
 
03:41:42.070 --> 03:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to you want to put another
 
03:41:45.070 --> 03:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
fee on this and if you're allowing the
 
03:41:50.830 --> 03:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
fee how am I go how am I going to
 
03:41:55.149 --> 03:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
explain to my guests then that I had to
 
03:41:57.149 --> 03:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
add an additional
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
10% fee to their bill so we can pay for
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
for um Services out there just keep it
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
at 8 half percent but make sure that
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's being administered correctly back
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
into the towns like I know the 200 Grand
 
03:42:15.030 --> 03:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the town of Bristol gets it just
 
03:42:17.550 --> 03:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
goes onto the general fund and it's used
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
used followup yes followup so reducing
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
the meal and rooms
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
tax doesn't necessarily hurt you but it
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it help your business if that
 
03:42:35.550 --> 03:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
tax was
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
lowered no because it's a pass through
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
people don't get upset about that I mean
 
03:42:43.710 --> 03:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's they're used to seeing that that
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
tax on there so you're saying an
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
additional tax on their bill might be
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
alarming right particularly like I said
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
if you're giving the towns and
 
03:42:57.070 --> 03:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities the power to set that fee
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
they could go anywhere like somebody
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
said a $2 per room per
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
night they could go up but there's no
 
03:43:08.110 --> 03:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
cap on it you could have it $10 10% $100
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
got it thank you very much oh you're
 
03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:12.389 align:start position:0%
got it thank you very much oh you're
welcome

03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
so representative spillsbury thank you
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in an attempt to reconcile
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
those comments and take them one step
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
further what if we combine the concept
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
of reducing the meals and rooms tax in
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
terms of its Statewide
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
application from 8 and a half% take it
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
down by one or
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
2% but then concominant
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
allow local municipalities to sech
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
charge the meals and rooms tax by that
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
one two% so that it would not in any
 
03:43:47.950 --> 03:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
event be higher than the 8 and a half%
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's at now why not just keep it at
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent why do you why
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
do you need an EXT add an extra ST so
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
today as you pointed out all of the
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms go into the general fund
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
but we ear earmark
 
03:44:05.710 --> 03:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
30% for for distribution back to uh
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities those are distributed
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
across the state regardless of where the
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms revenues were generated
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking is if we reduce the
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
rate by one or maybe
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
2% and we then allow a municipality to
 
03:44:25.870 --> 03:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
surcharge using the exact same
 
03:44:28.990 --> 03:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
collection structure statutory
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
scheme um and and make up that
 
03:44:34.189 --> 03:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
difference then it would return it to
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
the town of origin that's the difference
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
so would I be required well how would
 
03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
they enforce that
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
D so am I going to if I if you're going
 
03:44:47.469 --> 03:44:47.479 align:start position:0%
to reduce it say by 2% to 6 and a
 
03:44:49.950 --> 03:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
half% then you want the town to make up
 
03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:50.750 align:start position:0%
half% then you want the town to make up
that

03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
2% how are they going to enforce that on
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
me as the person collecting that tax
 
03:44:57.429 --> 03:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
well these are details we'd have to work
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
out right but just for the sake of
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
discussion assume that uh the Statewide
 
03:45:06.510 --> 03:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
figure is 7 and A2 rather than 8 and A2
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
assume each municipality is given the
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to sech charge up
 
03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:11.790 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to sech charge up
to

03:45:11.790 --> 03:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
1% assume that the state collects it and
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
they manage it the cash flow and they
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
rebate the 1% because they know exactly
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
where it derived from so the records are
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
all there they just simply have to cut a
 
03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
check for the 1% It goes back to the
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
town of origin would would that be
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
workable for the lodging industry again
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
I just think it's unnecessary to have
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
that extra step in there just keep it at
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
8 and a half% and have it as a pass
 
03:45:41.349 --> 03:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
through to to my to my guests that stay
 
03:45:41.359 --> 03:45:42.030 align:start position:0%
through to to my to my guests that stay
with

03:45:42.030 --> 03:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
me what's so hard about that why do why
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
do we need to add that extra step in
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
there okay we'll take this up in the
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
work session yeah that's what I was just
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you okay thank you very
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
you okay next is John colban uh no not
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.349 --> 03:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay the next uh speaker is
 
03:46:31.469 --> 03:46:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
Marvel I am Bill Marvel um most of my
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
thunder has been stolen as well um but I
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
did want to to uh point out that uh I
 
03:46:45.870 --> 03:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
viewed this uh I I regard this uh Bill
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
only and I I know it only in concept and
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
I support the concept um but I regard it
 
03:46:54.189 --> 03:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
u an opportunity uh to correct a
 
03:46:57.920 --> 03:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
u an opportunity uh to correct a
longstanding

03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
longstanding
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
Injustice um we on the Conway budget
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh have tried to figure out
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
exactly how much money uh Conway
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
businesses provide to the state through
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
rooms and muls taxes and have had a hard
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
time finding that number but by
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
extrapolating from county numbers and
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
from Conway's uh prominence uh in that
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
county uh it's obvious to us that we get
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
only a small fraction of what we
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
generate um so I was somewhat uh uh
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
attracted to the discussion um that just
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
happened but um the the bill itself
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
strikes me as as simple fairness we uh
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
we in
 
03:47:51.149 --> 03:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
Conway um pay basically for the impact
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh industry that provides so much
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
money to the state and we get very
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
little of it um and that that really is
 
03:48:06.429 --> 03:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
you all right uh final pink card I have
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
is um and I apologize I can't read this
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
clearly it's
 
03:48:26.469 --> 03:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
Co sorry I did scribble there at the end
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm uh from Conway as well and I'm
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh grappling between sitting here as a
 
03:48:39.229 --> 03:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
citizen or sitting here as the chairman
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
of the the planning board because I am
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the planning board for
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
the town of Conway and as Paul said
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
earlier we have approved quite a few
 
03:48:49.229 --> 03:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
hotels in the recent
 
03:48:52.269 --> 03:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
years and recently last year we proposed
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
a moratorium on building hotels and um
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
commercial structures of 50,000 square
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
foot or greater
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we need to and we're putting it
 
03:49:04.269 --> 03:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
back on the warrant again this year um
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
03:49:08.670 --> 03:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
because we just we're at a loss as to
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
what to do to to help our citizens to
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
help the people who live and work in
 
03:49:16.110 --> 03:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
Conway to help people like me I'm a
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
bluecollar guy I took the day off to
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
come down here I have family I got kids
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not easy for somebody
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
like me to get down here I think I
 
03:49:27.990 --> 03:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
represent a large portion of the
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire who can't
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
come to these but I really wanted to
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
come down and speak to this um the the
 
03:49:40.189 --> 03:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
reason we're proposing the moratorium
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's funny that the Lodging
 
03:49:44.590 --> 03:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
Association lady who's not here who who
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
left she brought up um liy or die right
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
as a planning board member people often
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
ask me why do we need another hotel why
 
03:49:54.910 --> 03:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
did you let them do why did you let them
 
03:49:56.429 --> 03:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
build another well we have to we follow
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
the rsas we do things properly as we
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
should well
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
Freeport they um they have a cap on gas
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
stations they can't build any more gas
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
stations in Freeport one in one out
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's it well free port's Maine that's
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
a different state Maine gave their
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
citizens the freedom to vote that
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
in all right well what's with our
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%

03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
help the the taxpayers the guys at the
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
bottom yeah it's not going to solve all
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
the problems it's a little bit that
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
helps you asked what would help a time
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
machine would help because New Hampshire
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
sat on hands for way too long about
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals it has completely
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
destroyed the assessments up in Conway
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's insane what we're dealing with
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
because I live in a community that's
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
half empty all the time now I I was born
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
and raised in Conway the community I
 
03:51:24.990 --> 03:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
lived in used to thrive it was the place
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
where we would all the all my friends
 
03:51:29.710 --> 03:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
lived now every other house is empty
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
most of the week because they're
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals those houses were
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
purchased way over value and it's it's
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
just a mess I mean this is insane to me
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't feel like there's a lot
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
of support for this it's two I mean I
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
heard $2 there was that I think that was
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
a great the 2% back um but nobody in
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
this room would cancel a 7day stay for
 
03:51:57.389 --> 03:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
$14 a night if it was $2 a
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
night it's just I don't understand what
 
03:52:03.630 --> 03:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing to help the taxpayers in the
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it seems like
 
03:52:07.710 --> 03:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
there is a constant drum being beat for
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
business business business but where's
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
where's the representation for people
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
like me I'm struggling and we had the
 
03:52:17.149 --> 03:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
police chief who makes way more money
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
than I do saying that he couldn't afford
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
his home you think I can afford mine I
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
bought it probably four years before he
 
03:52:26.070 --> 03:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
did so we were very fortunate when we
 
03:52:28.630 --> 03:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
bought our house it got evaluated at
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
almost half a million dollars and it has
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
the original Kitchen in it that was
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
built in
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
1970 okay it's not a half a million
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
dollar home but the market is so messed
 
03:52:40.030 --> 03:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
up and we are just looking for ways for
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
a little relief we need we need the we
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
need the services we need the sewer we
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
need Town Water and Sewer if we want to
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
put more housing in we need that for
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
density we need to increase those lines
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
through town we need ways to pay for
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
that um we need to increase the police
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
force because of what we're dealing with
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
with the tourists you know whether or
 
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
not this gets passed or not Portsmith
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
still needs a ladder truck and you know
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hampton still needs police police you
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
know officers and that's just going to
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
continue to fall on the backs of people
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
like me and I just really hope that you
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
are all willing to do the work on this
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
bill there seems to be a lot of places
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be you know
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
strengthened up and and reassured that
 
03:53:23.469 --> 03:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
this money is being used properly and
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
does help the budgets where it can I I
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak and I'm
 
03:53:31.590 --> 03:53:31.600 align:start position:0%

just I was born in New Hampshire I love
 
03:53:36.269 --> 03:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you know just trying
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
to do what I can thank you thank you
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
GNA have questions if you want to remain
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
seated okay one uh yes go ahead thank
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr so what does the average family
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
in Conway need what does the average
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
blue collar worker and or blue collar
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
small business owner need to survive
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
what what do you think the problem is
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
let me
 
03:54:04.269 --> 03:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
rephrase how do we solve the problem as
 
03:54:05.469 --> 03:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
you perceive
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
it well it's
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's it there's no magic bullet
 
03:54:13.950 --> 03:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
solution there's there's only little
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
ways to help from every angle and that's
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
what I hope that this do this doesn't
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
seem like a big ask it really doesn't a
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
couple dollars a night does not sound I
 
03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
don't know anybody that would turn down
 
03:54:29.229 --> 03:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
a vacation you know you're talking about
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
going away for a long weekend then
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
someone says it's going to cost you6
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
extra dollars what are you going to say
 
03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
you going to say no not going to go now
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
say all right I'll pay six I'll pay 10
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
want to get away for the weekend so you
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
support you support that fee idea I I
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
support the fee idea I do support the
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the um in in the rooms
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
and meals with the 2% being able to go
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
back to the town it's just finding ways
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
to even the playing field I guess um a
 
03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
lot of people often say in Conway to me
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
as as a chairman now I'm speaking as a
 
03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of the planning board you know
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
how can how can how can how why doesn't
 
03:55:11.149 --> 03:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
why won't the tour how can we get the
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
tourists to
 
03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
pay their share to pay to help burden
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
the costs of all these things so you
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
know making sure that the roads are
 
03:55:21.070 --> 03:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
cleared and that the poth holes are
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
filled and those all the fire calls that
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have and you you know the the police
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
department needing the the support they
 
03:55:29.359 --> 03:55:30.750 align:start position:0%
department needing the the support they
need

03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't know what the
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
solution is to make it better like make
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
it all the way fixed I do feel that um
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know what what does a blueco collar
 
03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
worker need they need a roof over their
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
head they need a place to live you know
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
I have friends who grew up with me who
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
were born the same town as me and they
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
moved to Brownfield Maine because it's
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
you know it's a little bit more of a
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
drive but it's they can live there
 
03:55:59.710 --> 03:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not a tourist destination
 
03:56:02.590 --> 03:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
and the the housing market what didn't
 
03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
get out of control
 
03:56:07.229 --> 03:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
um I I don't
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
know exactly
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
what the what the solution is you know I
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
feel like maybe now I'm rambling but I I
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
just I came down here to to to say my
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
peace and to you know implore everybody
 
03:56:21.870 --> 03:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
to to help work on these solutions for
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire um I I
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't think this is I I don't see how
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
anybody loses from this it's and
 
03:56:31.630 --> 03:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the right to vote it
 
03:56:33.750 --> 03:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
in vote it out you know I think that's
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
the solution when it comes
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
to um communities and working together
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:56:41.830 --> 03:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
I joined the planning board in Conway in
 
03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
2017 I was 34 and I was naive I didn't
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
realize how long it took to make change
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure that so my father
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
he's here he's he's on the select board
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
he was born in Conway his father was
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
born in the valley as well I was born in
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
Conway and my kids were born in Conway
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure that Conway
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
was a place that could continue to have
 
03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
families and and one of the big things
 
03:57:11.710 --> 03:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
that I was admitted on is what are we
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
doing about short-term rentals well it
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
was wait you know it's before the state
 
03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:17.479 align:start position:0%
let's not make a decision till the state
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
does and that didn't pan out well for us
 
03:57:26.670 --> 03:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
um now it's certainly you know it it's
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to care so much about
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
something that you have so little
 
03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
control over and as I stayed on the
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
planning board for my three-year turn I
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
reran I was elected chair I'm the chair
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the planning board now when I joined
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
the planning board our meetings were on
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
average you know 40 minutes long and it
 
03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
was mostly we have these hearings for
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
commercial development we hear them we
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
approve them we move on you know they
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
meet the the zoning RS and our meetings
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
now are regularly 4 hours five hours
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
long and that's because we're having
 
03:58:00.070 --> 03:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
conversations we are talking about these
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
things we are trying to find solutions
 
03:58:04.830 --> 03:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
that work for everybody and often times
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
those Solutions are wealthy a Butter's
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
not happy and the developer not happy I
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
guess that's the solution like if nobody
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's Happ I don't know it's we we
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
are just trying to work through as much
 
03:58:17.710 --> 03:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
of this as we
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
can but we don't we don't have there's
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
our hands are tied with some of the rsas
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
like I stated before about you know what
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
other states are allowed to do and
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
calling States like Massachusetts
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
taxachusetts isn't fair Massachusetts is
 
03:58:33.309 --> 03:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
a beautiful state there's a lot to
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
admire there's a lot to admire in every
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
state around us I love New England love
 
03:58:39.630 --> 03:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's
 
03:58:42.510 --> 03:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
just a lot that we can look to in other
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
states and say they're doing it right
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
and there's some people that come before
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
the planning board and they say well
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't this isn't uh Manchester it's
 
03:58:52.030 --> 03:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
not Manchester but maybe Manchester's
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
doing it better you know this isn't
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island well okay it's not Rhode
 
03:58:57.550 --> 03:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
Island you're right but let's look at
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
what works in certain places and not
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
stand on our Laurels so much that we're
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know cutting off our nose despite
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
our face it's it's frustrating sometimes
 
03:59:09.309 --> 03:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
um but I'm here here because I care and
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
I know that you are all here because you
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
care as well it's being a public servant
 
03:59:15.630 --> 03:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
I've found is a very thankless job and
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of time so um that's
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you thank you very much
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're gonna think hard on this
 
03:59:24.910 --> 03:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
one so I hope you
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
do um quickly yes represent fellows um
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
you talked about there being a lot of um
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
homes in your neighborhood that are
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
empty during the week and there are
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
people there just on the
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
weekends it yeah so are those people who
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
own those homes and only show up for the
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
weekends or are they being rented for
 
03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
the weekend both there's primarily
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's um short-term rentals I don't
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
know the owners are actually um you know
 
03:59:56.910 --> 03:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
out of state somewhere and they're just
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
on one of the local listings the Airbnb
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
or verbo vbo or um there was a couple
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's one across the street very nice
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
couple they they do come up and use
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
their own home they don't red out and I
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair yes yeah very briefly as a
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
former planning board chair I sympathize
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
and con commiserate with most of your
 
04:00:24.670 --> 04:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
comments thank you uh these are genuine
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
predicaments can we agree though that
 
04:00:29.870 --> 04:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill might address the need to
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
raise funds for emergency services like
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
police and fire but it would not address
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
the genuine problem you've identified
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
regarding short-term
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
rentals yes absolutely and as I stated
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
before no one solution is going to
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
address every problem I we don't live in
 
04:00:46.640 --> 04:00:47.630 align:start position:0%
address every problem I we don't live in
that

04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
world right
 
04:00:49.600 --> 04:00:51.110 align:start position:0%
world right
exactly

04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
much yes represented Al
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
me just address something that came up
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
that most of you don't know about yet is
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
it something we should address in work
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
session or is it something to mention
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
now on I think it would be useful to
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
mention it now because the head of
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant and lodging is here okay uh
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
we um a number of years ago a brami and
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
major and I were on a commission with
 
04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate whereby the Senate Port
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth people were trying to on use
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
the to divert the money from the rooms
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
and meals tax to the communities that it
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
came from it turned out that this was
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
totally impossible to do because on the
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
um we had passed many years before it
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
the ability for on owners of
 
04:02:05.309 --> 04:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
multiple on restaurants to file all of
 
04:02:08.670 --> 04:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
them as one tax filing
 
04:02:12.550 --> 04:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
and they were frequently filed even by a
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
accountant who didn't live in the same
 
04:02:17.790 --> 04:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
town with the owner so the accountant's
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
address was on
 
04:02:22.910 --> 04:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
it so that there is no way at this point
 
04:02:22.920 --> 04:02:23.750 align:start position:0%
it so that there is no way at this point
to

04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
identify where that money came from when
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
it gets to
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
Dr and um I believe the restaurant and
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
Lodging Association has been making sure
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
we don't change that again
 
04:02:41.710 --> 04:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank
 
04:02:44.110 --> 04:02:44.120 align:start position:0%

04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
this money comes out of the state
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
piece everybody with me so far or all
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
your blood sugars are less than
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
20 okay so anyways that's that's what
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill does uh there's a fiscal note
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
on it it's difficult to determine the
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
exact costs uh meals and rentals tax has
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
been trending above plan a recent period
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh we were over double it was 72 million
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
collected on 36 of plan more recently
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's been right about at plan uh and
 
04:06:12.990 --> 04:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
actually even a few pennies behind plan
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
but these are traditionally slower
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
months for those uh for that particular
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
tax so the cost of this is uh less than
 
04:06:24.149 --> 04:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
the current Surplus and Le less than the
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
recent surpluses generated by meals and
 
04:06:28.830 --> 04:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
Rental tax so this is money straight
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
back into the pockets of the people who
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
need it most and I know it's only sounds
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
like 1% but the average household spends
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 bucks a year eating out so
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
this makes a differ difference it
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
certainly makes a psychological
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
difference when your Bill's 998 versus
 
04:06:46.269 --> 04:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
109 or 1010 or something like that you
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
know times three four kids and parents
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
and whatnot so it really makes a
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
difference so my belief is that this
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
will actually stimulate that economy the
 
04:06:59.149 --> 04:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
servers and waiters and waitresses are
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
likely to benefit from better tips
 
04:07:03.070 --> 04:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
remember the old double the tax when it
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
was seven and a half and you get 15% it
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
was an easy way to tip most of us I
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
think tip more than that now but I think
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
a little more disposable income will
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
actually keep people eating inside New
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not going south and may eat
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
out just a little more often and that's
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
good for everybody that increases our
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product well you all know
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
the economics of it
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I will dispense with reading there's
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
some charts and graphs in here you can
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
read at your Lea Ledger it's in your
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
email the Kirk clerk has a hard copy
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions and just to
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
clarify it does keep the the town's
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
whole so this money comes out of our
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
piece and it's meals only because the
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
thinking is with my finance co-sponsors
 
04:07:46.389 --> 04:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
and my ways and means
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um that we're just fine
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
collecting the rental uh rooms and car
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
rental taxes from the out ofate visitors
 
04:07:57.149 --> 04:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
and that 1% wouldn't make too much of a
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
difference there so okay thank you uh
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
represent PL did you have a question we
 
04:08:04.349 --> 04:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
had two questions one Dre was just
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
generated supposedly have a hard copy
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
I'm buried in paper here where do I have
 
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
it I think I just put it on your your
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
desk right right behind your name plate
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
maybe oh yeah said I'm buried in paper
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
it says clerk copy at the top I think if
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's I guess the second question was
 
04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
obviated because you say it's only meals
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
not RS as written it's currently targets
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
just meals okay I had a question whether
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
you would allow a local option but since
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide for room reduction
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
well it's the committee's bill now and I
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
certainly heard some interest in local
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
option uh not my preference but my
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
preference is a straight tax reduction
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
of about 30 million straight to the
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire uh but other
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
states actually I think probably the
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
majority of other states in my research
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
do have uh locally
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
enacted uh sales taxes taxes on meals
 
04:08:57.990 --> 04:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
and rooms and things and I'll share with
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the other folks uh who told a
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
story it is my least favorite thing to
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
see a 15% city tax or 12% city tax when
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
I you know rent a hotel room somewhere
 
04:09:10.830 --> 04:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh that that makes me dislike that
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
particular City it feels very personal
 
04:09:14.429 --> 04:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
somehow when it's the state it's a
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
little less personal um but if youve
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
rented a room in New York or Chicago or
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
La Chicago is I think the one of the
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
highest you know what I'm talking about
 
04:09:23.840 --> 04:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
highest you know what I'm talking about
thank

04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
you representative spillsbury yes so to
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
follow with the obvious question in
 
04:09:31.710 --> 04:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
light of the conversation on the last
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill which you were here to hear and
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
your observation regarding Massachusetts
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
and other states using a local option uh
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
if the committee took your bill and
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
amended it so that it covered meals and
 
04:09:50.109 --> 04:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
rooms but had an offsetting local option
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
would you recognize your baby and still
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
want to keep it or would you become an
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
opponent it's a great question and thank
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
you for your question and your
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness on it um and I know the
 
04:10:02.349 --> 04:10:02.359 align:start position:0%
committee will deliberate it uh as will
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
finance so originally as in as first
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
drafted it was for both
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and some input from at least one Finance
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um you know convinced me to
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
Target meals so since I believe it's
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
going to go to finance you have a
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
preview of at least one of their members
 
04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
opinions on
 
04:10:21.800 --> 04:10:24.750 align:start position:0%
opinions on
it

04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
Aly yes well I was just trying to ask
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
you is this bill actually
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
early um my records show that none of
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
our bills are early yeah don't usually
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
send things to finance and this is a
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
problem when you don't have a budget
 
04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
year uh I wanted to ask you
 
04:10:48.399 --> 04:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
year uh I wanted to ask you
on

04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:10:54.990 --> 04:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
if you realize that the Surplus that
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've built up is quite unusual and is
 
04:10:58.560 --> 04:11:00.189 align:start position:0%
we've built up is quite unusual and is
going

04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:11:00.199 --> 04:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
going
down

04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
and uh the business taxes just went down
 
04:11:12.030 --> 04:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
almost 10% this month last month
 
04:11:12.040 --> 04:11:14.189 align:start position:0%
almost 10% this month last month
December

04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
December
 
04:11:14.199 --> 04:11:15.910 align:start position:0%
December
um

04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
whether the idea that we could take all
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
of this out of surplus
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
isn't something that might not survive
 
04:11:28.030 --> 04:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
for very
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
long thank thank you for your comments
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I'm keenly aware of
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
the status of the Surplus and follow it
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
pretty closely um I'm also incredibly
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
aware aware of inflation and where it's
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
been up and down a bit and the most
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
common thing that I hear from my
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
constituents is how am I going to put
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
food on the table and gas in the tank
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that's a direct quote uh from
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
numerous constituents but one of the
 
04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
very first I encountered uh recent
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
recently but it's one of the biggest
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
concerns so I know it's a small amount
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's meaningful and there's
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
a reason that marketers price things at
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
9.98 or you know instead of 10 $10 and
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
change so but thank you for your
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
comments yeah do you have any
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
suggestions on what programs we should
 
04:12:20.510 --> 04:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
remove from the state budget
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
no thank you representative
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you Mr chair um you you
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
said that this tiny cut would make it
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
easier for some people to put food on
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
the table and you also said that that
 
04:12:39.630 --> 04:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know that your constituents are
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
talking about like you know how can they
 
04:12:41.600 --> 04:12:42.630 align:start position:0%
talking about like you know how can they
afford

04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
afford
 
04:12:46.710 --> 04:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
food um what we heard for the last bill
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
and what I hear is people saying I can't
 
04:12:51.550 --> 04:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
afford to live in my house because the
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes are too high and I'm
 
04:12:59.710 --> 04:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
wondering since we're looking at um the
 
04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
money from the meals tax not not the
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
rooms that's a separate issue this just
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
covers from the meal and what we use
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
that money for we give 30% to the
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities to help them you know
 
04:13:19.870 --> 04:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's unrestricted money and do you think
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
if people are as I believe um are most
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about property taxes and also
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
the price of housing that they might be
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
better served to not count cut the rate
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
and instead give
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
maybe 50% or more of that money to the
 
04:13:44.109 --> 04:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that that would
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
better serve your constituents I wonder
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
what town you're from uh marac uh of 33
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
years in marac thank you for your
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
comments and I believe that our
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned about all of
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
their their entire tax burden and every
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
dollar helps every dollar back to their
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
disposable income helps them put food on
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
the table whether it's from the grocery
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
store or elsewhere you know people a lot
 
04:14:08.109 --> 04:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
of people buy prepared meals from the
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
grocery store they're working families
 
04:14:12.750 --> 04:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
working two jobs get home late they pick
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
up the I do it on the way home from here
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
pick up the $6 meal from Market Basket
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
they're pretty good you should try them
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh but it's a great way you know for if
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're working managing a time schedule
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
and people are keenly aware of the tax
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
on those because that those meals are
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
taxed as you know when you go through
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
the checkout so I think our constituents
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
um are concerned about their entire tax
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill and every little bit helps and no I
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't encourage you um uh to send
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
more a 50% allocation and the details
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
you mentioned are all are all in the
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
bill actually uh if you take take a look
 
04:14:46.830 --> 04:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
through it you'll see it's it
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses the 30% keeping
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the towns whole with minimum but so I
 
04:14:54.630 --> 04:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
think every bit every tax reduction
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
helps and U just to Circle back to
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative aly's question about
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
which programs I would cut uh that'd be
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
a long answer and we' we're already over
 
04:15:07.109 --> 04:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
two hours behind so the simple answer
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
answer is is no off the top of my head I
 
04:15:14.189 --> 04:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to name my top five least
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
favorite programs uh but there's more
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
than five and I I know that this
 
04:15:21.109 --> 04:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
committee is more than capable of
 
04:15:21.119 --> 04:15:22.469 align:start position:0%
committee is more than capable of
finding

04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
finding
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
them uh representative
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
ery thank you representative for taking
 
04:15:31.510 --> 04:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
my question um you indicated that you
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
were splitting this uh so that you were
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
um segregating out meals for verus rooms
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and rentals sort of um that would
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
require a change in dr's computerization
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
program did you calculate into that the
 
04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
cost to administer a change of that
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
magnitude thank you representative ery I
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
I do believe the fiscal note mentions
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
that that they had have to change a form
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
and update some electronic submission
 
04:16:00.149 --> 04:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
process and I think they indicated
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
specifically uh that that cost would be
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
negligible and absorbed in their current
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
budget I think it's buried in the very
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
lengthy fiscal note it's on
 
04:16:11.070 --> 04:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh maybe
 
04:16:11.080 --> 04:16:13.229 align:start position:0%
uh uh maybe
page

04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
four of the fiscal note in that area it
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
does say it in there it's a minimal
 
04:16:19.080 --> 04:16:20.990 align:start position:0%
does say it in there it's a minimal
adjustment

04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
um oh okay but but it does mention it
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
they do take that into account and I'll
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
find it for you in a second I think it
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
said uh somewhere in there it does say
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah actually the very last on page
 
04:16:33.670 --> 04:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
five additional administrative costs
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
that could uh or could not be absorbed
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh see oh thank you and another question
 
04:16:45.229 --> 04:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
sir follow up okay um this is kind of a
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
theoretical question but um I've noticed
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
that the cost of going out for breakfast
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
has gone up a $10 breakfast is now $20
 
04:16:54.239 --> 04:16:56.750 align:start position:0%
has gone up a $10 breakfast is now $20
with

04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
tip at my local Diner um so eight and a
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
half this for the purchaser 8 and a
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
half% of $20 is X
 
04:17:13.149 --> 04:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
but 7 and a half% of a $40 meal would be
 
04:17:13.159 --> 04:17:14.349 align:start position:0%
but 7 and a half% of a $40 meal would be
X

04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
X
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
Plus so if it cost you less in the tax
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
you have more money to spend on the meal
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
or you could get a big better meal for
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
the same dollar value is that a correct
 
04:17:30.109 --> 04:17:30.119 align:start position:0%
analysis of your spending pattern there
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
we go
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm I'm not sure I know we eat out
 
04:17:35.309 --> 04:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
less due to due to the cost due to the
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
cost of it for sure uh I I know that we
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
go to you know one Diner that charges
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
you know eight bucks for an omelet
 
04:17:44.590 --> 04:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
versus 15 um but I your math is probably
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
sound I I don't know we'll I'll defer to
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the uh one of the accountants on
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
the committee to work some of those
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
models but there's certainly a lot of
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
ways to work the numbers Patty went no
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
Patty went to work with the secretary of
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
state perap of uh ORS is thank you well
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
qualified thank you Mr chair
 
04:18:06.990 --> 04:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank thank you
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
question um I would like to know I mean
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
you said that you mentioned that your
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned about the
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
high cost of food every mine are too and
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to know how you would
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
answer a question from one of my
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
constituents or yours who might say
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the 50 per 50 cents off my
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant bill
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
my property tax bill has gone up
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
$500 great question what what would you
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that we say reducing property
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you for your question yeah
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is not the time for debate thank
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
you m representative shamard thank you
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative of
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
taking this question you just happened
 
04:19:04.349 --> 04:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
to mention that you reduce property
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxes but looking at the the charts that
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
the Dr has provided it indicates that if
 
04:19:11.000 --> 04:19:11.790 align:start position:0%
the Dr has provided it indicates that if
you

04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh
 
04:19:18.030 --> 04:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R it's going to reduce the amount that
 
04:19:20.670 --> 04:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
goes to public goes to education
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
fund how do we make that up if
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
it so so I believe when you reduce that
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
and make it cheaper more people will eat
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
out more often
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
right follow up right and that and that
 
04:19:39.070 --> 04:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
numerator goes up and is that a
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
theoretical or is that a data do you
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
have a data on that that proves that
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
point there's reams of data and it is a
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
fairly generally accepted economic
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
principle of how to increase gross dtic
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product I mean I think we
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into econ 101 here but
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
but I but it's a fairly widely accepted
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
principle um it doesn't always work
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's it's hard to predict
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Market's going to do on
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
a given day and you know whether we're
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to have a pandemic or a war or
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
whether we want you know those those
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
right and I'm not an economist nor an
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
accountant uh point of order uh
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative ORS you are a
 
04:20:25.710 --> 04:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor so you can't ask questions
 
04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
you can testify or ask questions one or
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%

doesn't testify right no isn't it a
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
choice no no okay no the choice is you
 
04:20:43.389 --> 04:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
you can sit out there or sit here but if
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
you sit here you can't can't ask
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
enough no
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%

yeah Sirus more serious uh comment if if
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state were to reduce the uh room of
 
04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
meals tax wouldn't that just give room
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
for the restaurants to raise their
 
04:21:14.760 --> 04:21:16.550 align:start position:0%
for the restaurants to raise their
prices

sure good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck I represent
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:22:25.109 --> 04:22:25.119 align:start position:0%
in the 234 cities and towns in New
 
04:22:27.790 --> 04:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am not here to comment
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
on some of the policy of House Bill 1515
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
as whether or not it's a legislative
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
prerogative to reduce the tax itself I
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
am here to affirm that we are we
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the sponsors considered
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
keeping the municipal piece intact um at
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
the 20 129 million or 30% whichever is
 
04:22:53.309 --> 04:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
greater we appreciate that and that the
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax well has been stated
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
is unrestricted funds that go into our
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
general fund I did provide you all a
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
handout a long sheet that talks about
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
the property tax and how it's set and on
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
the back of that sheet it is coming
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
around I
 
04:23:12.070 --> 04:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
apologize it's
 
04:23:12.080 --> 04:23:14.189 align:start position:0%
apologize it's
coming

04:23:14.189 --> 04:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
um I will draw your attention to how the
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
tax rate is set and it is recorded meals
 
04:23:22.510 --> 04:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
and rooms revenue is recorded as revenue
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore directly reduces the tax
 
04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
rate so if there's a question in your
 
04:23:28.149 --> 04:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
minds as to how towns are using those
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
funds it is recorded as revenue and has
 
04:23:33.870 --> 04:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce the tax rate as per the dr's
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
tax formula I also have a handout that
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
goes into a little detail on the history
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
of meals and rooms and thank you
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Al for your comments on
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
the prior bill but we have enjoyed since
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
the law change in 2021 a significant
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
increase in fact a cumulative increase
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
of $145 million being returned based on
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
the new formula from 2017 to 2021 the
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislature budgeted as is your
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility $ 68.8 million and since
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
the law change now that it's based on
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
30% we saw that number go to 100 million
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
and 22 to 120 million to 130 million so
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
those are significant dollars that have
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
come back to taxpayers to reduce the
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
local property tax so I really did want
 
04:24:21.109 --> 04:24:21.119 align:start position:0%
as you deliberate the bill and the
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
merits of this change to just consider
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that we preserve the missal
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
portion and that while I understand
 
04:24:29.950 --> 04:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
based on the previous Bill there was a
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
around local options and where some of
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the monies are collected but they aren't
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
maintained this does provide an
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
equitable way to give back to all of New
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cities and towns and it does
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
go back to 1967 so populationbased meals
 
04:24:49.149 --> 04:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
and rooms um is something that we would
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
like to preserve for all our cities and
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
towns I know my own town has one
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant and one Inn so we would never
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
make up the difference that we are
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
seeing from the current distribution
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
formula so I did want you to consider
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
that and if it pleases the chair I will
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
leave a copy of the last two years in
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
detail so you can see of the meals and
 
04:25:10.990 --> 04:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
rooms distribution by town I can email
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
it as well so you can see in your
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
communities what has been given back
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
directly and been reported on your Ms
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
434 to reduce your local property tax
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think an email would be great as
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
well of course sir and I'm happy to take
 
04:25:23.560 --> 04:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
well of course sir and I'm happy to take
any

04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%

04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
do not have a position on the bill and
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
um we're here today to just discuss any
 
04:27:12.990 --> 04:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions you may have though I would
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
like to clarify that um this bill is
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
only impacting the meals portion of the
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
tax uh the portion of the tax that goes
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund is the
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
rentals or the vehicle portion of the
 
04:27:28.349 --> 04:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
tax so we do not see an impact on the
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and what that was
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
presented by somebody else in the fiscal
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
notes so we will just be talking about
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
fund okay um there any questions Wendy
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
well let me just say Wendy when you get
 
04:27:52.349 --> 04:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
a chance if you'd pill out a pin card
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
for this bill when you're done you gave
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
me one for a different um the last
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
bill so just for a quing purposes yes
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
representative fellow so I I had a
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
question on the last page the
 
04:28:09.630 --> 04:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
back about the
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
administration is that money that's
 
04:28:14.109 --> 04:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
going to Dr
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
or what so that is money that stays in
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
the general fund the Dr is a general
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
funded um agency so that's just the
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
money that is related to administering
 
04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
the meals and room and it doesn't
 
04:28:30.750 --> 04:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily stay with the Dr but
 
04:28:32.830 --> 04:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
technically it could if you look at the
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
way the SOA is
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:36.830 align:start position:0%
way the SOA is
funded

04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
so to follow up to follow up on that I'm
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
not clear what you're saying is it is it
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
established as a percentage or how is
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
that determined this is an annual
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
calculation that is done based on uh all
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
the revenue that comes that comes in for
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
taxes and then what port and then we
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
look at the expenditures related to the
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
administration of um meals and rooms so
 
04:29:06.030 --> 04:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's not every uh part of the Dr
 
04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
expenses are eligible for the
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
calculation and then that percentage is
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
what's used as a set aside to the
 
04:29:11.640 --> 04:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
what's used as a set aside to the
general

04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
annually um representative shamber did
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
a Oh I thought someone else down here
 
04:29:26.199 --> 04:29:28.830 align:start position:0%
a Oh I thought someone else down here
represent

04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.840 --> 04:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
ol

04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
ol
 
04:29:31.760 --> 04:29:33.389 align:start position:0%
ol
okay

04:29:33.389 --> 04:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
you on back on page four I think it is
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill it's it's fairly confusing
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we have time to read
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
the T the text if it it doesn't look
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
like it becomes less confusing there on
 
04:29:55.469 --> 04:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is that
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we'll have to be paying more
 
04:30:06.360 --> 04:30:06.370 align:start position:0%
from uh in table two more from uh the
 
04:30:06.370 --> 04:30:07.670 align:start position:0%
from uh in table two more from uh the
[Music]

04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
on from the meals and rooms Revenue
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
then uh we would at
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
30% it'll will
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
Lo yeah
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah on table
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
two on I think what you're saying is
 
04:30:36.189 --> 04:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
that on by the time the tax is f
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
changed we will lose 12 million a year
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
for the general fund because we're
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
paying more than the hund uh we're
 
04:30:47.680 --> 04:30:48.750 align:start position:0%
paying more than the hund uh we're
paying

04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
paying
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
129 million and it looks like we'll be
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
getting less than that at 30% that's
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
correct so at um this is a static
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
analysis so that's just based on the the
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
activity that we in 23 exactly so with
 
04:31:05.790 --> 04:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
that reduction what how we do that
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
calculation it will be a reduction to
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
the general fund but then you have to
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
fund from
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh from the direct loss of of the uh
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the percentage to
 
04:31:33.109 --> 04:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
percentage whatever it was of of the
 
04:31:33.119 --> 04:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
percentage whatever it was of of the
males

04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
males
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
tax and and we'll we'll end up losing
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
from the general fund 53
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
static that is correct because you have
 
04:31:53.550 --> 04:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of the loss from the meals
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
portion of the tax as well as the
 
04:31:57.389 --> 04:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
additional funds going to the municipal
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
fund okay so we do have on 53 million it
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be 53 +
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
12 correct that's uh that's in total uh
 
04:32:09.510 --> 04:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry let me just reread you're
 
04:32:12.070 --> 04:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
looking at table
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
three so yeah so a full year impact
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
would be 53.2 million to the general
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
fund due to the decrease as well as that
 
04:32:25.469 --> 04:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
fund thank you which we'd have to take
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
um Municipal Association indicated that
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
there was a direct relationship between
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh State um revenues and revenue sharing
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
and the town effect but and Town and
 
04:33:00.109 --> 04:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
County property taxes now I know in my
 
04:33:03.109 --> 04:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
town it's roughly 6% goes to County it's
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's relatively small
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh portion of it um even in Nash
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's it's really
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
small so disc
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
County the less than 10% that counties
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
take into consider to take out of your
 
04:33:19.199 --> 04:33:20.269 align:start position:0%
take into consider to take out of your
property

04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:33:23.070 --> 04:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
taxes the other property taxes are based
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
upon School costs and town
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
Administration costs and of those the
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
school has direct control over how much
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
they're taking out of property taxes and
 
04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
the town has a direct proportion as to
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
how much they're taking out of property
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
taxes and how much the state gives to
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
them has no effect upon how much the
 
04:33:50.189 --> 04:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
individual towns wish to pay so anything
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
the state gives is gravy s so as to
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
speak would that be the right way to uh
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
or a more correct way to look at the
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
relationship between State
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
rebates general term not
 
04:34:09.869 --> 04:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
specific but just general term to the
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
towns rather than saying that the the
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
state has a direct impact upon local
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
property taxes when it's a addition
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
to uh local property taxes am I getting
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
it am I saying that the right way
 
04:34:30.150 --> 04:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
or I'm thinking I'm understanding the
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
question um I would have to get back to
 
04:34:35.551 --> 04:34:35.561 align:start position:0%
you with an answer on that I am not I
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
not going to pretend to be an expert on
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
the property tax portion I can reach out
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
to our Municipal uh
 
04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%

04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
is so one block is just um isolating the
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
decrease to the meals portion of the of
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
the proposal the second block is looking
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
at the municipal Revenue fund
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
distribution and the third block is the
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.551 --> 04:36:03.561 align:start position:0%
changes does that answer your question
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
or have I confused you so are you you is
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
this the block here which table are you
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
referring to is that table one table two
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
t Okay table two is that current using
 
04:36:19.230 --> 04:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
where where is if we do nothing usually
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
I see figures that say if you do nothing
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
these are the numbers and if you
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
implement this Bill here's the
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
difference so um in table two at fiscal
 
04:36:32.109 --> 04:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
year 25 would be the do nothing option
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
and that is because the way the
 
04:36:35.949 --> 04:36:35.959 align:start position:0%
municipal fund transfers is calculated
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
it's the prior fiscal Year's um results
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
um goes into the calculation for 25 so
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
then when the when this tax decrease
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
goes into effect we're not going to see
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
that any Municipal Revenue fund until
 
04:36:52.109 --> 04:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 when we use the fiscal
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
year 25 Revenue results to calculate the
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
26 Municipal fund transfer amount so the
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
reason that it goes down from from 129
 
04:37:05.070 --> 04:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
down to 118 that's the rate cut correct
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay it's not really um
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.310 --> 04:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
that cor so what you're seeing in fiscal
 
04:37:17.070 --> 04:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
26 is the results with the with the rate
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
cut and can you explain Table Three
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
also um that is the summary of tables
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
one and two together because both tables
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
one and two are impacting the general
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
fund so what we're showing is that you
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
have that seven you have that 1%
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
decrease is going to cause x% decrease
 
04:37:40.830 --> 04:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
to the general fund just by the nature
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
of it being a tax decrease and then you
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
have an
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
additional amount um that's com out of
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
the general fund to fund the municipal
 
04:37:52.590 --> 04:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund transfer portion because uh
 
04:37:55.230 --> 04:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to have a floor so
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
if we don't meet the 100
 
04:37:58.959 --> 04:38:00.551 align:start position:0%
if we don't meet the 100
9.2

04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
9.2
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
million um based on performance we have
 
04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
to still remit 29.2 million if we do
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
better than that that's great and the
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
30% calculation um takes effect but if
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
the 30% is a lot less then we have the
 
04:38:22.109 --> 04:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
whole thank you you're welcome okay any
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who would like
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
to testify on hp55
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
1515 well that was
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh we're a little bit over maybe by two
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
hours um so I want to
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
ask I want to ask everyone um did you
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of procedure because
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
now our next two meeting dates are
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 16th and Wednesday the 17th
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
and the schedule is set in a similar way
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
where I have a bill every half hour
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock
 
04:39:12.429 --> 04:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
um do you do you did you prefer how this
 
04:39:15.830 --> 04:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
went or would you prefer that we try to
 
04:39:17.551 --> 04:39:17.561 align:start position:0%
um add a little more time and have a
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
lunch break um this went longer than
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
than anticipated I certainly didn't
 
04:39:24.429 --> 04:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
anticipate it going this long so I like
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
to hear some feedback um yes represent
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
ol um this this wasn't that bad but it I
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
think we need to put some discipline on
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves we need to stay focused on the
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
language of the bill in front of us not
 
04:39:43.230 --> 04:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
on General topics and we're all guilty
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:39:45.440 --> 04:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
of that
um

04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
and you could do it like the Senate does
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
half an hour and if you don't like it
 
04:39:52.560 --> 04:39:53.390 align:start position:0%
half an hour and if you don't like it
too

04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
bad what does that mean well if you go
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the Senate bill they have it at their
 
04:40:01.230 --> 04:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
time and when the time is over meeting's
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
over the hearing's over even if
 
04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
even if people they they shut up I don't
 
04:40:10.510 --> 04:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
think that would go over well I like the
 
04:40:11.708 --> 04:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
concept but I don't think it would be a
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
good idea one thing though is if you've
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people talking put your
 
04:40:19.868 --> 04:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
microphone on please sorry if we've got
 
04:40:22.030 --> 04:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people talking and particularly
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
when what was it six of them are from
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
Conway yeah on get them all to come
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
together and on and start telling people
 
04:40:37.470 --> 04:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
that on you've got two three minutes to
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
make your
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
point and then if we got a lot of
 
04:40:45.390 --> 04:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions it gets longer but yeah um
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
well I I agree with Jordan made a good
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
point we shouldn't be asking policy
 
04:40:52.750 --> 04:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
questions of of the people because
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
because that's where in the work session
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
we should be discussing those sorts of
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
things we should be talking about the
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
specifics um of the bill U
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes I would just like to say that you
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
know being on I I was on different
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
committees for the the last two terms
 
04:41:13.470 --> 04:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
but I I think this always happens when
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
you the first day that you get back
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
because everybody you know you just
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
jumping back into the work and I think
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we so excited about it we just like
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
want to talk more so I think I think
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
it'll partly clear itself up yeah some I
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
mean some of it's the bill some of it um
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to
 
04:41:35.230 --> 04:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate well there a lot lot of I
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
never expected HB 1254 to have that many
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
people talking I mean that totally took
 
04:41:43.230 --> 04:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
us by surprise because if I knew this
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
was going to go this long I certainly
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
would have scheduled a lunch break prior
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
to this schedule um and maybe you know
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
we can look at the um the schedule I
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
have now because by Wednesday I can
 
04:41:57.150 --> 04:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
change because right now I've got both
 
04:41:59.190 --> 04:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
those days you know every half hour
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
again and if it goes nicely you might be
 
04:42:05.110 --> 04:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
done by 12:30 or maybe 1 and I think
 
04:42:07.230 --> 04:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
everyone likes that idea because when it
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
looked like that was possible everyone
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
elberger is it
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
permissible um this is my first term so
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to figure out is it
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
permissible to limit testimony to five
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
minutes and if so can we do that can and
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just going to sort of toss
 
04:42:35.310 --> 04:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
out a bunch of things can you as chair
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
say if you more forcefully and I was
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
really appreciative as we got into the
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill that you said don't repeat um but
 
04:42:46.990 --> 04:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
just to say to somebody who starts
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
repeating have you got something
 
04:42:54.270 --> 04:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
new yes um and I I also
 
04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
wonder and I I have no idea about the
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
answer to this one whether it makes
 
04:43:03.390 --> 04:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
sense to schedule more time and finish a
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
little bit early
 
04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
or to just say you know show up and we
 
04:43:11.470 --> 04:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
may not get to you for an hour after
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're scheduled well so if you so if we
 
04:43:18.070 --> 04:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
if I schedule an hour and they finish
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
early I can't start the next one so
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's the theory of doing it every half
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
hour um and you know like as I said
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and Wednesday next week are
 
04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled that way so potentially I
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
could leave it like that and then if it
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to go long again I
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
could could take the Pulse of the room
 
04:43:38.230 --> 04:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
here and see if you want to go to lunch
 
04:43:39.868 --> 04:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
the the problem is when it's scheduled
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
that way the people that are here
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
probably don't really want to go to
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
lunch they want to get it done so I
 
04:43:45.878 --> 04:43:47.150 align:start position:0%
lunch they want to get it done so I
could

04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
change I'll I'll get you in a
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
second um we still have time to change
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we'll look at in in a
 
04:43:56.670 --> 04:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
second here is just let's look at that
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
quickly to see if you want you guys want
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
me to change the scheduling um
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
representing flat yes from the clerk's
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
perspective I get stir crazy after a
 
04:44:10.990 --> 04:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
while I need the break uh and I need to
 
04:44:12.670 --> 04:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
sort some of the papers out because I
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
just get overwhelming here I need some
 
04:44:18.670 --> 04:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
food in my belly okay yeah so uh I
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
realized didn't anticipate it going this
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
long but if it if you do anticipate that
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
I could appreciate the lunch
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
speak thank you so yeah I as I think uh
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
Susan said I would like to I would have
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
liked to have uh shortened the testimony
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the first uh person and Sally and I
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
were talking I tried to catch her I
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
didn't realize she was going to walk out
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
but we were both had come to that say
 
04:44:53.788 --> 04:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
she kept repeating herself and and just
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
kept going on and on and it you know we
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
took over just over an hour yeah on her
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
alone and if we had you know somehow
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
come in even close to 40 minutes we we
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
could have maybe kept it on I so I think
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is I don't care you know what
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
side of the fence they on I think we
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
need to shorten that and say look you
 
04:45:16.030 --> 04:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
got five minutes and if they hit five
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
minutes or give them four minutes and
 
04:45:20.788 --> 04:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
then you know if we think it's necessary
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
give him a couple more minutes but wow
 
04:45:24.830 --> 04:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
that gal took like forever okay so
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple things one is
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
um and to answer represent Elber
 
04:45:33.390 --> 04:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
Berger's question in more detail I
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
believe if and you can correct me if I'm
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
wrong represent Al me but I believe if
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to limit how long people can
 
04:45:40.948 --> 04:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
talk I have to start that at the very
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
beginning and I I I admit when I saw
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
that big stack I should have from the
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
beginning just
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
said I need everyone to limit their
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
their testimony to three minutes um you
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
know because I saw and I thought well
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it goes but then you start
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
getting deeper into the snack and people
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
have five minutes on there or whatever
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
and then it's you you are not I believe
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to start saying okay now from
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
now on we're limiting everyone because
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
now those you know people feel cheated
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
any well five minutes is still a lot I
 
04:46:14.120 --> 04:46:18.070 align:start position:0%
any well five minutes is still a lot I
mean

04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
I yeah that I know I mean that happens
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
all the time in all different committees
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
um I every time that happens I do feel
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
like saying can you just outline it but
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is the person comes
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
here they they may not be able to
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
outline it and then they're gonna feel
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
like so I think we also have to be
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
careful with our questioning like if
 
04:46:51.150 --> 04:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
we've got answers there were a few times
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
where I feel like some of us asked
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
questions that were answered from
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
previous speakers I don't think we need
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
to ask the question again um so I think
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
there were multiple things there was
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
only yeah
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
I think that medical it's important that
 
04:47:13.390 --> 04:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
we get a lunch break yeah no and I I I
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
agree but the problem is and I need to
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
take a menum break after sitting here
 
04:47:20.350 --> 04:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
for almost four and a half hours but I
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
think the issue is when I asked everyone
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
everyone was like yeah let's finish it
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
up we didn't really realize it would go
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
this long so now given this experience
 
04:47:30.548 --> 04:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
you know what should we do for Tuesday
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
and Wednesday should I increase the
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
amount of time for each of those not the
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
seven person who spoke yes represent
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
Ames I'm not sure about that last
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
question um I I um I think I I would
 
04:47:45.280 --> 04:47:46.350 align:start position:0%
question um I I um I think I I would
strongly

04:47:46.350 --> 04:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
strongly
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
encourage um on any bill that's likely
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
to take time setting time
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
limits right at the outset yeah um and
 
04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
with with some leeway to you in your
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
discretion if some something is being
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
said that needs to be fleshed out make
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
that judgment call I think you're
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to do that and then um the
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
burden is very much on us in this
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
committee to discipline ourselves on our
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions and uh that's a big part of
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
the reason we went a long time today
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
right um so on those two counts but in
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the time allowed per bill
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
you do get into this qu of you allow an
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
hour you know that you may sit around on
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
your hands for 15 45 minutes yeah um and
 
04:48:44.590 --> 04:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I might stick with the 30
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
minutes allow time for lunch if and um
 
04:48:50.670 --> 04:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
and then we all know that we're going to
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
go home a little later maybe you know
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the set of bills at 30
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
minutes each and you say oh boy I'm
 
04:48:58.590 --> 04:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
going to be out of here by 1:00 okay
 
04:49:00.390 --> 04:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to be but take time
 
04:49:02.990 --> 04:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
for lunch yeah I don't know whether
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
other people would agree with that it's
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
nice to March through these things and
 
04:49:11.070 --> 04:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
be done but uh um I guess I would
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
favor a lunch period if if the
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
calculation of 30 minutes times the
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
start time okay plus start time yes
 
04:49:24.430 --> 04:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
represent sburg I know
 
04:49:27.310 --> 04:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
you I think uh the extent to which
 
04:49:29.548 --> 04:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
things went over today isn't the norm
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
and for planning purposes I wouldn't
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
presume that this repeats itself every
 
04:49:36.670 --> 04:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
second session yeah um I I agree with
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
most of the comments that I've already
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
said about disciplining ourselves and I
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
think one of the key things is you've
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned with several of the bills this
 
04:49:45.390 --> 04:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
morning that we're going to have a work
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
session if we could just have a clear
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that we all anticipate
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
that there will in fact be a work
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
session on every bill then I think it
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
allows us to be much more restrained in
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
terms of expressing ourselves during a
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
hearing um so I I would encourage you to
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
stick with the schedule you've already
 
04:50:03.000 --> 04:50:04.510 align:start position:0%
stick with the schedule you've already
uh

04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
noticed okay yes I I I hesitate to
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
suggest it but if you uh have a sense
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
that things might take longer and
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can sort that out by
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
what's the topic
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps we start at 9:30 I am
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
not a fan of getting up early I'm just
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
putting it out and also to make clear at
 
04:50:34.270 --> 04:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the day that that we
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
will be taking a lunch
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
break and that way people who are here
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
for a bill that's later in the schedule
 
04:50:45.788 --> 04:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
May will understand from the get-go that
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
they probably won't be speaking until
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
after the lunch
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
break yeah I won't I won't know that
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
from the beginning though that's more
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
likely to be known you know around 11
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
11:30 or something we're starting to
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
fall behind maybe at that point I said
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to finish up Bill XYZ
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.878 --> 04:51:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
potentially

04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.958 --> 04:51:14.868 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so real quick uh I like Dick's idea
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
about limiting the time of the testimony
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
I like Susan's idea about maybe starting
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
a half hour earlier I wonder if as she
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
said based on the topic if we scheduled
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
some of these for 45 minutes just to put
 
04:51:37.628 --> 04:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
a little buffer in the schedule maybe
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and last I don't want anybody to
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
faint but even though I SP co-sponsored
 
04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
that last bill I I do not think taxation
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
is theft now what do you think of that
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
idea now my Democrat friends might
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
really shock and fall over on that
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
statement but the other thing that I'm
 
04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
seeing is and I think we all heard it
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
today we need to find a way to tax the
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
tourism more and not the people of New
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we need to because I've heard
 
04:52:08.548 --> 04:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
this seven years ago people I knew
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
friends in BO that were losing their
 
04:52:13.628 --> 04:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
homes they had to move because of taxes
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that now so we got to find
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
a way to tax the tourist industry can't
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe I said that and and not the
 
04:52:23.070 --> 04:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and I Deni that
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.638 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
