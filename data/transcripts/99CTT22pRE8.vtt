00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:52.270 align:start position:0%
 
she

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right uh so I
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
am officially opening the subcommittee
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 146 6 6
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes um after the hearing there were two
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
things that were clear we needed help
 
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
with the first was how fiscal works and
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
how do how would it work with it and I
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
asked representative Wier to give us
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
some information and I also spoke with
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety to see why they
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
thought they needed full five full-time
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
employees for this sort of thing and
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
they said they would send somebody so
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
representative wer you were from the
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety y Rob the director
 
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety y Rob the director
home

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
security excellent all right we're good
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
buddies so your choice what you want to
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
hear from first but I think we need the
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
information well let's if representative
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
wer wouldn't mind um oh I will well all
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
right representative wer um is going to
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
talk about the I guess the fiscal
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee ask
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
ECT so the purpose of the fiscal
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
committee is the
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
Constitution excuse me requires that the
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature appropriates money
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise you can't spend it so we
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
serve as a as a part of that process by
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
having five members of the house finance
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee five members of the sometimes
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's the Senate finance committee
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
usually the president of Senate wants to
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
get in there whether he's on that
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee or not but anyway um so we
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
serve that purpose we meet months or
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
month the majority of what we deal with
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
we have 20 or 30 requests typically each
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
month plus we look at some audits
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal committee by law
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
appoints the legislative budget
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
assistant the legislative budget
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
assistant has staffs has about eight
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
that work in the budget Division and
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
about 30 that work in the audit division
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they do performance audits as well
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
as as is finance audits so we usually
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
have some audit reports at the end of
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
the thing but the basic most of our
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
requests come from Grants that have come
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
through the federal government to
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
various agencies well the various
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
agencies can't spend that Grant until it
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
is appropriated so we serve that purpose
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
by looking at those grants and then
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
quite often they don't use it up in the
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
time they they've alloted so we have a
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
lot to extend the grant deadline and we
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
have them according to how much money
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
there was and what how it was
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
established we split the thing up into
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
several categories according to what the
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
law is and whether it's from
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
non-government sources or whether it's
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
from federal sources and so on and we go
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
through all those requests and and look
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
them over and see you know what what the
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh request is at one point I uh found
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
the ey of the governor and and big
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
Pharma by saying I don't think we should
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
accept this $22 million to hire 15 more
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
people and give them Vans and send them
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
out going door too to insist you take
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
the covid shot when I was hearing all
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
these adverse reactions I think we would
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
be liable for damages if we were forcing
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
it on people and then they were anyway
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's an aside but that was one
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
thing I turned down and and made quite a
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
tussle but um so when representative a
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
um Aaron and I spoke about this money I
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
said let them come to fiscal but it has
 
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
to be a request through one of the
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
agencies to come to to come to fiscal
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
saying you know we'd like to accept this
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
Grant and dispense dispense it here
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
we've also had U rearrangements
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
somebody's got more money in one part of
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
their budget than than they needed than
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
they needed in that budget but they
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
needed in another part so again they
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to come to us because we have set
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
that in a law of how that appropriation
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
should be spent so if you had more money
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
for equipment than you needed but you
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough for con
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
subcontractors so you wanted to change
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
money from here to here then you have to
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
come to us again for permission so those
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
are just kind of procedures that ensure
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
that the appropriating process was F
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
that in fact the
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and the guys of the fiscal
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee has approved this so that's
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's quite a bit of things that come
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
to us every month and U go ahead um so
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there is uh as
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative eron has talked about a
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
like an emergency or disaster fund that
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal can yes access all right and do
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
you think that the law can be changed so
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
requesting entity could be from a
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
town yes it would seem that that would
 
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:16.519 align:start position:0%
be the first place you you'd see it and
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
as you know we've had several things
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
that came down from FEMA usually two
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
years later and you try to make up for
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
all the money initially you you
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
exhausted all the resources of the of
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
the local government trying to to stop
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
the flood or fix the road or whatever
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
and then it takes a while to get through
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
his agency and then they re they report
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
to the feds and then the FEMA money
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
comes but we're forever seeing things
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
two years later that that we finally
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
giving millions of dollars to some to
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
fix things a lot of it's going to our
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
own do and much of it's going to the
 
00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.230 align:start position:0%
own do and much of it's going to the
town

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
do okay so if if I understand you
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
correctly a town could ask fiscal
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
directly to allocate money from the the
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
state Emergency Management fund not
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
federal state we don't have that
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
Authority yet it has it we okay if we
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
were to put to say that the town ask
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal for the money you would be able
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
to say yes we can allocate money from if
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
the law chated fund if the Law changes
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
right now all right so we don't need to
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
involve of any agency we just say the
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
town um aworth is an example says we
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
need $100,000 right now to fix this one
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
road that got flooded out again and put
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
it on the agenda and fiscal would say
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
yes there's 100,000 in our state
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management fund here's your
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
Grant so that that could could could do
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
it I think the state emergency fund is
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
is less than a million dollar this it
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
might not be enough to fix some of the
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
problems that come but the larger things
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
would would take federal grants because
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
as representative Aaron and I have
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
discussed this town is too small they
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
have much of a budget to be fixing mil
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
monthly million dollar damages so those
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
would take longer but the way I read
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
that Emergency Management fund you would
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
think that that would enable them to
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
come directly to the fiscal but it has
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
not happened in my 12 years there on
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
that committee well what what we were
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
hearing from uh representative Aaron is
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
that uh they were looking for immediate
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
help to for example get the main road
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
coming into town uh operable so that
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't take I hope a million
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
dollars but the way it's been done in
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
the past you you go borrow the money
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
especially if the local bank is
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerned because they want the the
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
people coming into town you could go to
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the local Bank you could make a loan you
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
could get the money to hire the
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
contractors and so on to fix it then
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to put in a report you you
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
keep track of every penny that you spent
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
to do this and you have all these good
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
records that you can say yes so many man
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
hours so many contractors and so on and
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
then you would go to that emergency fund
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
this this is a the reason this bill is
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
is to say we don't want to follow the
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
normal procedure we want to get some
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
cash out immediately so that or within a
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
month at at the regular fiscal meeting
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
so that the town can fix their main road
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever as a grant from the state
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management fund and not
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
involve the feds at
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
all right so is that right that's that
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of what you're looking for
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes and and the the problem with the
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
loan process be they get a loan from the
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
state or a loan from masoma Bank think
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
is that when you have when a town goes
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
out to get a loan they first have to
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
have a special town meeting to get
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
approval from from the voters and a
 
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:12.519 align:start position:0%
special town meeting process could take
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
up to three months because you have to
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
hire a bond attorney you have to notice
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
the meeting you have to get it approved
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
by Dr uh there's a whole process for
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
putting setting up a special town
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
meeting that's the problem with the loan
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
process and that's why are seeking to
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
have grant money
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
accessible within a week a month as soon
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
as possible for the town to use so that
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
they have funds to um address immediate
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
concerns all these things are slowed up
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
by the assessment how much do you need
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
and when is it going to be
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
spent okay that that can take excessive
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
um what I want to know is the I
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand the emergency State emergency
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
fund has something like $45,000 in it
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
would a a check within a month for
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
$40,000 get atworth able to get going on
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
their requests for more detailed
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
assessments and all that would be
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
helpful um you know certainly they would
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
have they would have to exhaust their
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
present resources and keep very careful
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
track of what they spent and I can
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
assume the town can keep track of their
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures but I mean that that's the
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that I got the impression
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
was really needed you don't want to have
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
the the state come in with a $10 million
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
Grant to fix your road because that's
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
going to take as long as FEMA right
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what you want is a is a little
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
bit upfront so you can hire people to do
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
the assessments put up a temporary
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
Bridge or reroute some road right yeah
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and I mean you know you know and
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
and the thing is that you don't want to
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
have this fund fund a million dollars
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
worth of work or $2 million worth of
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
work because whatever work a grant would
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
fund from the state would then be
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
ineligible for any kind of reimbursement
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
from FEMA coming back yeah would so
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying should we redo
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
this so that the maximum amount is
 
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.949 align:start position:0%
this so that the maximum amount is
50,000

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
50,000
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
say and but it comes out quickly yeah I
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
mean would that help
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
because I I gathered the impression that
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
the process of really figuring out
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
lengthy yeah um I I Even Say closer to a
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
100,000 rather than
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
50,000 we could 50,000 doesn't go far
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
these days doesn't go very far when when
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're doing you know trying to um do
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
EXT fix extensive damage or at least
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
well no I I think it's more a matter
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
matter of you know fix fix your ma Main
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
Road temporarily and then start dealing
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the application process and the
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
loan process and the grant process all
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
funding um because that that that's what
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning towards saying we should do
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
is just say ask for a modest amount of
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
money get it relatively quickly and then
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
proceed with the normal uh process is is
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
there currently a procceed
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
for I don't know I would guess fiscal to
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
um mandate putting perhaps a million
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
dollars into that
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
fund that that could be a request again
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
from Emergency Management if they come
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
in and he says you know the amounts of
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
are so minor that you can barely fix one
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
little pothole well and I'm thinking
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
because uh obviously sometimes when
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
these natural disasters happen it can
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
involve two or three small towns and so
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm thinking if you've got
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
three towns saying we need 40,000 boom
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
you're over the 45 quickly oh yeah so
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
all right well we'd have to allocate
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we we've done a bit of
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
backfilling where people said here's how
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
much we had to spend at dot we spent all
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
this extra money um we've overspent this
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
part of our budget uh over this
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunate problem now we need to have
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
more money put into our budget from
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that would be the kind of
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
thing we'd get from like the do so if if
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
they can get involved especially if it's
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
a state
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
road um then you know it's they have an
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
easier process because they have more
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
depth of funds to draw
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
on okay so I think that all yeah yeah I
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
I think the important things is that
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal can move money from anywhere to
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere else pretty much and that the
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
town assuming we added it into statute
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
the town could could request it directly
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
from fiscal without requiring yeah
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else if you put that in statute
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
then but I mean obviously with do and
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management coming in and
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
support if because they they have a
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
little more dep of funds they can draw
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
on whereas this you know if it's 50,000
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
and it hardly starts to help with the
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
problem well I'm not sure we want to
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
displace FEMA exactly but I don't think
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
aworth can properly deal with FEMA
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
without some cash up front right and so
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I my my my thinking which
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
may or may not be with representative sh
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
is thinking is that we help aworth apply
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
for FEMA using State funds to you know
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
patch patch one road maybe because f is
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
likely to come by will cover
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
75% and 12 a half% from the town 12 a
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
half% from the state typical and some of
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
the grants so it it's not automatic that
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to cover everything and
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're still going to be perhaps in debt
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the town for a while because of what
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
happened um sometimes towns have
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
insurance that they can try and collect
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
from and sometimes that takes years well
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
I personally wouldn't ensure aworth are
 
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.350 align:start position:0%
I personally wouldn't ensure aworth are
for

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
floods but you know these are all things
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
that can be looked at but you know I
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
thought there was a way for Judy to get
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
it quickly through Emergency Management
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
and um we found out that that we're
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to talk to them next yeah yeah but
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
clearly if emergeny management is there
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
saying yes we there's there's been a
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
disaster and an emergency in aworth and
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
we support helping them get through it
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the process is is far long
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
than it took to destroy the
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
road uh would the would the form of this
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
coming from through fiscal from this
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
emergency fund just be termed a grant is
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
would that be the proper yes it would
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
fund

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um I think we'll hear
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
Management I have to say his folks have
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
been great they've been really wonderful
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that sorry this speaker
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
is like right like I'm like which side
 
00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:16.149 align:start position:0%
is like right like I'm like which side
of

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
the so Rob buckton director of Homeland
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management the
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
question that was posed was regarding to
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
the phisical note that was attached to
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh does HSM need additional
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
staff to facilitate a $5 million state
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
run grant program okay
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
um all of our employees in hscm are
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
covered by some form of management cost
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's actually received from FEMA and
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
other locations so whether it's C Brook
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
station for a portion of the agency or
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
from the federal government um under the
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
rules of the
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
disaster relief program from FEMA I
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
can't utilize those management costs to
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
manage your fund so that's we were like
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay what is the what is the bandwidth
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
that they're looking to
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
create what is the funding mechanism
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at and we look at
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
right now we're managing 11 open
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
disasters unfortunately the disaster the
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
storm rate is increasing not decreasing
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had a event in December
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
of this year that we're working through
 
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.190 align:start position:0%
of this year that we're working through
right

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.269 align:start position:0%
right
now

00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
um the the process for FEMA is lengthy
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
as both representative Aaron and
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler know like this is
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
a long process um and it's a
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement reimbursement program so
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
we we have to find the middle of the
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
road as to what the scope of you're
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
looking to develop and say okay is this
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
going to be a continuous funded program
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
is this a onetime fund what what are you
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
looking to create so when they said hey
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
here's a new program coming
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
on it looks at $5 million this time
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
what's the growth potential going to
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
look like hey we need to stand this up
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
with some additional staff that's funded
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
directly from there uh so that that's at
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that's just kind of
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
there's if I may yes the there's you
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
know two different approaches to it one
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
is to say that we would provide
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
substitute funding for instead of going
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
through the FEMA process because it will
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
be quicker and easier for everybody and
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
less paperwork but that
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
requires your operation to
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
manage the other thing is to
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
say a small town can't properly deal
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
with an emergency dealing with FEMA and
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
the assessments and all the all getting
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
a calling a town meeting for a loan in
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
any reasonable length of time and we
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
want to give them a grant so that they
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
can get the process started which is not
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative Aaron was
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about but from the testimony I
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
think that may be useful makes sense
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and so that you could say you know
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
give them 50 or
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and include it in the costs
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that you're applying to FEMA because it
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know when you wake up in the in the
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
morning and your main roads are
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
gone you know it's going to be a lot but
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
you don't know how much right right
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely I I mean I understand so if
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
that were to be the case and you'd have
 
00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:44.950 align:start position:0%
that were to be the case and you'd have
a

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
fund I I was thinking that say aworth
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
could go to fiscal and say I
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
want 50 or $100,000 from the emergency
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
fund we'll keep track of how we spend
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
it and your department would say it
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
appears there was a disaster that
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
affected a aworth and when we do the
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
process we'll be we'll be supporting it
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
and so you won't necessarily be
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
administering the fund so much as
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
saying this is available for the towns
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
and they can use it
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
for their share of of the U or even the
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
State share you don't care who gets
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
counted for it we don't have to wait a a
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
month for a fiscal meeting we've called
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
them within a couple of days there was
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
something urgent right well if you know
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
like say six small towns in in in um san
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
county had a flood they would all come
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
and say Hey give us a give us a hand to
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
get going because meanwhile do is
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
invading the place and looking looking
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
for what happened and they'll be the
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
town is saying oh my God we're going to
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
have to borrow a fortune again but it'll
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
take a while to have the town
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and it's even going to take a
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
while to get an analysis from an
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
engineer based upon past here's the
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
pictures here's what's here's what's
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
happened how much washed out I think
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough one of the things
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and I know we're talking about
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
aworth is remember the dot is going to
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
come in and take care of State Road and
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
they certainly will uh give a hand
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
within a certain distance of State Road
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
um you had a lot of damage that was
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
outside of state road yeah and that that
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
was really one of the challenges with
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
community and you know some of them were
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
um pretty major cross sections to be
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
able to get around town
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
so between some of the programming that
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
we've established for uh Public Works
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid where other communities can
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
come in and working with local vendors
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
like there's been some movement in
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
regards to how do we leverage and expand
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
resources to get them more support so
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
some of the problems though with mutual
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
Aid yeah is that if you have several
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
communities in the same area they don't
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
have corre correct
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
AB because they're using absolutely um
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
so what we had we had in the July 2021
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
flood um what we we weren't able to get
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
um um um anything from Mutual Aid we
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
were able to get things like um barriers
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
and signs and sandbags and that kind of
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
thing from the do the the regional do
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
stations yeah um and and David rodrig
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
was wonderful in helping us do that but
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
um that also took a lot of time to
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
coordinate and and put that together um
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
the other issues that um you know we ran
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
into was just
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh the the the time aspect you know we
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
we had do crews around um mostly in
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
getting contractors you know people were
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
out working on whatever other issues and
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
it was it was difficult to even get the
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
people to do the work we ended up having
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
to set up a program within our town
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
where Town's people could register as
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers to the town and bring their
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
back hose or their construction material
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
whatever to help fix things so we had
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
volunteers coming in from our town to
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
pitching in to to opening these roads
 
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.350 align:start position:0%
pitching in to to opening these roads
and

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
um you if we didn't have the people
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
helping us out I don't know where we be
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
oh that's what what towns do I mean we
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
had the Mother's Day fled in six a
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
couple of people brought their back hose
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
around to uh contain the evulsion yeah
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
and then you know on top of that all you
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
can't do any work without getting Dees
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
permits and that whole permitting
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
process too can be timec
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
consuming so um that that's a whole
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
other issue
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
yeah one last question sir um you've
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
been listening to this this whole idea
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
of changing the the process you don't
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
see any part of that as disrupting what
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
you excuse me what you need to do in
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
order to help towns is that no this is
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
another tool in the full box
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
potentially just wanted to be sure
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
covered all the bases okay thank you I
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
did want can I ask director a question
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so with regard to a town obtaining
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
some grant money and being able to do
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
some work to open up
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
roads right
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
away how does that play
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
into later reimbursement through F
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
because that's the biggest argument I
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
found against doing something like this
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
is that if a town gets money from the
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
state or anywhere else and does some
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
work to open up a road temporarily that
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
that may
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the town from or make them
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
ineligible to get funds for FEMA to fix
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
that road permanently yeah and that
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
certainly is uh a change that FEMA is
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
looking at right now a lot of states
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
have looked at their disaster relief
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
programs because storms are coming more
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
frequently right um and how do they put
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
funds aside that are going to be spent
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
locally and then have them be
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
recoverable right and and that is I
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a FEMA policy that can hand
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
hand you and say it's going to be
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
recoverable yet but that is a
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
conversation that's being had because we
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that that you
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
know we all you know every emergency
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
starts locally until it isn't anymore
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
right and it gets big enough that we
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
need to give State support and then
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
Federal support you know and and the
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
federal uh disaster relief program has
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
been challenged because of the increase
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
in number of Storms and the length of
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
time it takes and what they we've
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
expressed as emergency management staff
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
is you need to also provide opportunity
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
that when a state does put a foot
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
forward to put some money aside it has
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
to be part of the recoverable value that
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to reimburse to the to the
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
state or to the community so we're we're
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
work we're trying to work that out as
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know this is a fluid today and that
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't need State legislation it needs
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
Federal yeah and and that's more that's
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
more policy not even legislation it's
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
not a a change to the staff act that
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
would be a policy that they would put
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
internally so we have a situation now
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
where we still have cranebrook road
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
which is totally destroyed and out and
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
not even existing anymore where um we
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
have folks in town who are willing to do
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
the work temporarily to fill in places
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
to make the road passable and we've
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
asked FEMA can we do this temporary work
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
and not be penalized for it later on and
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
they said oh yeah sure it's fine but
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
then a month later they changed their
 
00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
then a month later they changed their
mind

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
so now we're still in the situation of
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
still waiting to hear whether we can do
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
this temporary work and make the road
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
passable or not and so here we are
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
sitting with a road that's
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
still not usable gone whatever Fe is
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
beyond our control yeah that's beyond
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
our control but I just wanted to give an
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
example of okay you know how even a town
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
can be so paralyzed based on what the
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
federal uh federal guidelines have been
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
because we're afraid to do certain work
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
because oh my God then we won't ever get
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed when we come to do the
 
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.590 align:start position:0%
reimbursed when we come to do the
permanent

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
work it's a
 
00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
problem anyway
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
75% correct it's a 7525 for the 2021
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:25.869 align:start position:0%
 
Chang

00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've heard enough to start
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
looking at language and see what we need
 
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.869 align:start position:0%
looking at language and see what we need
to

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
change yeah yeah I think the um I had to
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you we've got a couple of of
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
ways we can move but I think we want to
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um question so this
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
is going be your subcommittee you're G
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation yes yes we'll we'll work
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
out well if we can work out some
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
Language by the scheduled exact we will
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
have it if we can't we might decide
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
um simplifying something like this I'm
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
thinking also though if if we endorse
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
the policy uh and send it on to finance
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that have to
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
work out that mechanis that's why it's
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
early bill is going to
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
fin yeah because yeah like represent Aon
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
I represent was devastated and I think
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
there a few other communities that were
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
not as bad but we our towns in solivan
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
County really need help so what do and
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we seem to be having fiveyear floods
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
now instead of 100e FL unfortunately the

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.589 align:start position:0%
weather patterns and it's affecting our
infastructure

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay but but I think
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
re revisioning it from disaster relief
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
to a helping hand to deal with disaster
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
relief would make the the whole process
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
a lot simpler right because I think the
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
federal is fine but takes a while just
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
the town's got to deal with
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
a you know a grant to get through the
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
so those that's s
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
separate this is this is after a
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
disaster so they're two two different
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
commit a
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
lot app that we'll see you soon see you
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
soon okay do you know and otherwise I
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
were theth this thing that screwed up
 
00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:46.349 align:start position:0%
were theth this thing that screwed up
the

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy punishment if somebody did
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
something wrong in Pharmacy and he said
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
author it's probably
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
