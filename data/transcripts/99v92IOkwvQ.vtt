here in session as i said we are here
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
being live streamed to receive comments
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
on the maps that have been posted online
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
there are two maps for every
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
district that
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
have been proposed by committee members
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
and we're here tonight to take input on
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
that mapping
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
if i didn't say so there is mask seating
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
to my left those would be in what we
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
refer to as sections four and five of
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
the hall
 
00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.629 align:start position:0%
the hall
and

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
if you didn't know
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you look down at the little metal
 
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
if you look down at the little metal
plate

00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
plate
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
by your seat
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
and figure that you are in section one
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
two three four or five that is the code
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
to that strange license plate you see
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
around the state that says state
 
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
around the state that says state
legislature

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
with a number one two three or five dash
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that dash leads to the seat number
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that metal plate tells you um what
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
seat you're in so there you go that's
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the that's the code that you see driving
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
around the highway and frankly i think
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's there because none of us could
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
remember our seat from one session to
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
the other anyways
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that's how you find your seat and you
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
find each other
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
tonight so we know who would like to
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
speak in regards to the bills there is a
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
blue sheet outside for sign up i'm going
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
to ask that people come
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
to a microphone after i call them to
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
to a microphone after i call them to
speak

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
a number of people signed up
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
i expect to have more people signed up
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
after we go through these it is my
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
intent and to end this by 8 o'clock
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
so there isn't going to be a time limit
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
per se on speaking but if it gets to the
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
point in the evening where i'm worried
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
that not everybody is going to be able
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to speak who wants to speak we might
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
start doing a time limit and generally
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's three minutes um three minutes is
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually what they tell us as
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
representatives is the limit for time
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
that you should be speaking in in order
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
to get your point across but of course
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's a lot different when you're talking
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
out to 400 people sitting here in the
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.550 align:start position:0%
out to 400 people sitting here in the
hall

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
hall
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd like to get started
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
we did have a session yesterday and this
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes when elections are competitive
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
the candidates must articulate
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
how they will represent all
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
of their constituents and i would like
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
to add here the elected official
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
once elected
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
all of the people of that district are
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
their constituents
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
not just the ones that solely voted for
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
not just the ones that solely voted for
them

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
competition generates more voter turnout
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.830 align:start position:0%
thus better representation of all the
voters

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
what does
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
non-competitiveness in elections
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
what does it produce
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
less choice
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
a more shallow understanding of complex
 
00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.630 align:start position:0%
a more shallow understanding of complex
issues

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
the candidates have no reason to explain
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
what they can do for all
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the constituents they will represent
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
they only need to appeal to one group
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
more extreme partisan candidates
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
no competition between different points
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
of view and no discussion of different
 
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.669 align:start position:0%
of view and no discussion of different
goals

00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
goals
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
less voter turnout
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
thus less representation and less
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
engagement with democracy
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
lower voter turnout can have
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
consequences on down ballot seats
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
no cooperation between the parties
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
no discussion of the goals and needs of
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
the constituents
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
moving 75 towns out of one congressional
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
district and placing them in another
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
is a major change
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
the proposed republican map
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
would move
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
365 thousand seven hundred and three
 
00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.150 align:start position:0%
365 thousand seven hundred and three
people

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this change was stated by
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
republican party chair steve stepanek
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
who argued the party's newly won
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
majorities and the state house and
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
senate would give them the opportunity
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
to change the congressional maps in
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
their favor
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
be quote because of this we control
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting i can stand here today and
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that we will send a
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
conservative republican to washington dc
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
as a congressperson in 2022
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
to which i would say that fits the
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
definition of gerrymandering
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
in an interview with mur
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
in july sunu said he would veto
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
a redistricting proposal and i quote if
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pass the smell test and looks
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
if the republican proposed congressional
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
district map is put forward
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
the governor will have to hose his nose
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
or vetoing
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%

thank you for this opportunity to
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
provide input on your redistricting work
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for providing a public
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
hearing in the evening
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
which will allow more people to
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
communicate directly with you on this
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
shifting to my testimony now
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
what is the point of having a
 
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
what is the point of having a
constitution

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
if you do not read it
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
at your november third work session
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
when presenting the majority's proposed
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house map for coast county
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
stated that a map had no floaterials
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
and he saw no reason to add floaterials
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
i will give you a reason because the
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
constitution says that berlin with a
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
population of 9425
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
should have its own district
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually it does not say should
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
it says shall have its own district
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
what is your reason for ignoring the new
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps the problem is not a failure to
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
read the constitution
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps the problem is misreading the
 
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.430 align:start position:0%
perhaps the problem is misreading the
constitution

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative stephen smith when
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
questioned during the november fourth
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
work session about the majority's new
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire house map for cheshire county
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
offered a novel interpretation of the
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution's
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for redistricting the new
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire house
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
he said that walpole
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
with a population of
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
3633 was a little too large to warrant
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
its own district
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think you could hear the crowd that
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
they collectively murmur
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
i believe the party of the majority is
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
the one that generally claims to hue to
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the legal theory of original intent when
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
trying to interpret words and phrases
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and statutes or constitutions
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
so let's check the legislative record
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
for cacr 41
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
which when passed in 2006 updated new
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution to include the
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
text requiring eligible towns to receive
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
their own districts
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
crcr cacr 41 was sponsored by three
 
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
crcr cacr 41 was sponsored by three
republicans

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative neal kirk
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative richard kennedy and
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
senator robert flanders when senator
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
flanders introduced it in the senate
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
he said quote
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
this crc this cacr provides that when a
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
town or ward has enough inhabitants to
 
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.789 align:start position:0%
town or ward has enough inhabitants to
equal

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
or exceed
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the number required for one
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative seat
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
it shall have its own district
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the majority did not only ignore the
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
constitution and coast and chess here it
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
did this throughout the counties
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
in my county stratford
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
they chose to place dover ward 4 in a
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
district with madbury and lee
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the district this district and a
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
district for durham were then combined
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
to form a floaterial with a single
 
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
to form a floaterial with a single
representative

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
who will represent over 37 000 residents
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
this is crazy for several reasons
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
a large filterial first of all
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
then both dover ward 4 and lee have
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient population to require they be
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
given their own district
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
stratfor county residents also at the
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
county hearing the county listening
 
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.390 align:start position:0%
county hearing the county listening
sessions

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
stated a clear preference
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
for the wards of rochester dover and
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
somersworth to be kept together and not
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
placed in districts with neighboring
 
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.390 align:start position:0%
placed in districts with neighboring
towns

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
and this is totally unnecessary
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
but the minority map as well as the
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
mapathon map
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
keeping the dover and recharge through
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
rochester wards together while providing
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
more electrical towns with their own
 
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.230 align:start position:0%
more electrical towns with their own
districts

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
and does the majority map
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
while keeping the population deviation
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
below the 10 percent threshold
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's no reason
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
for what the majority is proposing for
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
but ignoring
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
in 2011 perhaps you could get away with
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
claiming that your proposed map was the
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
best that could be done
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
but the public has gotten savvier and
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
the computational tools have gotten
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
better and more widely available
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
making that claim now
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
for these bogus maps is simply not going
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
to fly
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
but ignoring the constitution is not
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
just ignoring some words on the page
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
it is ignoring the people who voted
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly during the november
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
november 2006 election to approve cacr
 
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.789 align:start position:0%
november 2006 election to approve cacr
41.

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
41.
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
in fact 71 percent voted for crc cacr41
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
when you ignore the text inserted by
 
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.630 align:start position:0%
when you ignore the text inserted by
cacr41

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
cacr41
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
you are ignoring those 71 percent
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
but when i stopped to think about it i
 
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.669 align:start position:0%
but when i stopped to think about it i
realized

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
realized
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is really what this is all about
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's about rigging a system so that a
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
large majority of the voters can be
 
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.950 align:start position:0%
large majority of the voters can be
ignored

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the majority's proposal for the
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
congressional districts is more of the
 
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.269 align:start position:0%
congressional districts is more of the
same

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
they packing democratic leaning voters
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
in one district and packing the
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
republican leading voters in the other
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
district it has the striking result of
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
ignoring voters of both parties
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
republicans voting in the blues district
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
have no voice in the choice of their u.s
 
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.669 align:start position:0%
have no voice in the choice of their u.s
representative

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
democrats voting in the red district
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
also have no voice
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
all decisions are made in the primary
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the november election is meaningless
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
sound great
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
only if you are a leader in a party that
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
knows it cannot compete on a level
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
playing field and why was the state
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
gop's chair so excited at the prospect
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
of sending one more conservative to
 
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.870 align:start position:0%
of sending one more conservative to
congress

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
congress
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
remember he made that statement in
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
january twenty twenty one
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
only a few weeks after many republicans
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
in congress voted to not accept
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
electoral votes cast for president biden
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
could it be that the new hampshire gop
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
is maneuvering to get one more gop vote
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
in congress to reject electoral votes
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
awarded by the popular
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
vote rigging his system one more time
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
ignoring the constitution one more time
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
to finally get to that holy grail of
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
removing the votes for president by
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
ordinary people
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
and replacing them with the votes of
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
republicans in a heavily gerrymandered
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
u.s congress
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
that would finish squaring the circle
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
please reject the majorities on
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional new hampshire house maps
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
as well as their heavily gerrymandered
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
congressional map
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
let's not weaken any further these
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
pillars of our democracy
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hatch also signed up to
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
speak tonight is brandon lantham from
 
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:20.789 align:start position:0%
speak tonight is brandon lantham from
merrimack

00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair for your time
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'm brandon latham as we heard
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm from merrimack
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
first i want to say if for some reason
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
someone can't hear me with the mask just
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
say so and i'll move away from the mask
 
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.909 align:start position:0%
say so and i'll move away from the mask
section

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll cross that bridge
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm from merrimack we can hear you
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
which means
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
three things
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
above all that we probably recognize if
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
anyone knows the town
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
means if i put a basketball down in my
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
driveway it'll end up in amherst before
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
it stops rolling
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
it means that my entire family lives in
 
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.510 align:start position:0%
it means that my entire family lives in
nashua

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
and it means that i have spent my entire
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
district my entire life in congressional
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
district 1.
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak about the
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
congressional map i hope you'll
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that the principles apply to
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
any maps that we're drawing
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
i mentioned nashua and amherst
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
we share conservation land with amherst
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
we share public water supplies with
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
nashua we also share commercial
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
districts with hollis
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
none of which are also in our
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
congressional district
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
i remember when i was about 13 years old
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
around the time i started high school in
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
nashua and being taught about our maps
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and being taught about the voting
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
districts and thinking that this was
 
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.470 align:start position:0%
districts and thinking that this was
bizarre

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
bizarre
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
and finding it deeply confusing that my
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
friends and family were voting for
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
different people and represented by
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
different people than i was
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't know the term communities of
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
interest at the time or common in the
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
principle of common interest at the time
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
i do now we all do
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
it is clear looking at the proposed
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
congressional map
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
that communities of interest was the
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
last priority
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
that the majority had in mind when
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
drawing the maps
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to advocate that it should
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
be the number one priority
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
but i think that it should be much
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
higher than dead last
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
if only for the reasons i mentioned the
 
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.870 align:start position:0%
if only for the reasons i mentioned the
confusion

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
the lack of representation
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered maps are anti-education
 
00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:19.830 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered maps are anti-education
because

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
not only do they weaken the electoral
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
power of a school district that has been
 
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
power of a school district that has been
divided

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
divided
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
but they also make social studies
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum more difficult for children
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
it never made sense to me then it
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me now
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we are proud of our
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
politics we're proud of this the most
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative legislative body in the
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
world right here in this chamber of our
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
classic new england-style town meetings
 
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
classic new england-style town meetings
which

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
dozens of which and i'm sure someone in
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
the room has the number
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
voted this spring to
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
vote for independent fair maps without
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
partisan considerations
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
i know in my town i'm represented by
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
seven members of the majority
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
who are one of whom was on the town
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
council at the time
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
who appear to have ignored that message
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and we try to
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
continue to be proud of our role as
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
politicos in new hampshire
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
prove that we are still that place that
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
exceptional place with an engaged
 
00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:29.430 align:start position:0%
exceptional place with an engaged
politic

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
politic
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
that we have earned the sacred right to
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
our first in the nation primary
 
00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
our first in the nation primary
instead

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
if we move forward without a revised map
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the majorities map it will be an
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
embarrassment and a stain on that
 
00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
embarrassment and a stain on that
reputation

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't convince anybody the
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
third thing i'd like to mention is
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents
 
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents
um

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
having worked in outreach i did some
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
quick number running on what it would
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
take to inform the approximately three
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand new hampshire rights
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
whose congressional districts would be
 
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
whose congressional districts would be
changing

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
in a fair and equitable way that their
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
districts have been changing so that
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
they can be an informed voter
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
using the bar minimum the lowest that we
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
base mailing
 
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
base mailing
with

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
eddm targeting no specific targeting
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a minimum of 156 000
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be not doing a
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
voter education program
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
which seems
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
like a risk of even more expensive
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that i don't believe the state
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
should be taking
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
in conclusion significant revisions to
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
the majorities map would be
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:41.669 align:start position:0%
the majorities map would be
pro pro-education

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
pro pro-education
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
policy in a more in a more abstract
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
sense pro new hampshire and working
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
toward our identity as proud of the
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
state that we're from
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
you indicated this is to read a letter
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
miss farnam
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
you indicated this is to read a letter
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
it is thank you thank you very much um
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm ellen farnham for tamworth and i'm
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
reading a letter of
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
a friend that lives in part of tamworth
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
known as jacaroa
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks that i know could not
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
attend this meeting in person
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
but are really watching this process
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
closely and are very concerned about
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
this letter is written and when again
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
let me say it again
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'm reading a letter by john gotcha
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
this letter is written to make a case
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
for why the committee should not make
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
radical changes to the current
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
congressional districts in new hampshire
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
the proposed map that has been
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
distributed is the result of a plan that
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
is intended to create one district that
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
would stand a better chance of
 
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.389 align:start position:0%
would stand a better chance of
consistently

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
electing republican candidates rather
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
than the pattern over the past decade
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
where district one is back fourth but
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
republican and democratic parties
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
while understanding that the current
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
majority party is motivated to promote
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
its interest in surging elect and
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
securing electoral wins it is a mistake
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
to move in this direction
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
the biggest mistake is that this change
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
would pretty much ensure the failure of
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
republicans to mount successful
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
campaigns in the new district to
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
discourage viable candidates from
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
running and promote further defections
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
from the party
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
and further should a candidate be
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
successful their chances of doing an
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
effective job and holding that seat
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
would be extremely unlikely given the
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
geographic sprawl of the proposed
 
00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.829 align:start position:0%
geographic sprawl of the proposed
district

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
secondly new hampshire has seen a huge
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
influx of new homeowners due to the
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic driven from the pandemic driven
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
flight from high population density
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
areas over the past two years the timing
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
of which means that it was not
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
represented in the 2020 census
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the committee's proposed radical change
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
of the congressional districts could
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
well be a colossal misjudgment based
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
upon insufficient data
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
the republican party in new hampshire
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
promotes itself as the steady hand on
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
the wheel of the state government
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that the majority party on the
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
house special redistricting committee
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
continues this tradition with the
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
state's two congressional districts and
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
leaves them largely in their current
 
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
leaves them largely in their current
shape

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
shape
 
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
shape
and

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
not risk its long-term future by
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
alienating many current members of the
 
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
alienating many current members of the
party

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for letting me read
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative ed butler has signed up
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%

and again my name is ed butler i live in
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
hart's location
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
in the smallest town in new hampshire
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm the chair of the carroll county
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
democrats as well
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for holding this public
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and for the complex work that
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
i attended the public hearing that you
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
held in carroll county
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
there were a variety of comments that
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
were made
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
none of which i have seen incorporated
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
into the maps that you are currently
 
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.829 align:start position:0%
into the maps that you are currently
considering

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
the most striking of the problems as
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
many of us in carroll county see it is
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
the very thin connection in the hills at
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the top of sandwich and the bottom of
 
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.589 align:start position:0%
the top of sandwich and the bottom of
albany

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
albany
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
where there is no road or telephone wire
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
or likely cell phone connection between
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
the two towns
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
but there is little
 
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
but there is little
if

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
and there is a connection on the map of
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
course between the two towns but there
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
is little if any social or community
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
connection between the two towns
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
or between sandwich and the rest of the
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
towns that are connected through this
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
proposed district
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
sandwich has an affinity with tamworth

through various community and commercial
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
activities and with moultonborough
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
through 10 years of its current district
 
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
through 10 years of its current district
relationship

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
i hadn't seen before tonight the
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
proposed county commissioner districts
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i would just
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider the minority
 
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider the minority
map

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
because even though it does
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
continue to have a sandwich
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
it connected
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
very little
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
connection with albany it also connects
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
several other towns contiguous to it so
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
that there is a block that makes a great
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
deal more sense than leaving sandwich
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
hanging down
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
off the bottom of that
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
top district map
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that there has been an
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
independent effort being conducted by
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
open democracy through their mapathon
 
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.310 align:start position:0%
open democracy through their mapathon
group

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
the last proposal by that group
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the house district seemed to
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
be best to me and to others who have
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
been paying closer attention to the
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
process than me
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
even though it seems to need
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
to need that unfortunate connection
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
between albany and sandwich
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
i hope that you are taking those
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
disservice to available electorate of
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely no one that i have heard
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
talking about this proposed map suggests
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that it defines what
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
party will win in each district
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
what then is the purpose of my vote
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
or the vote of any of those voting for
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
their congress person
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm appalled
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed map for congressional
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
districts by the majority members of
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
this committee is appalling
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to test
 
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.950 align:start position:0%

local as in our towns cities and
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
counties as well as for state and
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
national offices
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
people choose to reside here not only
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
for our scenic and lifestyle choices
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
and opportunities but for the long time
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
respect of individual choices through
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
our election process
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
our two
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
congressional districts as well as
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
counties and towns have traditionally
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
been competitive resulting in offices
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
swinging back and forth between the
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
parties as determined by the voters of
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
when towns counties and districts are
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
competitive the candidates from all
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
parties have to work
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
to attract the support of the voting
 
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
to attract the support of the voting
public

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
they must explain their values
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the goals they bring to that
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
particular office they are running for
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
such as the mayorship legislature
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
they have the chance to honestly debate
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
their opponents
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
this is the democratic process that has
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
held our state in good stead and has
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
made new hampshire a state where
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
fairness has been the rule and not the
 
00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
fairness has been the rule and not the
exception

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
the redistricting map offered by the
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
majority would move 75 towns and over
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
375 residents into a different district
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
to openly lock in partisan control
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
thereby narrowing the public the voting
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%

less disruption

in play

one such map moves only one town
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the other district seems like a
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
simple solution

just take a moment though
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
last month i stood before you in
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
goffstown and spoke of my concern at
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing the governor
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
needing to threaten to veto a map that
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
and now the republican congressional
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
district map that's been proposed has
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's been proposed with the most extreme
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
changes the state has seen in well over
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's been noted that in 138 years
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
22 towns have moved from one district to
 
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
22 towns have moved from one district to
another

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
in this one republican map
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
75 towns awards have been moved
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
22 in over a century

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's staggering
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
how the republican map has been
 
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.069 align:start position:0%
how the republican map has been
gerrymandered

00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
since it's the responsibility of the
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to draw the maps
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%

i'm here to say as a friend
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
remember the purpose of the legislature
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
is to serve our society
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
on this eve of veterans day i'm reminded
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
of some of the army values
 
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
of some of the army values
loyalty

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
loyalty
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
not to a political party
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
selfless service
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
integrity

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
do what's right
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
honor

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
honor
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
living honorably with every choice
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
remember the highest military honor is
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
but let's talk about power since that
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be a motivating force here in
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
this new gerrymandered map put forth by
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
the republican from my republican
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
the republican from my republican
friends

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
for many of you republican democrat i
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
know i'm preaching to the choir when i
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
say those that drew up this map
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
have forgotten how to handle power
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
those of you that continue to conduct
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
yourselves honorably have a personal
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's up to you to remind those that are
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
trying to grab power
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
that the reins of power are to be held
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
remember as soon as you try to grasp it
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
gather more of
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
it you lose yourself
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's a given as long as
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
you can hold the reins of power in an
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
open hand
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
with a personal power greater than any
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
power society may confer upon you
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
but grasp it
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
hold on tight at all costs
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
you are honorable people
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is not an honorable map
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
be courageous
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
in other army value
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
go home and tear up the republican
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
proposed map
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
be bold
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
swim against the current set in motion
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
by party
 
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.589 align:start position:0%
by party
leaders

00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
for those listening and not here i
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
have to put that in quotes
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
do what's right and show ah show us all
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
what's true leader what true leadership
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
good evening my name is bruce burke i'm
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
from the town of pittsfield
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your efforts and
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be redundant i think
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
many of the points i was going to make
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
have been covered so
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
in respect for the work and the time i'm
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
just going to make one point
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that is that
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday the governor of this state
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
declined to run for the senate
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's despite the fact that people like
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
senator cruz
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
senator mcdonald mcconnell put
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous pressure on him
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
i think in the end
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
our governor realized it wasn't about
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
and i think in the end he chose to rise
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
above politics for this moment
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
and look to serve his state
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
rather than just to secure power
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
so many people have spoken before me
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
they've given you the statistics but
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
once again i would ask us to serve the
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
interests of the state
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
and not simply the interest of politics
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to the concerns
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire citizens today
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
about maintaining a fair election
 
00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:31.109 align:start position:0%
about maintaining a fair election
process

00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
and for opening up last week's
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting meetings to the public
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
i hope you will give all these
 
00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.670 align:start position:0%
i hope you will give all these
testimonies

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
of concerned citizens the careful
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
consideration they deserve
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
my name is alice donna selva and i live
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
in concord in ward 7 in the merrimack
 
00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:51.270 align:start position:0%
in concord in ward 7 in the merrimack
county

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
i am a relative newbie
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
to the realm of local politics and then
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
when i entered the redistricting
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee last week
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
i naively expected that i would see my
 
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.309 align:start position:0%
i naively expected that i would see my
representatives

00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
working together to hammer out fair
 
00:50:13.359 --> 00:50:15.670 align:start position:0%
working together to hammer out fair
districts

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
instead what i saw
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
was a room
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
that was divided
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
introduced the meeting with her
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
intention that two maps would be
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
presented at these hearings
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
presumably one republican and one
 
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.270 align:start position:0%
presumably one republican and one
democrat

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
is this the best we can do
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on being first in the
 
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.230 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on being first in the
nation

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
a state that other states aspire to
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of active
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
citizen involvement in the political
 
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.790 align:start position:0%
citizen involvement in the political
process

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
now more than ever
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
with the challenges we face as a state
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
and a nation
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
we need the benefit of diverse thinkers
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
putting their heads together to come up
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
with real solutions
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
instead this process has pandered to the
 
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
instead this process has pandered to the
most

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
based divisive thinking
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
not only succumbing to the political
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
divide gripping our country
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
but exacerbating it
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
the process and the maps that were drawn
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
from it
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
as you've heard particularly the new
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire congressional district map
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
are a disappointment to say the least
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
one year ago
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
you and i and 814 090
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens
 
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.710 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens
stood

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
stood
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
in long lines in the cold to vote for
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
the candidates that we thought would
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
best move this country forward
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
not all of us were happy with the
 
00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.150 align:start position:0%
not all of us were happy with the
results

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
but everyone i talked to
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
republicans democrats and independents
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
were proud to be standing together to
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
vote for the candidate that they thought
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
would best move this country forward
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the challenges we face today
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we rightfully trusted the new
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire election process
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
with all of the
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
the redistricting process that has led
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire congressional
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
district map has been an abnegation of
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
the commitment this committee owes to
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
all of us who stood in those long cold
 
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.790 align:start position:0%
all of us who stood in those long cold
lines

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
does the republican drawn map that i
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
represent a map
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
that is visually
 
00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:50.309 align:start position:0%
that is visually
contiguous

00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
does it look like a map
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
that has that has
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
been redrawn slowly with the
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
population changes in mind no
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
it has a striking resemblance to this
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
it has a striking resemblance to this
map

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
that was on the 538 website back in 2018
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
representing the most gerrymandered way
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
that you could you could create a map
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
while i hate to specify a
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
republican-drawn map and a democrat
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
drawn map this process has left me no
 
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.710 align:start position:0%
drawn map this process has left me no
choice

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
so on the drawing of maps specific to my
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
county merrimack county
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
i support the democrat drawn out
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
it keeps conquered together
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
whereas the republican proposed map
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
divides it twice for no particular
 
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
divides it twice for no particular
reason

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the democratic proposed map contains
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
only five violations of redistricting
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
rules as opposed to eight for the
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
republican map
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the true spirit of democracy
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
the democrats proposed map from
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
actually creates almost twice as many
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
competitive seats as the republican map
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
even at the at the cost of an extra seat
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
for them based on 2020 election data
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
um my name is roger blow i live in ward
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
1 in manchester new hampshire i was born
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
in asheville new hampshire
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i married a manchester girl so i've
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
been living manchester for 51 years
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm very proud of this
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
this committee it's nice that we can
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
voice what we
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
what we believe
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
i've always been a person that
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
my first primary thing is fairness
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
fairness if things are not fear it
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
irritates me immensely
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you know i was a little kid i liked
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
superman and lone range and all that and
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
i remember superman he fought for truth
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
justice and the american way this
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
republican map is not
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
just at all it's not fair it's not right
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
i'm a liberal democrat
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
i worked hard to help
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
chris pappas win i love him i think he's
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
a great
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
person but if the republican would win
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's no problem but if it's fixed if
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's rigged you know what what good is
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
that that's not good at all i think we
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
should have an independent commission
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
the governor sununu had two chances
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
to set up one and he didn't
 
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.470 align:start position:0%
to set up one and he didn't
now

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
i'm a vietnam veteran and i was
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to get my modern shots
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
at the va i had two of them
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
yet i still got covered
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
and uh fortunately it wasn't too bad but
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
i did lose my sense of smell for a
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
little while
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
i know governor sununu had covered so
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe his smell test isn't right to know
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
that this republican
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
thing is is terrible it really really is
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh in 2010
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh the republicans were in charge and
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
they gerrymandered there as well and
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
they broke the state constitution by not
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
keeping towns and districts together
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
like they should have it went to the
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
state supreme court and they let it fly
 
00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:08.870 align:start position:0%
state supreme court and they let it fly
so

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
legally you can probably get away with
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
this you probably can
 
00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:13.910 align:start position:0%
this you probably can
but

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
it really upsets me i fought in vietnam
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
so that i can come to new hampshire
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
which i've always loved and always been
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
proud of and to see our fellow citizens
 
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.710 align:start position:0%
proud of and to see our fellow citizens
cheated

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
cheated
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
out of their votes yeah you know they
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
cut this country started because of lack
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
of representation from the british right
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
we were paying money for taxes we
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
weren't getting a representation if this
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
map republican maps goes through then
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're screwed and and it's just it would
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
embarrass me to be living in the state
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
with that kind of
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh representation thank you
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
good evening distinguished committee
 
00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.630 align:start position:0%
good evening distinguished committee
members

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
my name is mary beth raven and i'm a
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
32-year resident of new hampshire
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
i've lived in londonderry and for the
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
past 30 years in merrimack
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today not only for myself
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
but also to speak for the residents of
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
merrimack had a warrant article on their
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
town ballot this spring
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
asking for fair redistricting the
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
measure passed three to one
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
the voters of merrimack want fair
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
districts and by fair we mean
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
competitive as you all know competitive
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
districts result in elected officials
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
being more responsive to their
 
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.950 align:start position:0%
being more responsive to their
constituents

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
the congressional map that you have
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
proposed for our two congressional
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
districts however has major changes for
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
each district and does not make the two
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
districts competitive
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
the existing congressional districts had
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
a relatively balanced number of
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
registered republicans and democrats
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
in congressional district one it was 31
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
percent each and in congressional
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
district 2 it was 30 percent 32 percent
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
democrat and 29
 
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.710 align:start position:0%
democrat and 29
republican

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
republican
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
but this new proposal may makes each
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
district less balanced
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
specifically the proposal puts
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
congressional district 1 at 34 percent
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
republicans but only 28 percent
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
democrats while congressional district 2
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
is 35 percent democrat and 26 republican
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why you would want to
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
make unbalanced districts
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
your proposal has
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
cd1 having
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
over 1800 more people than cd2
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
we could make that more balanced too
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
and your proposal moves over 186 000
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
people from cd1 to cd2 and 178 000 from
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
cd2 to c1
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
what's the justification for moving 364
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
to different districts
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
i've been a registered democrat i've
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%

and the 26 000 residents of merrimack
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
encourage you to go back to the drawing
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
board and create more balanced
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
congressional districts for the people
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%

for the town

election and keeping files up to date
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%

empowering voters and defending
democracy

00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
in both situations i can say
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
i know and recognize nonpartisanship
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
not being biased or partisan
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
especially toward any political group
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
rollinsford has and has proposed to keep
 
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
rollinsford has and has proposed to keep
four

01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
represent state representatives
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
for the population of 2597.
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
if only looking at rollinsford i can't
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
agree but it's important to understand
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
the larger picture
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
for strafford county
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that is where four representatives
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
are acceptable
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
once again looking at the larger picture
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
in this time for the state's
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
congressional redrawn maps it is packed
 
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
congressional redrawn maps it is packed
gerrymandered

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
 
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
or

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
a prime case where
 
01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
a prime case where
legislators

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
pick their voters
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
where it should be
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
this committee is smarter than that
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
proposed congressional map
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
there is more work for you all to do
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
you have all done work and traveling to
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
each county
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
listening to an array of thoughts for
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
the voters
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
towns and counties
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
in order to represent
 
01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.710 align:start position:0%
in order to represent
correctly

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
the voters your constituents elect you
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
again not the other way around
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
all granite staters are entitled to fair
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
voting districts
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
but more of your work is necessary
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you

good evening representative griffin and
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and a special
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you to the audience all of whom
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
took the time out tonight to come and
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
speak to you i hope that you'll listen
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
i am a former rockingham county
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner i currently live in
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth but prior to that for 40
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
years i lived in derry
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
and represented nine towns as the
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
district three rockingham county
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner for eight years
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
i looked at the map that has been
 
01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
i looked at the map that has been
redrawn

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
redrawn
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i was puzzled by it
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
because it made no sense to me
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
why they would change
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the districts you're moving 175
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
out of the district that they have
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
currently been in and have been in for
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
over 20 years
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
into a new district
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i can't think of a reason
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
why you would do that the districts are
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
not significantly different size wise by
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
moving one town you could have made them
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
almost identical in size that being in
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
the town of newfields
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
into district one
 
01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.150 align:start position:0%
into district one
but

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
it did not make any sense to me why the
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
republican maps made such a radical
 
01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
republican maps made such a radical
change

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
and the democrat maps made no change
 
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
and the democrat maps made no change
whatsoever

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that for the last 30
 
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that for the last 30
years

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
without question
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
every member of the county commission
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
was republicans
 
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.589 align:start position:0%
was republicans
until

01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
until
2020

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
when one democrat who happens to be my
 
01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
when one democrat who happens to be my
wife

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
wife
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
became a county commissioner
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
and because of that
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have new maps
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
which make no sense are going to cause
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
serious issues for
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
who becomes who has the next
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
four-year term who currently has the
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
four-year term now
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
it would it just makes no sense and i've
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
both former and current county
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners and none of them support
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
this map and i would respectfully ask
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
you to go back to the drawing board and
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
leave the maps as they currently exist
 
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.150 align:start position:0%
leave the maps as they currently exist
and

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
as a republican i support the democratic
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%

01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
and i would like to first and foremost
 
01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:49.109 align:start position:0%
and i would like to first and foremost

thank
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
every member of this committee i know
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
you have spent many hours and given
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
much of your time and hard work
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
to this process
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
i also want to thank the minority here
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the thoughtful maps that you've
 
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.109 align:start position:0%
for the thoughtful maps that you've
presented

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
what i particularly appreciated in
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
hearings when you presented the maps
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
was that you gave your reasons for the
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
changes that you've made
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i found that to be very
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to apologize for being
 
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.589 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to apologize for being
redundant

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
for repeating things that are being said
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
by other people or that have been said
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
at other hearings
 
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.630 align:start position:0%
at other hearings
because

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
we need you to listen
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
we need you to hear what we're saying
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
and it's the reason that we're saying it
 
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.630 align:start position:0%
and it's the reason that we're saying it
over

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
and over and over again
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
the people of the granite state want
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.950 align:start position:0%
the people of the granite state want
fair

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.589 align:start position:0%
fair
non-partisan

01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
non-partisan
 
01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:05.829 align:start position:0%
non-partisan
maps

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's as simple
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
as that
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
and it is a goal that can be
 
01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:13.829 align:start position:0%
and it is a goal that can be
accomplished

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
we know that it can be done
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
it just takes the political will
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking this committee to dig
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
deep every member
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
and to find that political will
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
as a conquered resident i currently live
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
in a ward that is combined with an
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
and with hopkinton i'm in ward 5.
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to me that that's
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
my current district
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
although i love my reps i don't think
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
you can find
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
three public servants that
 
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
three public servants that
um

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
that i could be more proud of to to call
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
my representatives
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
i note that under the majority maps
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
this district is maintained in addition
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
ward 7 of concord is put with
 
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.029 align:start position:0%
ward 7 of concord is put with
beau

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
the communities of interest
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't appear to have been considered
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
we don't share schools we don't share
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
fire and police our demographic profiles
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
are very different
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
the demands on our social services are
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
different indeed our very structures of
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
government are different
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
our communities of interest lie
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and for ward 5 and ward 7 in
 
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.789 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and for ward 5 and ward 7 in
concord

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
those interests lie with the city of
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
concord and this is true for cities
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state the communities of
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
interest lie with other wards
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
within their cities
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
and cities deserve to have their
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
interests represented at the state house
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we've heard very little about
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
communities of interest from the
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
majority in fact we've heard very little
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
about what criteria other than the most
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
basic constitutional requirements
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
that have been used to draw their maps
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we had heard more perhaps if
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
we had been told
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
these maps might make more sense to us
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
but without that knowledge
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
we really have no alternative but to
 
01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:29.910 align:start position:0%
we really have no alternative but to
assume

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
assume
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
that politics is the driving force
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
behind these maps
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
in fact we heard from representative
 
01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
in fact we heard from representative
lynn

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
that redistricting of course
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
plays a consideration in the mix i don't
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
think we can doubt that
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're human after all
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
but it does not need nor should it be
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
these maps go against
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
everything the public has repeatedly
 
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
everything the public has repeatedly
asked

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
our legislature to do
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
i repeat
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
people want an end to gerrymandering
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
they want an end to politics being more
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
important than our civic life and our
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
body politic and our ability to relate
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
and connect to one another
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
we want to heal this nation
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
we want to come together
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that we do that is
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
by having fair maps that require
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
candidates to go out and earn their
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
votes by talking to all
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
of the voters
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
and opening dialogue with all of the
 
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
and opening dialogue with all of the
voters

01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i sincerely want
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a democrat i don't deny it i'm a
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
liberal democrat
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
but i want to be talking to my
 
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
but i want to be talking to my
republican

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
republican
 
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.870 align:start position:0%
republican
neighbors

01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
i want their voices represented and
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
these majority maps
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
are unfair
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
and they leave out half
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in the congressional maps
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
we are all the people
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
republicans independents
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
and we deserve better representation
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
than what these maps are giving us from
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
sorry with the tables up here it's a
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
dear committee and fellow constituents
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'd first like to thank the committee
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
for allowing the public to make use of
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
article 32 of the new hampshire
 
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.350 align:start position:0%
article 32 of the new hampshire
constitution

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
giving us a chance to give testimony
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
after the proposed maps were published
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
i personally would like to thank you for
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
listening to us
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
during the previous round of testimony
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
it is hardening to know our requests are
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
being heard
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to thank my fellow
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents for braving the
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic and coming out tonight to give
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
testimony for and against each of the
 
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.709 align:start position:0%
testimony for and against each of the
maps

my name is emily olson i'm here on
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and my family
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
i've been a resident of goffstown
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
my whole life and feel very strongly
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
about shaping the future of the granite
 
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.229 align:start position:0%
about shaping the future of the granite
state

01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
in a way that will see us succeed now
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
and long into the future
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
i was present at the previous public
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
testimony at goffstown high school a few
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
weeks ago you might remember a bit of a
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
fiery testimony then
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
i am honored albeit a little nervous
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
to be here with you tonight
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
my fellow new hampshire citizens have
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
done a marvelous job of going over the
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
numbers so i would like to give a more
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
personal angle specifically
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to go over two points
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
parity and prospects
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
for parity
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
well i personally identify more with
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
titles and after being an independent
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
voter for the
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
majority of my adult life
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
i understand that what is good for me
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
may not be good for the rest of new
 
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
may not be good for the rest of new
hampshire

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
i understand that democracy thrives on a
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
healthy and fair competition
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i understand that both sides of the
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
aisle have tried to upset this fair
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
competition by gerrymandering districts
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
all over the country
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
when redistricting is done in a manner
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
that breaks up seven out of the ten
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
counties and unfairly distributes seats
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
healthy competition is lost
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
when healthy competition is lost and
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
seats are considered safe for either
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
party public servants can safely assume
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they do not need to listen to the
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
people they serve or even respond to
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
their constituents because they are not
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
worried about losing their seat
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
once this happens democracy breaks down
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
a process that we can already see
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
happening in our country and in our
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
state today
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
i personally love being a part of a
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
swing state a toss-up state like i said
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
i've been a registered independent for
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
the most of my life
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
i love going out and talking to
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
democrats and republicans and i voted
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
for both sides of the aisle previously
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
it means that the voters are being heard
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
and our representatives must earn our
 
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
and our representatives must earn our
vote

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at new hampshire's
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
process of drawing the registry
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting maps this year
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
it is blatantly obvious that parity has
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
been left out of the process from the
 
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
been left out of the process from the
beginning

01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
some people have already mentioned
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
steven stefanik's
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
quotes from earlier this year in january
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
but i would like to reiterate
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
that this process should be a
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
non-partisan process of drawing
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
districts that will impact the
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislative makeup of our state for
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
years to come
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
a process that should be independent of
 
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
a process that should be independent of
politics

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative robert lynn of wyndham
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
you have revealed otherwise
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
last week in response thank you just be
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
sure that you're you are speaking to the
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
entire community not any one individual
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i apologize thank you thank
 
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.070 align:start position:0%
thank you i apologize thank you thank

you
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
so for the whole committee okay
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is not a political process it
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
should not be a political process
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
we are choosing you
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
please show me in the new hampshire
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
constitution or even the u.s
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
constitution where it says that you are
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to choose
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
who represents us
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
should not be a political process
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
we as your constituents have been asking
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
for parody and redistricting maps for
 
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
for parody and redistricting maps for
decades

01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
it is your duty to convince us that you
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
are the best candidates for the job
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
representing us and serving our needs
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
now talking about future prospects
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
myself personally
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
if the proposed majority congressional
 
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
if the proposed majority congressional
map

01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
will dictate the next 10 years of my
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
life and my future family's life
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
nervous while you only have to be
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about if your party is going
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
to win the elections of the next decade
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about if my school
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
district my children's school district
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
is going to have enough funding for my
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
children to be sufficiently nurtured and
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
cared for
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
because we do not have enough money in
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about if the effects of
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
climate change are going to negatively
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
impact my life and my family's
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
well-being because we are not prepared
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
for something we see coming straight for
 
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.189 align:start position:0%
for something we see coming straight for
us

01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about the church being
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to dictate my health and
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
personal decisions in the state where we
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
pride ourselves on living for your dying
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about if i lose my job
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
and need help to feed my family will my
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
state support me until i can get back on
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
my feet
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about if my elected
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
officials who are supposed to serve me
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the rest of new hampshire are going
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
to pass legislation that we need that
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
will help us grow and succeed
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
or if we are going down the rabbit hole
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
of the race to the bottom except this
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
time the bottom of democracy and morals
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
i have to worry about the next decade
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
because this year's redistricting
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
process has been a partisan
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
bastardization of the democratic process
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the majority committee members we are
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
not incompetent we see what you are
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
doing you do not have to look closely to
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
see that you are cheating your way to an
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
elected position to a guaranteed seat
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
from cd1
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee as a whole we have come
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
to you with open arms asking for you to
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
let us help with this process that we
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
care so deeply about we offered
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
non-partisan non-biased technology and
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
platforms to come to a fair non-partisan
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting pro
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
plan that will represent new hampshire
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
haven't really delivered
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not a fan of either map but
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
the majority map
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
breaking the constitution
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
where are we at why are we here
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
at this point i feel incredibly
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised as a voter and as an
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
active member of the state
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
i only hope the majority members of this
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee can realize a lack of
 
01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
committee can realize a lack of
equitable

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
and fair representation of this
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
redistricting process and redress your
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
actions before these maps are made law
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
i urge you to reconsider seriously the
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
maps proposed by open democracy the maps
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we have so clearly stated that we
 
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
that we have so clearly stated that we
want

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and your
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
consideration and please take into
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
consideration my future here
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for letting me speak
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
tonight uh my name is kirsten hugger
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah you need to
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
kirsten hugger
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
thanks we want to make sure that the
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
as most people probably in this room
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
probably know governor sununu vetoed a
 
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.709 align:start position:0%
probably know governor sununu vetoed a
bill

01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
to create an independent redistricting
 
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.709 align:start position:0%
to create an independent redistricting
commission

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
he said in his veto and i quote new
 
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
he said in his veto and i quote new
hampshire

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
has a redistricting process that is fair
 
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
has a redistricting process that is fair
representative

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
and accountable to its voters he also
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
said gerrymandering in the state is rare
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
so imagine my dismay
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
when the very first round of maps that
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
came out
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
following his
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say three points to
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering that have already been
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
said here tonight but i think that
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
they're worth reiterating number one
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering aggravates partisan
 
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.550 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering aggravates partisan
divide

01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
divide
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
most that when you have a gerrymandered
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
district the most important election
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
becomes the primary with the main
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
election being secondary
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
this encourages
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
politicians to drift to extremes and
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
worsens the partisanship in our state
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
competition among political candidates
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
ensures that new hampshire voter
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
concerns are being heard and addressed
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
if there's no threat of losing a seat
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
there is no incentive to respond to
 
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
there is no incentive to respond to
voters

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
and number three gerrymandering is
 
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
and number three gerrymandering is
anti-democratic

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
anti-democratic
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
if results are nearly predicted people
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
become discouraged they have less
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
incentive to vote and they have less
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
incentive to participate because they'll
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
feel their vote is being wasted
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters should choose their
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
representatives not the other way around
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire voices deserve to not
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
be silenced by gerrymandering thank you
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
before i get to the meat of my testimony
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
i want to acknowledge the many granite
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
staters who due to disability lack of
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
transportation options or job
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities do not have the
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make oral testimony due
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
to the lack of any remote testimony
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
option for this session
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
i thank you for providing the
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for input but providing it
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
in such a limited context when we saw
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it is possible for remote testimony
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
to happen is both disappointing and a
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
giant step backwards for the
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
accessibility of our democracy
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
we all know pages of written testimony
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
in your committee inbox just don't quite
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
pack the same punch as oral testimony
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
my name is jules good and i'm the ward 4
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
select person in somersworth new
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire as an election official and
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
someone passionate about equal access to
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
voting i'm appalled by the proposed
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
majority congressional map
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
i want to start by saying that while i'm
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
obviously a human with my own political
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
views i am here in my capacity as an
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
advocate for equal voting rights for
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless of their party
 
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless of their party
affiliation

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
when districts are manipulated to create
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
guaranteed wins for one party
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
constituents in those districts lose
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
their freedom of choice and elected
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
officials lose incentive to be
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
accountable for their decisions in
 
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.229 align:start position:0%
accountable for their decisions in
office

01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
with no competition in a district
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
candidates of the majority party will be
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
less likely to actively listen to their
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
constituents needs because they no
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
longer feel that they have to win them
 
01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
longer feel that they have to win them
over

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you were an nba basketball star
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
playing one-on-one against a middle
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
school kid would you practice and train
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
as hard as you would if you knew you
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
were playing another nba athlete no
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
you'd probably feel safe and slack off
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
this means that a rigged map hurts
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
voters in both parties because the value
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
of a win is diminished for the majority
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood of earning a win is
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
significantly lowered for the minority
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
how am i as an election official
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to get your tituans excited
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
about voting and participating in
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
democracy if they are effectively
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
betting on a rigged game
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed majority map is
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the intelligence and
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
autonomy of voters in both parties and
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
good evening members of the committee
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
and madame chairwoman
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
first i want to thank the committee for
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
taking the time to listen
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
to voters at the public input sessions
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
but also tonight i hope you will take
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
the input you've heard and readjust the
 
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
the input you've heard and readjust the
plans

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i also thank you both for keeping the
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
city of franklin together
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
instead of dividing our awards
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
our award lines will need to be adjusted
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
but in the charter
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and a charter change by voters at our
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
next municipal elections our current
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
wards are 526 people different so it
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
will have to be adjusted i know this
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee made an assumption that ward
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
lines would be
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
as close to perfect as they can
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
equal wards in our city
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
would be hard because the river divides
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
one of our ward and to cross the river
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
and to change that i think ward one will
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
always keep a population which it
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently has of three thousand one and
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
one people
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important when we look
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
at the city ward lines that are impacted
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
by all of these
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
that many cities aren't lucky like the
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
city of franklin the city of claremont
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
is joined with croydon the city of
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
rochester ward 5 is joined with milton
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester gets less
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
representation than it deserves it
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
should have 34 representation not less
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
numbers than that
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
dover has joined
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
ward 4 with
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
durham lee and madbury
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
i think the summersworth one combined
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
with rollinsford is unavoidable because
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
of geography
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
has to be combined with another but
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
laconia ward six
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
in one plan joined with gilford or
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
gilmington or in another plan joined
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
with belmont or
 
01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:14.830 align:start position:0%
with belmont or
or

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
gilmington um
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth ward one is is divided with
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
newington and newcastle keane's ward two
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
and three have
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
when one plan with all alstead
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
marlow stoddard and sullivan
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
or in another plan combined with
 
01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
or in another plan combined with
um

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
marlboro and you've heard about concord
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
ward 4 with bo in concord ward 5 with
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
hopkinton but i do think it's really
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
important that this committee looks at
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
the maps and tries to keep the integrity
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
of cities together
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
as much as it possibly can and i
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
understand the complexities with some
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
cities having to amend their
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
charters the city of claremont will
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
amend their charter in two years as well
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
as somersworth so that will be done like
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the city of franklin after this
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee has done their work and so
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
those award lines will be adjusted
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
as somersworth adjusted them
 
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:10.830 align:start position:0%
as somersworth adjusted them
in

01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
2013 in their last charter change
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
so i think that that as you sort of keep
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
in mind city charter processes please
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind in keeping the cities
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
intact in in any way you possibly can
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill maddox
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
hi my name is william maddox i live in
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
amherst and i want to thank the house
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee for holding this
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and the previous hearings around
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
i want to point out it's
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
fortunate that those with serious health
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerns can't attend these meetings
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
remotely and be able to speak
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
very serious
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
epidemic a very serious health crisis
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
pendant epidemic is raging more than 30
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
people are dying each week in this state
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it's just common sense that access
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
be made by all means possible in this
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
very extraordinary situation
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
i want to remind you that amherst was
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
among 74 towns representing 560
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
868 granite staters who voted in favor
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
of a fair redistricting process in town
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
or city elections last spring
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
in amherst the warned article passed by
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
almost three to one margin
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
i expect it to not been the worst part
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
of a hundred year pandemic that count
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
would have been far higher
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
people are sick and tired of unfair maps
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
and gerrymandering but this apparently
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
does not matter to some members of this
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:52.229 align:start position:0%
does not matter to some members of this
committee

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
who essentially ignored the will of 561
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
thousand voters
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
a fair registering redistricting process
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
is important to me
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that republicans and democrats can
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
have a level playing field in our
 
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
have a level playing field in our
elections

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
but instead you have chosen to
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
gerrymander our two congressional
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
districts in the most radical change in
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
140 years
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
if i were a republican in house district
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
2 it'd be clear to me that my own party
 
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.910 align:start position:0%
2 it'd be clear to me that my own party
disenfranchised

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
my ability to vote on congressional
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
representation in a meaningful way
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going on with the
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire republican party
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
it seems the thrill of the insurrection
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
in january
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
where we almost lost our nation's
 
01:27:36.159 --> 01:27:37.270 align:start position:0%
where we almost lost our nation's
capital

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the major science denial around
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
stopping a deadly virus
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
has possibly altered your thinking and
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
rendered you incapable of putting your
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
own narrow interests above the will of
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
the people and what is best for healthy
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
and vibrant democracy
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
let this be an important civics lesson
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
for students who are trying to
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand how democracy works
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
and how it is undermined
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
shame on you
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering is unpatriotic
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's unamerican
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
and gerrymandering is cheering
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee i'm happy to be here again in
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
this chamber i wish it were under a
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
arise to speak against your proposed
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
congressional map by which you seemingly
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
stand firm
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
comparing the map with those which
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
became law over the last 149 years
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
reveals more than a bizarre departure
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
it reveals a flagrant plan to reduce the
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
value and political of influence
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
political influence of voters of your
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
own party
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
in order to guarantee a democrat cannot
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
win in congressional district one
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
you have been reminded of the following
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
quote by republican party chair steven
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
stepanek but it must be hurt again for
 
01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:08.830 align:start position:0%
stepanek but it must be hurt again for
its

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
audacity quote because of this
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
republican majority
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
we control
 
01:29:15.199 --> 01:29:16.790 align:start position:0%
we control
redistricting

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
i can stand here today and guarantee
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
that you will send a conservative that
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
we will send a conservative republican
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
to washington d.c as a congressperson in
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
2022 end quote
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
i remind you and the r shucks both
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
parties are guilty crowd
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire democrats have never
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
produced gerrymandered resisting maps
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
because they have never been the party

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
value of republican votes in order to

um
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in opposition to the

republican redistrict redistricting
 
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.669 align:start position:0%
republican redistrict redistricting
proposal

01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
that you're currently proposing
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
this undemocratic proposal takes a swing
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
district which should be the goal of any
 
01:31:53.199 --> 01:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
district which should be the goal of any
redistricting

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
in order to allow
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
people a realistic chance to elect the
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
best candidate and it turns it into a
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
republican stronghold
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is nothing short of an
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
abuse of power and an attack on our
 
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.030 align:start position:0%
abuse of power and an attack on our
democracy

01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
redistricting should not diminish the
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
belief that an individual's vote matters
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
that the voting process process isn't an
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
exercise in futility
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
a fair redistricting when necessary
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
should hold promise for candidates for
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
from any party to throw their hats into
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
the political ring
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
with a realistic possibility of winning
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
the support of the majority on election
 
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.310 align:start position:0%
the support of the majority on election
day

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
something i don't see happening with the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
republican plan
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
i'm also saddened to see our democracy
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
slipping away
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
driven by politicians more interested in
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
a political party and power
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
rather than in the representation of the
 
01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
rather than in the representation of the
people

01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
and rather than in fairness the american
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
ideals and the integrity of our
 
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
ideals and the integrity of our
democracy

01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
my hope is that there will be there will
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
emerge a final redistricting proposal
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
that looks at fair representation just
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
distribution of population geography
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
and balance
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
not unlike the democratic proposal
 
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.790 align:start position:0%
not unlike the democratic proposal
furthermore

01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
with this partisan proposal it has
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
become clear that the job of defining
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
congressional districts should no longer
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
be in the hands of a single party
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
rather it should be in the hands of an
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
independent committee
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
but first
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
this redistricting proposal should be
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
scrapped in favor of one that better
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
serves all new hampshire voters in their
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
selection of its representatives
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
one where our democracy will flourish
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me today and thank
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
my name is matthew gerding i am a city
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
councilor in somersworth i am here today
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
to strongly request that the committee
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
on the federal congressional district
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
maps being proposed by the republican
 
01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.110 align:start position:0%
maps being proposed by the republican
majority

01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
not only would the approval of these
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
congressional district maps be the most
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
dramatic change ever made to the new
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire congressional districts but
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
their passage would be an insult to me
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the city which i
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
represent under the majority's proposed
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
maps somersworth along with a number of
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
other communities would for the first
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
time ever be shifted from congressional
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
district 1 to congressional district 2
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
in what appears to be an attempt to
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
build a congressional district that is
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
highly democratic leaning
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and another that is highly republican
 
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.149 align:start position:0%
and another that is highly republican
leaning

01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
leaning
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
this is evident by the blatantly
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
partisan choices of the communities that
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
were shifted between districts there was
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
no conceivable regard for shared
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
location demographics or history
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
counties were broken apart including my
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
own of stratford county
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
neighbors were divided and school
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
districts were separated in this process
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that lines must be drawn
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere as we all do but to utilize a
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
one-town wide sliver to connect
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
democratic-leaning communities along the
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
easterly border of the state to the
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
remainder of the congressional district
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
2 seems a bit suspect to me
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly clear it seems that the
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
only concern when these maps were made
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
were the political makeups of these
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
communities i reference
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
in what world do residents of
 
01:35:43.199 --> 01:35:44.629 align:start position:0%
in what world do residents of

state and pittsburgh new hampshire at
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
the very top of our state share the same
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
demographic values and needs
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
though i may not know how or why this
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee felt that it could blatantly
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
gerrymander these maps what i do know
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
for certain is that somersworth and its
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
residents do not appreciate being used
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
as a pawn in some larger political power
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
grab by republicans
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
this shift in congressional districts
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
would work to silence my constituents by
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
politicians who likely don't care much
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
about somersworth
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
they care about their own scramble for
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
power i certainly hope that it is not
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly not the case that party
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
leaders are so hungry for power that
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
party ideology would trump the needs of
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
towns cities school districts and most
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
importantly the people of new hampshire
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
this is not the new hampshire i thought
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
i lived in and i hope it has not been
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
forgotten who government serves
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
i would be embarrassed to see these
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
majority maps passed
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire to steep to the low
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
point of gerrymandering and electing
 
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.350 align:start position:0%
point of gerrymandering and electing
rigging

01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
rigging
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think that we are better than this and
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
i think that you are better than this
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
good evening chairwoman members of the
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
to speak tonight i know a lot of folks
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing process last
 
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.550 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing process last
month

01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
spoke very clearly to the need for this
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity and i'm grateful for
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
each and every member's
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
service to our state although this
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
process is pushing that to the brink
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh we did not have to be here
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the past three years there have been
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan efforts to introduce an
 
01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
bipartisan efforts to introduce an
advisory

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
which would have at least allowed
 
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.390 align:start position:0%
which would have at least allowed
for

01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.669 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
a more perfect process nothing is ever
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
perfect but allowing for
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
independents republicans and democrats
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
to come together to draw a map but those
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
maps were rejected excuse me that
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
process was rejected
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
opponents some of which
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
sit on this committee
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
said why would we allow non-elected
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
granite staters to make decisions when
 
01:38:09.199 --> 01:38:10.310 align:start position:0%
granite staters to make decisions when
we

01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
how do you remain accountable to the
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
people when you as politicians go behind
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
closed doors and decide who those voters
 
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
closed doors and decide who those voters
are

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
my friends and family understand that i
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
follow these processes very closely
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
so since chairman stepanek's comments
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
back in january
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
they would ask me how bad will it be
 
01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
they would ask me how bad will it be
luke

01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
luke
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
how bad will these maps be
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
they're worse than i could have imagined
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to take my word for
 
01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to take my word for
it

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
acclaimed new hampshire professor dante
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
scala worked with a research assistant
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
to try and draw what he characterized as
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
the most republican maps possible and he
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
fell short
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
these maps present a very clear threat
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
and you can hear in the testimony from
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
my fellow granite staters that they
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
understand this threat they feel it to
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
their core it makes them emotional it
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
makes me emotional
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a threat
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the bedrock of our democracy free and
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
fair elections
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
there are members of this committee
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
who will say
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
and support
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
anti-voter bills under the guise of
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
election integrity
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
i can think of no greater tyranny
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
i can think of no greater example of
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
undermining the integrity of our
 
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
undermining the integrity of our
elections

01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
of our voters
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
the message is clear the message is
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
redundant reject these maps
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying you have to adopt the
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
democrats proposal but have some common
 
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
democrats proposal but have some common
sense

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
because what these maps represent
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
is the threat that our state will lose
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
that ability to find consensus
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
to find common sense and to bring people
 
01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.709 align:start position:0%
to find common sense and to bring people
together

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
so i implore i beg
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
reconsider these maps go back to the
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
drawing board and produce something
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room can be proud of
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to give
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and and yes thank you for
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
the countless hours that you put into
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
at the listening sessions that i
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
attended the most frequent request i
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard was that towns meeting the
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
population requirement be guaranteed
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
their unique representative as
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
stipulated in the new hampshire
 
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.310 align:start position:0%
stipulated in the new hampshire
constitution

01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
with the house of representatives that
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
numbers 400 it seems we should be able
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
to achieve the goal of our original
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
founders that
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
at least as close as possible each
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
minute municipality should have its own
 
01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
minute municipality should have its own
representative

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
the open democracy mapathon team's
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
analysis by county showed how many
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
violations each set of maps had and a
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
violation meant a town not getting its
 
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.709 align:start position:0%
violation meant a town not getting its
constitutionally

01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
guaranteed or hoped for
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh independent
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative so i'm not gonna go
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
through the whole table here which will
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
be in the testimony i'm gonna put on
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
your website but um
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
for example belknap the majority map
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
eight violations so eight towns that
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a representative that isn't
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would have been entitled to it but
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
on the mapathon map five towns so that's
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
more striking
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
majority map
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
seven violations mapathon map four
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
difference of three so
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
going down and adding those columns
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.109 align:start position:0%
there are
16

01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
16
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
more total
 
01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
more total
violations

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
violations
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
in the majority maps than the mapathon
 
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.070 align:start position:0%
in the majority maps than the mapathon
maps

01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
keeping with the maps that have just
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
that five percent deviation if you go to
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the 15 percent deviation there's
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually a difference of 22 towns so
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's about a third of the violations
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
could have been reduced by coming up
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
with a different map in this case the
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
mapathon map so i'm not saying
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
precisely that's the map to use but it
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
shows at least that it can be done that
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
we do not need to
 
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.590 align:start position:0%
we do not need to
disenfranchise

01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise
 
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise
unconstitutionally

01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
61 towns from having their own
 
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.189 align:start position:0%
61 towns from having their own
representative

01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
and i worry also that that then becomes
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps a matter for litigation if the
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
maps should be adopted
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm from durham new hampshire
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to play a little game
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could call it jeopardy
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh what do you call it when uh
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
a map that appears
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
seems to confer
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
advantages to those who make the map
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
what do you call it
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
when the map manipulates and protects
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
certain party lines
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
what do you call it
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
when the map decreases one group's
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
voting strength
 
01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.149 align:start position:0%
voting strength
or

01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
oh i'm so sorry just get a little closer
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
or reduces values of the votes in an
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
isolated way
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
what do we call it when politicians pick
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
the voters versus the voters picking the
 
01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:08.070 align:start position:0%
the voters versus the voters picking the
politicians

01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
what do we call it when people are
 
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.510 align:start position:0%
what do we call it when people are
disenfranchised

01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
and their votes have less impact
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
what do we call it when one party takes
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
unfair political advantage
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
what do we call it when the districts
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
are rigged and maps are creating
 
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.270 align:start position:0%
are rigged and maps are creating
uh

01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
an entrenchment of a majority party
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think we know what we call it we call
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
it gerrymandering thank you
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%

important so participation in the
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
process up to this point
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.239 --> 01:45:51.590 align:start position:0%

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking tonight
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
to you tonight in my capacity as a
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative first as your colleague
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
but then again as a lawyer second
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
gosh i have a duty to inform you as the
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative for hanover and lyme that
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
hanover warrant article
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
number 27
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
as a resolution in our town meeting for
 
01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:18.790 align:start position:0%
as a resolution in our town meeting for
2021

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
successfully passed
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
states that my community demands that
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
this process result in a fair and
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
effective representation of new
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
and that independent redistricting
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
commission should draw these maps in a
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
way that does not rely on partisan data
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
like election results
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
party registration or favor political
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
party candidates or candidates
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
obviously we've missed that independent
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
second i have a duty to inform you as a
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer and as your colleague
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
you are in trouble
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
good thing you're sitting down
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
tell the ag's office to get their staff
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys ready because you guys are
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
going to be in for a litigation fight
 
01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
going to be in for a litigation fight
this

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
i mean let's let's just face it this
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
proposal is extreme
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
if it's adopted in its current form it's
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
proposed by the majority of this
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee you're
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
ripe for litigation and you're giving
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
lots of ammunition to the opposition
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
first of all the process
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
your pre-hearing notice process lacked
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
enough time for people to adequately
 
01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.550 align:start position:0%
enough time for people to adequately
participate

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh it also
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
lacked access there are plenty of folks
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
who could not participate because there
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
was no remote option
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
and you're denying those who cannot be
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
there because of elder care child care
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
health care
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
work arrangements to participate
 
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.870 align:start position:0%
work arrangements to participate
meaningfully

01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
meaningfully
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
you drop the ball
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
now that's just the pre-hearing concerns
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about post-hearing
 
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.149 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about post-hearing
concerns

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
i've yet to see an authentic
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
transparency of your map drawing process
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
from the majority
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
i implore you to publish
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
the gis shape files
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
sought by constituents to see the level
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
of granularity needed to evaluate your
 
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.550 align:start position:0%
of granularity needed to evaluate your
maps

01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned about
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know the issue of a report detailing
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
what you've learned at those public
 
01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
what you've learned at those public
hearings

01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not you took that information
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
into consideration and drawing your maps
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't take it into
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
consideration why that did not happen
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
the public has a right to know the
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
decision-making process that leads us up
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
proposed map
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
they also deserve to know why you're
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
gosh you're ripe for litigation because
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
of your methodology as well these maps
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
reveal that the committee majority was
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
unable to avoid the dangerous abuses
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
that were so enticing when drawing these
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
new lines
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
simply put
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
these maps and in particular the
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
congressional maps
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
that are proposed are packed and cracked
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
your large cities and towns are packed
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
together your small communities are
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
cracked apart
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
gosh you're robbing all of these
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
constituents a real chance at real
 
01:49:19.199 --> 01:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
constituents a real chance at real
representation

01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're ripe for litigation because it's
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
a severe breach
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
of following legal statutory
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
daniel webster said
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
the right to choose a representative is
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
every man's portion of sovereign power
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
you may have heard that in the burling
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
versus speaker of the house case from
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
our supreme court in 2002.
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
gosh experts have already stated their
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
astonishment with these maps
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
you've got experts on the record before
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the maps are published telling you
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're destroying
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
any reflection of polling that's out in
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the public realm or any political public
 
01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.430 align:start position:0%
the public realm or any political public
opinion

01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
you have been given clear warning that
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
people are demanding an independent fair
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
map and a good process and you're
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
part two articles nine and eleven of our
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution speak to the
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
serious of your job at task and the
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
rules that guide you in this
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know particularly that each 344
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
people should result in a seat for a
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
town or multi-municipal
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
municipal area across the state so that
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
each person's vote has equal weight
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not creating competitive
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
congressional districts with these maps
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
despite the 150 years of political
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
tradition in our state
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
and despite the de minimis population
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
shifts that have resulted from the
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
gosh you're running counter to the
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court of the united states and
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
the 1965 reynolds versus sims case which
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
stood for the guiding principle one
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
person one vote
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
not to mention the equal protection
 
01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
not to mention the equal protection
clause

01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
gosh you guys
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have all sorts of claims
 
01:51:24.159 --> 01:51:25.109 align:start position:0%
you're going to have all sorts of claims
about

01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
minority discrimination as a result of
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
these congressional maps for the sec
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
like the southern side of the state
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in trouble there
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
gosh all right well so we're looking at
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns a lot of them
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
you are my client
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'd tell you you need to reassess your
 
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.350 align:start position:0%
i'd tell you you need to reassess your
position

01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
the consequences of gerrymandering are
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to propose irreparable harmonic
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
communities if they're enacted this way
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to divide our political
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
parties by furthering
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know favoring one party
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
in power at the expense of the minority
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
worse yet it's going to give one party a
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
majority in the state house or a seat in
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
congress despite only winning a minority
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the votes
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
politicians again are picking their
 
01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.750 align:start position:0%
politicians again are picking their
voters

01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
not the other way around this is
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
undemocratic and deeply unpatriotic
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
ask yourself
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
what is the long-term political
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
consequence for your party for our state
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
for the voters
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
if these maps are enacted into law
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're hurting our neighbors
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
their voting rights by invalidating
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
their votes they're hurting our children
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
in their schools
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
and they're disproportionately affecting
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
people of color in this state
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to split school districts
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
traffic flows fire departments
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
communities of interest and the list
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's a warning
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to warn you
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
democratic minority maps are reasonable
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
they're competitive
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
they honor our state's tradition
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
as well as compliance they also comply
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
with the supreme court of our united
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
states as well as the constitution of
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't adopt the minority maps
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
and you move to enact these majority
 
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
and you move to enact these majority
maps

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
attention and litigation will fall upon
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
do not let new hampshire become the next
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
battleground in courts over
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%

and the aclu
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
will follow they will be ready and they

01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's a scandal it will be
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%

strictly by the taxpayers burden
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's also going to attract adverse media
 
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.470 align:start position:0%
it's also going to attract adverse media
coverage

01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
yet again it will be another extreme
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
political issue in the national media
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
showing that the granite state
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
because of our current leadership
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
will this extreme power grab be the
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
straw that finally breaks the camel's
 
01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.270 align:start position:0%
straw that finally breaks the camel's
back

01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
causing our beloved electorate the
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
time-honored tradition of voting
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
this will have dire consequences to our
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
citizens if we lose it
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
ask yourself if you want to be
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
you will be held accountable if so by
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
most important i have a question for
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
at a time when public confidence in
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
government is at an all-time low if this
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
committee creates a pre-ordained outcome
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire gop leadership
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
to deprive the voters of any meaningful
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
influence in the next election with
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
these proposed majority maps
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
are you the committee prepared to own
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
to rob these americans of their most
 
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental way of participating in our
 
01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.750 align:start position:0%
fundamental way of participating in our
democracy

01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
this will have severe consequences for
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
our government our institutions and our
 
01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
our government our institutions and our
society

01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the very american experiment itself is
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative i'm going to need to ask
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
you to wrap it up
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you political theorist alexis de
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
tocqueville always thought that america
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
was making a big mistake by allowing the
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
everyday jefferson yeoman
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
this frenchman political elitist
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
missed it but our founding fathers
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
understood better
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
that everyday americans had the ability
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
to fill their civic duties and to vote
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
to determine who we are and what we will
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
be what common good we will achieve
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
heed our founding fathers calls
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
honor free and fair elections and do not
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
put yourself in a position for the
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
potential litigation that will follow
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
and against our founding fathers wishes
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%

hello
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee thank you
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
for hearing our testimony today
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
my name is nicholas macri and i'm a
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
resident of hanover and a student and
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
employee of dartmouth college
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
as you decide the new district
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
boundaries for our state's congressional
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
districts i implore you to reject the
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee majority's proposed districts
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
which are gerrymandered that seeks to
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
remove democracy from the selection of
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's representatives in
 
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:08.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's representatives in
congress

01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
congress
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
i will uh admit that i showed up to this
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
hearing five minutes late because there
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
is no remote option
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
i do not have a car i had to arrange
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
transportation to concord
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
um so maybe i missed it but i have not
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
heard a single person in this hearing
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
support your majorities maps
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
not a single person
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
everybody here has been saying the exact
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
same thing you know what i'm going to
 
01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:36.550 align:start position:0%
same thing you know what i'm going to
say

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
you know what everybody after me is
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
this has a very strong feeling of
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
procedural democracy
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're all standing here we're all
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
begging you to not do this
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
to allow us to have competitive
 
01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.229 align:start position:0%
to allow us to have competitive
elections

01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
for the past decade the first district
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
has flipped back and forth between
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats rightfully so
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
because not the same party should have
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
power all the time
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
if our voters think that the other party
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
should be in power they should have the
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
this map is taking that away
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to have
 
01:58:20.070 --> 01:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
a map designed to elect a democrat in
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
a republican in district 1 for the next
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
why should we even bother to participate
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
why should we vote
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
why are we all here at this hearing
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
it it just makes us feel like this is a
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
hopeless process
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
like our elections are predetermined
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
and that for the next decade we won't
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
really have a choice we're going to show
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
up to the polling station we're going to
 
01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:50.709 align:start position:0%
up to the polling station we're going to
vote

01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
but this map was drawn for a purpose it
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
was drawn to create a predetermined
 
01:58:54.639 --> 01:58:56.629 align:start position:0%
was drawn to create a predetermined
outcome

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'm in the second district
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the past our district has been more
 
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.790 align:start position:0%
in the past our district has been more
competitive

01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
this map will not
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
continue that it will make it more
 
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.229 align:start position:0%
continue that it will make it more
democratic

01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
it will
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know why why even hold a general
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
election if we know what the outcome is
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be like this
 
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
there is the minorities proposal they've
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
drawn a map that has made the minimal
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
changes possible
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure the populations are equal
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
and to keep towns and cities together
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
we can update our maps to the change of
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
the population that's what this
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting hearing is for
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
this majority map as everybody has said
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
has completely moved you know
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
dozens of towns
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
can you articulate a reason why
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of completely
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
redrawing the map other than
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
the explicit political reasons that
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
that party chairman that we've heard so
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's quite depressing to think that
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
that our elections could be
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
predetermined in this way i think we all
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to participate
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
we all are asking you to allow us to
 
02:00:17.119 --> 02:00:17.990 align:start position:0%
we all are asking you to allow us to
keep

02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the choice that we have
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
currently we have very competitive maps
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
we have the ability
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
to have representatives fight to keep
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
their jobs they're not assuming that
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to win
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not ignoring constituents
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
because they know that they don't really
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
need to work hard to campaign
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
we should not adopt the majority's map
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
every single person in this room is
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
asking you not to do that
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
please listen to us please
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
you have the power to prevent this
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
like other people said you don't need to
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
adopt the democratic map
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason to draw such an
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
absurd gerrymander for for no reason
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
detached from politics
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're all begging you
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
please don't do this
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for making the
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
effort to come down
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%

02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
my wife and i have lived in hudson and
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
worked in nashua for more than the past
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
three decades
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
consequently it seems obvious to us
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's a certain community of interest
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
between those two communities
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
and therefore i was disappointed to
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
learn that the majority has put forth a
 
02:01:49.599 --> 02:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
learn that the majority has put forth a
plan

02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
that would kick my town of hudson into
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
some new district
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
along with many other communities into
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
some new district
 
02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
some new district
to

02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
to
achieve

02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
some result that that
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
is difficult for me to get my my my head
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
around and
 
02:02:09.119 --> 02:02:10.310 align:start position:0%
around and
it

02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that
 
02:02:12.639 --> 02:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that
although

02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
although
 
02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:14.629 align:start position:0%
although
my

02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:02:14.639 --> 02:02:15.669 align:start position:0%
my
personal

02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
personal
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
little grievance about where my hometown
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
is is going to wind up if the majority's
 
02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:21.669 align:start position:0%
is is going to wind up if the majority's
maps

02:02:21.669 --> 02:02:21.679 align:start position:0%
maps
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
were adopted occurred to me that that's
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
really not the important question for me
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly not the important question
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the representatives to ask
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
it strikes me that
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
all the representatives should be going
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
should be asking themselves
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
when they go to their communities when
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
when you talk to your families
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
when you talk to your neighbors when you
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
talk to your constituents
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
do they tell you that what we really
 
02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
do they tell you that what we really
need

02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
is greater polarization
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
do they tell you that the one thing we
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
really need is more
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
partisanship because if they tell you
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
that what they want
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
is a plan
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
that will
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
be designed to maximize the ideological
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
distance between the two representatives
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the that this state sends to
 
02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
that the that this state sends to
congress

02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
congress
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
well then job well done
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
but that's not what i think
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what i'm hearing in
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
my community so i ask you is that what
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
you're hearing in your community
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
the other important question to ask is
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
that if you believe
 
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
that your party
 
02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.109 align:start position:0%
that your party
has

02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
the ideals the values the agenda
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
shared by the majority of the citizens
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
of this state then surely what you want
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
is a
redistricting

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
process that yields a relatively
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
even distribution of democratic
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
democrats and republicans because when
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
you skew the districts so that one liens
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
democrat and the other ring leans
 
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
democrat and the other ring leans
republican

02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
republican
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
what you're doing
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
is you're giving up
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
on one of the districts you're writing
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
it off
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
if your values are the values of this
 
02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
if your values are the values of this
state

02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you'd want to go for two
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
that you'd want to give yourself the
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
best shot
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
at electing folks of like mind to both
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
of our congress congressional districts
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the way to do that
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
is to give us
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
fair maps
 
02:04:34.719 --> 02:04:38.310 align:start position:0%
fair maps
alternatively

02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
ask yourself whether your party
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
is so
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
out of sync with the majority of the
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
citizens of this state
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
with the majority of your neighbors that
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
the only way that you can possibly elect
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
even one
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
congress person to the to the united
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
states congress is to have a skewed map
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
and if your answer the question is yes
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
then the question i would leave you with
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
is under what ethical system can that
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
so i i'll leave you with a request
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
have a little faith
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
please have faith
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the citizens of the state of new
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire have faith in your friends
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
your neighbors your constituents have a
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
little faith in the democratic process
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
and give us fair maps
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't have my mic on also signed
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
up to speak is is roy schweiker from
 
02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:53.109 align:start position:0%
up to speak is is roy schweiker from
concord

02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker
 
02:05:57.119 --> 02:05:58.629 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker
and

02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't see the big deal about why it's
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
bad to move people
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
from one district to another it makes
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
the districts better
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think you've heard a lot about how the
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
majority plan looks like it's
 
02:06:11.599 --> 02:06:12.870 align:start position:0%
majority plan looks like it's
gerrymandered

02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to look at the minority
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
plan it also looks like it's
 
02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.109 align:start position:0%
plan it also looks like it's
gerrymandered

02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
i mean both of them are wacky
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
we have concord and nashua in the same
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
district and manchester halfway between
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
and a different district this is just
 
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.189 align:start position:0%
and a different district this is just
outrageous

02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
outrageous
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
and if you want to talk about
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
communities of interest i'd say let's
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
group the whole southern tier together
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
we had someone say that it was bad to
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
put keene pittsburgh and somersworth in
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
the same district well i say that those
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
three communities have far more in
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
common than they have with salem and
 
02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.270 align:start position:0%
common than they have with salem and
nashua

02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to suggest is you throw
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
out both of these plans
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you pick land far more rational
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
you have one district that's essentially
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
hillsborough and rockingham counties
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's system with the smsa
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
spreading over from massachusetts it's a
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of towns that have common
 
02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.030 align:start position:0%
bunch of towns that have common
interests

02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
interests
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that numerically that's
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
actually a very good fit
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
and if you want it to be a better fit
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
you can shed a few towns
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
from rockingham county and hillsborough
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
county into the other district but
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know you can pick towns that may
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
have more community with that district
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
so i think that instead of splitting
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
what is it seven counties you could get
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
by with splitting zero counties if you
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
think that number works you could
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
certainly get by splitting only one
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
county and most split two counties
 
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.229 align:start position:0%
county and most split two counties
and

02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a very consistent setup and it
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
works numerically and it works with a
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
community of interests so i think we
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
should throw out both these plans for
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
the congressional districts and do
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
something to make common sense
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
and as far as the
 
02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.669 align:start position:0%
and as far as the
county

02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative districts
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
i think i do agree with the people that
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
once again let's change things if it
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
makes it better there's no reason that
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the city of concord should be sharing
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
representatives with beau and hopkinton
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
they should have their own set of
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
representatives so from that perspective
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
i would say let's do the concord
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
representatives like the minority plan
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
to keep concord together as far as the
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
rest of the communities
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for them i don't
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
know if they would like the majority or
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
minority thing better but certainly
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
concord should have its own set of
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
representatives independent of bowen
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
hopkins thank you
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak from new london as
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
is nancy
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
nancy you know what i i'm about to do so
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
remind me please how to pronounce your
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
last name
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
nancy moragio from new london
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh a past select board member would
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
always advise us at meetings
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to hear compliments and
 
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.149 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to hear compliments and
complaints

02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
compliments first
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i want to start with a compliment
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have changed the process
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
of redistricting by
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
honoring people and coming out to the
 
02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
honoring people and coming out to the
counties

02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
you coming to them
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
and allowing the testimony to happen
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
that way
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
you've also changed it by what you're
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
doing tonight
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
i remember a time when there was a
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
hearing after the maps were drawn but
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
the maps were not available to the
 
02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.069 align:start position:0%
the maps were not available to the
public

02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
so we had a hearing nothing to talk
 
02:09:32.079 --> 02:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
so we had a hearing nothing to talk
about

02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that aspect of the process also
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
is wonderful that you've done
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i hope both of those processes
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
continue in the future
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
because it honors the voters and it
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
a complaint is that
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know the standards you all used
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
we don't know if democrats and
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
republicans use the same ones
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know if the standards across
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
the various kinds of maps are the same
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
and it would be useful to know those
 
02:10:08.719 --> 02:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
and it would be useful to know those
standards

02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
a compliment
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know the fair max
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
maps coalition of four
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
non-partisan organizations
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
has done a great deal of work
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for paying attention to
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
that work
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
we had experts drawing maps
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
you paid attention to those
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
we had a new category of standard
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
which provided a huge amount of
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
insight in fact they did surveys 60
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions i think on the surveys of many
 
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
questions i think on the surveys of many
communities

02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
to unearth
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
various communities of interest i want
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
to use as an example um
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
new london my town and newbury my former
 
02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.629 align:start position:0%
new london my town and newbury my former
town

02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
for example the survey on earth that
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
they share assessors
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
well that matters
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
it also shows us how to look at the maps
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i would recommend for new london
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
that you use
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
the minority map puts new london with
 
02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.310 align:start position:0%
the minority map puts new london with
danbury

02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
danbury
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
thinking of communities of interest
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
danbury is in a different regional
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
planning commission
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
new london is in the kirsaj district
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
things like that matter when you have a
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative trying to look at the
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
range of the communities they work with
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
newberry who we've been with for 10
 
02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
newberry who we've been with for 10
years

02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
has the same kind of problem on the
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
minority map
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
it puts us back with henniker
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard my anecdote before
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
when we were put with henniker the first
 
02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
when we were put with henniker the first
time

02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
one of the people running for office in
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
henniker happened to come
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
to the town office and library the same
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
time i was there
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
and she said
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
oh what a lovely town i've never been
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
here before
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
that is not the kind of representation
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
you want
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
i would also like to share that the
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
select boards of of new london and
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
newbury both met on monday
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
agreeing um to send you official letters
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
asking that you keep that district
 
02:12:37.679 --> 02:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
asking that you keep that district
together

02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
standard of communities of interest is
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
a negative
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i say this is a new hampshire native
 
02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.669 align:start position:0%
and i say this is a new hampshire native
the

02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.679 --> 02:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
congressional district
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
that was drawn by the majority
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
will probably go down in textbooks if
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
you pass it as one of the worst examples
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
of gerrymandering ever
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see that as a new
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire native please reconsider thank
 
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.069 align:start position:0%
hampshire native please reconsider thank
you

02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%

madam chair members of the committee
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%

thank you for your efforts and for this
opportunity

02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity

pretty much everybody that's gone before
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
me has said what i wanted to say i
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%

am here to speak in opposition of
uh

02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
uncompetitive districts
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
and what we see here is uncompetitive
 
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
and what we see here is uncompetitive
districts

02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
i think we know that democracy is
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
fragile and this map would be unhelpful
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
in strengthening it
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
electing representatives from the
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
margins will only further divide our
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
state and our country
 
02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:15.589 align:start position:0%
state and our country
and

02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
some examples of people that have been
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
elected from uncompetitive districts
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
alexandria ocasio-cortez
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
marjorie taylor green
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
rashida talib
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
jim jordan ayanna presley
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
and matt goetz
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
so that's something to think about uh
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
when you sit down to
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully reevaluate re-evaluate this
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
said what i came here to say so i'm not
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
going to belabor the point
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%

thank you for
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
as this gentleman said
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
the people who've already spoken i agree
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much that they were much more
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
eloquent than i am
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
i spoke to you
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
or some of you
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the goffstown high school
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
some of you
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
were there some of you weren't
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
some of you
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
were here i think all of you were here
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday as i was
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
and there were over 35 people i think
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
who spoke
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh several of you took me uh
 
02:16:13.119 --> 02:16:14.229 align:start position:0%
uh several of you took me uh
notes

02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
notes
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
several of you had the maps out and when
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
people talked about
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh the different towns and they didn't
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
seem to make sense or have communities
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
of interest i saw several of you write
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
that down
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
several of you said
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
from was it 10 to 12 or 12 30 didn't
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
take a break
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
i noticed a few of you took more than
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
one break
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
i noticed some of you didn't take
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
any minutes or notes
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
i noticed some of you didn't even have
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
papers in front of you
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
so it was interesting
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
but back to uh the meeting at in
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
goffstown high school
 
02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:53.850 align:start position:0%
at that time i gave you
 
02:16:53.850 --> 02:16:55.349 align:start position:0%
at that time i gave you
[Music]

02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:55.359 --> 02:16:56.549 align:start position:0%
[Music]
a

02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:16:56.559 --> 02:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
a
outline

02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
outline
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
of all the towns in hillsboro and i had
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
written down their population
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
and at the time i had had said that gee
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
so many of these little towns were
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
getting so many
 
02:17:11.439 --> 02:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
getting so many
reps

02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
reps
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i suggested maybe you could look
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
into that
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
i guess the ideal
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
the ideal population is 3444
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
people for for one rep
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i apologize there were a few errors
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
the list i
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
but briefly
 
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.830 align:start position:0%
but briefly

33.58
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
reps and the republicans have said well
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
32 should be enough for them
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
and put
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
give them eight floatarials within
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
as many of the people have said here
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
tonight many of the people who said
 
02:19:50.319 --> 02:19:52.230 align:start position:0%
tonight many of the people who said
yesterday

02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
and all the people who voted for an
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
we want fair maps
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
we'd like to know how you came up with
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
those maps
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
even with this committee uh when i was
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the meeting last week
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
one of you
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
put out that u.s congressional map
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
and said i did this i i figured this out
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
i figured this out for 15 minutes this
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
person said that they did this map
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden the person
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
changed said the committee did the map
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of interesting why all of a
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
sudden one person did the map then the
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee did the map
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire she submitted
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
maps to the public week for the rest of
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
you did
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
what's the process
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know did one of you do a map for a
 
02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
you know did one of you do a map for a
county

02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
and then the others just accept it
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure on the dem side of how
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
it was done
 
02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:56.830 align:start position:0%
it was done
um

02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
but you only have what next week to the
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
18th tomorrow is a holiday you have the
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
weekend so within four or five days
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're all going to say yes or no
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
as many of the people have said
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
go back work together
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
i know those deviations are a pain in
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the neck i've been trying to figure out
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
how to do deviations for the last couple
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
of days i think i finally figured it out
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the deviations and they're
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
1.15 well so what the town should have
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
its own rep
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't but yet it's got a good
 
02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:42.230 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't but yet it's got a good
deviation

02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's crazy
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i sympathize with you to a point
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
but but i just hope that you um
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
will take the time to give us fair maps
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you again for all your time
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman and
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee i i will be quick my name is
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
rebecca hutchinson i'm from deerfield
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i would like to speak to the issue
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
of the state rep districts and
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
particularly in rockingham county and i
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
hope i'm going to share a little detail
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
about what it means
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are in small towns
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
to have to share
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
our reps with other towns
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically i think both maps actually
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
put deerfield
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh in some kinds of combinations with
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
five other towns deerfield candy and
 
02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.870 align:start position:0%
five other towns deerfield candy and
nottingham

02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
nottingham
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh northwood and auburn
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i just would like to tell you that
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
in deerfield
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
over a hundred residents
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
signed a letter requesting our board of
 
02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
signed a letter requesting our board of
selectmen

02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
to advocate on our behalf to get our own
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
state rep
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
during this process
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
they did that
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
the five member date reps
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported the
 
02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported the
effort

02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
or the request that we had our own
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
state rep
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
i would i'd also like to tell you that
 
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
i would i'd also like to tell you that
the

02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
five members of our board are
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
republicans and independents there isn't
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
a democrat among them
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to share with you that
 
02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
and i want to share with you that
um

02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
those hundred people in our town who
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
requested that we
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
advocate strongly for our own state rep
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of those hundred people
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
was about 35 percent republican 33
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
independent and about 31 32 percent
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
democrat which
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
pretty accurately reflects
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the party affiliation in here
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
so my point that i want to make is that
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
there were more republicans
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
requesting our own state rep than the
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
other parties so
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
the question is why is there such a
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan call
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
for deerfield to have its own state rep
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
as we did
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
before 2002
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
deerfield is in two districts now i
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
think with the new ones it would also be
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
in two districts but i want to focus
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
on our experience with one of the
 
02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
on our experience with one of the
districts

02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
we are in a town we are in a three-town
 
02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:25.349 align:start position:0%
we are in a town we are in a three-town
district

02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
that elects
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
three state reps
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
so in
 
02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
so in
2018

02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
none of the three people who won
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
a district-wide seat
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually came in first
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
in their own town
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
two of them were from deerfield
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
one was from nottingham
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and none of them won in their own town
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
to make it worse
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
one of those who won district-wide
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
came in fourth
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
in our town
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
what is happening is people are getting
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
elected by the other
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
towns 2020 it was a little bit better
 
02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
towns 2020 it was a little bit better
slightly

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
the individual who won in deerfield
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
also won
 
02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:22.230 align:start position:0%
also won
statewide

02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
statewide
so

02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
we can say yeah that's
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
at least we are electing
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
someone we know and they and they won in
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same individual
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
from our town who came in fourth
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
in 2018 in our town also came in fourth
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
in our town
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
but was elected
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
by the district
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
so what is happening
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
is people
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
are getting elected
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
in by the other tenants
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
so it's not only that we don't get
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh to vote for a single representative
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
to represent deerfield it's actually
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
worse than that
 
02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
worse than that
because

02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.510 align:start position:0%
because
we

02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
people that the district elects people
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
that we know very well
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
and don't and reject time and time again
 
02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:19.030 align:start position:0%
and don't and reject time and time again
literally

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
literally
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have a rep
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
who has run for selectmen five times in
 
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
our town
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
and been rejected every time
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
we also have a rep who's run for school
 
02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:31.830 align:start position:0%
we also have a rep who's run for school
board

02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
i've actually lost count it's either
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
four or five times
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
and is always defeated
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
but they go to these multi-town
 
02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:41.110 align:start position:0%
but they go to these multi-town
districts

02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and they get elected
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's really frustrating
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
i believe i'm correct that both
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority maps
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
have five towns
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
in our area and again i repeat them
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're deerfield candy and nottingham
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
northwood and
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
auburn and i believe both of your maps
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
give us seven reps
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
each of those towns
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
is large enough to have its own state
 
02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
is large enough to have its own state
rep

02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
so you could
 
02:27:14.399 --> 02:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
so you could
give

02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
five reps to the five towns and do two
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
for materials and have the same number
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
but then we would actually have an
 
02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
but then we would actually have an
opportunity

02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
to elect people who represent us
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
we are tired
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
of rejecting people
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
because we know them well
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then have them elected by the other
 
02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
and then have them elected by the other
tents

02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
tents
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
now i suspect this happens in other
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
districts as well
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that for sure but i i
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
suspect that what does
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to be
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
so i would ask you again
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
to look at that concept of gathering
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
everybody who's possibly you know who's
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
got the right number of population their
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
own district and start from there thank
 
02:28:02.399 --> 02:28:06.870 align:start position:0%
own district and start from there thank
you

02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
i have kim and harold frost signed up
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
hi i'm kim frost and i live in netan new
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm a member of the league of
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
women voters of new hampshire and a
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire mapathon's
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
technical team
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
but the following testimony is my own
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
as you know the mapathon team has spent
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
the last several months collecting data
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
on communities of interest developing
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
criteria for evaluating maps and
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
drafting fair maps to share with the
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
public and with your committee
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that democracy depends upon a
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
a fair and open open redistricting
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
process and that voters should choose
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
their own representatives rather than
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
representatives choosing their voters
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
i attended the hearing last week when
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats on the
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee shared their redistricting
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
proposals for new hampshire's two
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
congressional seats
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative ross berry explained that
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
the rationale for the gop map was to
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
unite the communities in the southern
 
02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:19.670 align:start position:0%
unite the communities in the southern
tier

02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
tier
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
in particular the towns of hudson
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
windham litchfield pelham salem and
 
02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
windham litchfield pelham salem and
atkinson

02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
atkinson
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
into one congressional district
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
he explained that the proposed map was
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to do this
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
well this is of course a community of
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
interest we collected data on
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
communities of interest from over 200
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
participants and this particular coi was
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
not mentioned by anybody
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
participants in our nonpartisan process
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
identified the following cio cois listed
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
an order of priority
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
shared high school saus
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
shared water and sanitation services
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
shared police and fire services
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
shared public health regions communities
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
that high in social vulnerability as
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
identified by by new hampshire dhhs and
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
shared regional planning commissions
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
it turns out that representative barry's
 
02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
coi crosses boundaries for the counties
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the center at the southern tier
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
and for the public health region and
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
regional planning commission cois
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
it also does not have significant shared
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
high school saus water and sanitation
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
services police and fire services or
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities higher high in social
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerability that appear to connect the
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
whole all of those towns into a larger
 
02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:35.190 align:start position:0%
whole all of those towns into a larger
community

02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
as a result we had not previously taken
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative various coi into account
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
in our own analyses
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
being the dedicated data geeks that we
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
are however several members of our team
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
immediately set to work to see if
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative barry's coi could be
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
combined with these other cois to create
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
a map that responded to this hitherto
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
unknown coi and still respect the others
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and all of the other important
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting concerns such as low
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
deviation compactness competitiveness
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
splitting and preservation of the core
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
of of prior districts
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
five of us spent about 15 minutes each
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
creating alternative maps in dave's
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting software
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
each of us generated a map that
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
respected this new cli and had lower
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
deviation was more compact and
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
competitive split fewer counties and
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
fewer other communities of interest and
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
preserved more of the core of the prior
 
02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:33.510 align:start position:0%
preserved more of the core of the prior
districts

02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
i've attached these maps and their
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
associated analyses to my testimony and
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'll share that with you afterwards
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
if communities of interest are really
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
important to the new hampshire
 
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee i would re
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that they take
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
another look at the original mapathon
 
02:31:49.359 --> 02:31:50.469 align:start position:0%
another look at the original mapathon
proposal

02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:31:50.479 --> 02:31:51.190 align:start position:0%
proposal
um

02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
which which does a better job of
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
combining those communities of interest
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
or at alternative number one in the
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that i'm going to share with
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
you both of which do a much better job
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
with cois than the republican proposal
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
i noticed however that the
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
gop's proposed map is eerily similar to
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
the gerrymandered map published by 538
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
in january of 2018.
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
may i point out that the proposed map is
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
in fact the ideal gerrymandering
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
mandarin by either the republican
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
republicans or the democrats
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
i've also attached some analyses here by
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
538 that show that the current new
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire congressional districts are
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
highly competitive and proportionately
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
partisan and that gerrymandered maps
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
will result in two districts where the
 
02:32:42.309 --> 02:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
other party has less than a one in six
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
chance of winning an election
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
of course by this analysis if you
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
believe in competitive districts the
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
democrats proposal is a clear winner
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
as you all know and as you've heard here
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
before heavily heavily gerrymandered
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
maps such as the ones proposed by the
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
republicans on this committee will
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
create more extreme candidates for both
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
parties and drive us further apart
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
this is a terrible plan for the people
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
madam chairman committee
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:28.630 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
speak

02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i have any eloquence to
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
change anybody's mind
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
particularly at this late hour
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to go on record with my
 
02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.870 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to go on record with my
opinion

02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to put it like this
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
back in my high school american history
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
which is getting to be some time ago
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
the textbook explained to us how the
 
02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
the textbook explained to us how the
politicians

02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts the state to our south
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh created uh sort of a
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
slimy beast
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
looked like a salamander
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
and they called it a gerrymander
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
now this was not written up as an
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
example of good governance
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing that
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire generally look
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
down upon because
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
they expect their local government to be
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
honest and competent
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
rightly so
 
02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:34.150 align:start position:0%
rightly so
and

02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
imagine my surprise then to wake up one
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
morning recently
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
and see in my
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
morning newspaper
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the gerrymandered beast had
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
crawled up the merrimack river valley
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and was sitting in the middle
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
so let me explain it is your job as a
 
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.349 align:start position:0%
so let me explain it is your job as a
committee

02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
hi there
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
good evening madam chairwoman and
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
my name is christine fajardo
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to take
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
part in this important discussion and i
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that following the previous
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
round of public hearings were here
 
02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:40.950 align:start position:0%
round of public hearings were here
tonight

02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
and able to respond to actual maps which
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
you did make public
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
many people have described how unfair
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
maps impact cities towns and
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
constituents on an individual basis and
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are certainly no shortage of
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
details to remark upon
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to zoom out a little bit
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
and look at this for more of a macro
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
view and try to help answer the question
 
02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
view and try to help answer the question
of

02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
what the big picture impacts might be
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
keeping our districts fair doesn't just
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
have implications at the city town and
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
regional level it also stands to have
 
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
major implications for new hampshire at
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
the national level
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
unfair districts will damage new
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire's reputation as a leader and
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsible steward of our nation's
 
02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:25.590 align:start position:0%
responsible steward of our nation's
democracy

02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
our reputation as a small but mighty
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
state with the ability to drive
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
democratic outcomes through our first in
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
the nation primary
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
or unpredictably award our key electoral
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
votes because of our fiercely
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
independent voters
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
will be called into question
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
our status as leaders on the national
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
stage for how democracy could and should
 
02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
stage for how democracy could and should
function

02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
will be irreparably tarnished
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to begin with new hampshire will become
 
02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.710 align:start position:0%
to begin with new hampshire will become
predictable

02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
candidates will no longer venture over
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
the line into other parties territories
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
robbing granite staters of our
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
long-standing tradition of up close and
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
personal retail politics
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
we'll no longer have the benefit of
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
meeting candidates on our doorsteps
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
being courted as though our single vote
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
could make all the difference
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
instead we'll be seen as one of two
 
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.190 align:start position:0%
instead we'll be seen as one of two
monoliths

02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
monoliths
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
robbed of our individual individuality
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and independence
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will no longer be the
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
will no longer be leading the
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
conversation and instead will be pushed
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
off to the margins
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's credibility will be
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
permanently damaged instead of making
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
national headlines for again our small
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
but mighty state and all that we deliver
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
for this country and its democracy we're
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
now making national headlines for our
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
blatant flouting of it
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
some have argued that redistricting is
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry some have argued that
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
redrawing district lines is an
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
inherently political process
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore that might justify
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
diluting voices of voters but this isn't
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
passing the smell test beyond new
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's borders
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in states like nevada and
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
south carolina who already have concerns
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire's outsized impacts
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
on our national on the national stage
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
this would be a boon to their arguments
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and advantage them in their efforts to
 
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
override us
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
most critically new hampshire could
 
02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
become irrelevant
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
we won't have a leg to stand on when we
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
boast about our independence
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
our status as a swing state will be
 
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
replaced with a status that we are
 
02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.309 align:start position:0%
replaced with a status that we are
immovable

02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
immovable

we know the possibility of the
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
long-standing effects of these maps
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the disregard for
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
historical presidents precedents
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
we expected a political battle but are
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
we really prepared to sacrifice
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
everything that's important to us
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%

disenfranchise voters

the article
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
was trying to point out
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of spotting
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%

02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it went on to talk about some of the
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
ways that were then being considered to
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
really be able to get a hold of
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%

02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to draw these maps and
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
roughly speaking they're of two types
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
is trying to do german mandarin but make
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
it look like it's not
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
so it looks sort of respectable
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
are taking the course
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
of really trying to make it
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that it is not gerrymandered
 
02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:58.230 align:start position:0%
so that it is not gerrymandered
um

02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
texas for example
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
has used the one
 
02:41:02.399 --> 02:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
has used the one
that

02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to make it sort of look
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
respectable but is a horrible example of
 
02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.950 align:start position:0%
respectable but is a horrible example of
gerrymandering

02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.950 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
and

02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:13.670 align:start position:0%
and
i

02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
am thinking that we should be trying
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
to use one
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
that really avoids gerrymandering
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
and many of the speakers i think have
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
spoken very well
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
about why
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:33.330 align:start position:0%
it's important that we have
 
02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:34.630 align:start position:0%
it's important that we have
[Music]

02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
people that have to go into their
 
02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
people that have to go into their
district

02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:40.469 align:start position:0%
district
and

02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:40.479 --> 02:41:41.670 align:start position:0%
and
appeal

02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat to both democrats republicans
 
02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:47.110 align:start position:0%
somewhat to both democrats republicans
independents

02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
independents
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
low lower case d
 
02:41:53.359 --> 02:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
low lower case d
democratic

02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:56.630 align:start position:0%
democratic
system

02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it might cut down some of the anger
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we keep seeing in some places i
 
02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
that we keep seeing in some places i
mean

02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's just unspeakable
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
what some
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
people that have been elected are saying
 
02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:13.990 align:start position:0%
people that have been elected are saying
and

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's because they feel
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
that theirs is a safe position and they
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
can say what they want
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
and they can still get elected
 
02:42:23.439 --> 02:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
and they can still get elected
so

02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
i think we need to think carefully about
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
getting something that is seriously not
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering for all the reasons that
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
i've said and for reasons that were said
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
even better by some of the former
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
speakers thank you
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:43.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
i've been handed three blue sheets with
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
names of people who signed up to speak
 
02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i and i've called on everyone who
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak i want to thank
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
everybody sitting here up i'm getting
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
handed another one thank you
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you so much members of
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:15.910 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to give
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is stephen minow i'm a
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
resident of manchester ward 3
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i am representing myself and i am
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%

not affiliated with any other
organization

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not someone who normally speaks out
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
at these meetings or weighs in on
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
political matters
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
i but i felt compelled to come here
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
before this committee as someone who has
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
worked in new hampshire government at
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
both the regional and the county level
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
and because i love this state and the
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
ideas that it purports to stand for
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
my background is in land use planning
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
and economic development i have a
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
master's degree in regional planning
 
02:43:51.279 --> 02:43:52.630 align:start position:0%
master's degree in regional planning
with

02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
a focus on gis systems mapping and
 
02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
a focus on gis systems mapping and
cartography

02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
cartography
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i moved into the state in 2016 to
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
work at the planner for the regional
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
planning commissions
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have lived and worked in both
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
congressional districts and several
 
02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
state house districts and i'm currently
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
a homeowner
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
and i understand both from the
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
governmental and a personal perspective
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
the importance of fair maps that reflect
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
the unique regions of the state and
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
really honor the underlying political
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries like school districts like
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions like sewer
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and water district
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
like public health regions
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and in this proposed map the seacoast is
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily divided
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
lines go which unnecessarily separate
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
counties and as a manchester resident
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
the state house map will reduce our
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
representation even though our
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
population has grown
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
in the 2010 map manchester had 33 seats
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the city population has since grown
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
but under the current republican plan it
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
only gets 32 seats
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
these maps dilute the power of region of
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
regions and force unnecessary changes
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
upon local municipalities who already
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a limited capacity and now we'll
 
02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
have to explain to voters they're in a
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
completely different congressional
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
district that their state
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
representatives have completely changed
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm disappointed in the republican
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
proposed congressional map will impose
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
these burdens
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
and not for reasons of compactness
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
geographic similarities or political his
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
um or historical boundaries
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
but for political considerations
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
um every voice should be heard and every
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
vote should be carried the same way
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
by drawing maps to favor one political
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
party politicians are rigging the
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
process of representation and denying
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
voters their fair share i urge this
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee and the house to reject this
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
republican version of the map thank you
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative you're standing why don't
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
you come on now
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
for the record peter schmidt
 
02:46:12.479 --> 02:46:13.670 align:start position:0%
for the record peter schmidt
representing

02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
district 19 which is stratford
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh dover awards one and two
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
so i'll be brief
 
02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of
 
02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:27.190 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of
extraordinary

02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that the majority
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
has listened carefully
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
because like the great majority perhaps
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
everyone i couldn't quite understand the
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
point of view of the gentleman who spoke
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
a little while ago
 
02:46:44.319 --> 02:46:46.469 align:start position:0%
a little while ago
but

02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
like like the great majority tonight i
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
reject the majorities proposed maps
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
i consider the
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
congressional map to be
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
literally odious
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
and villainous
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
we should not go there
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
state rep maps
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
many of them are
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
defective and deficient
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.359 --> 02:47:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
simply

02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
do not represent good mechanical
 
02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
do not represent good mechanical
treatment

02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
treatment
of

02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
the state and i've been in the house now
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
for 19 years i've seen
 
02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:30.309 align:start position:0%
for 19 years i've seen
the

02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
young lady who ran out here
 
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
out the door from deerfield who gave you
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
a wonderful analysis of the
 
02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
very deleterious effects
 
02:47:41.359 --> 02:47:42.389 align:start position:0%
very deleterious effects
of

02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:47:42.399 --> 02:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
of
the

02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
planned in existing maps
 
02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
planned in existing maps
of

02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
her district in deerfield and the
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
02:47:51.439 --> 02:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
pleased

02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
pleased
 
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard not only eloquence
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
a very thorough analysis of some
 
02:48:00.399 --> 02:48:01.670 align:start position:0%
a very thorough analysis of some
speakers

02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
speakers
please

02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't just make this a party line vote
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
if that's what it's going to be
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
it demonstrates that this is not a good
 
02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
arrangement either at the congressional
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
level or at the state level please we
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
can do better than this
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't give us
 
02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
a partisan vote
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%

appreciate all the time that all the
 
02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee members have put into this i
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
spent some time today reading uh the
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
comments from the various meetings i
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
know so many of you put have put in so
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
much sir thank you could we just have
 
02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
your name for the record my name is
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
corey bellabrow i live here in concord i
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
was admitted to practice law here in
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
1981 and have done so for the most part
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
of these 40 years consistently
 
02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
of these 40 years consistently
and

02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:02.070 --> 02:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
i just have a couple of comments number
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
one this meeting started with the pledge
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
of allegiance which ends with injustice
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
for all
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it is not justice for all
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
to shift
 
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
365 000 people's voting um from one
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
district to another or from each
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
district uh half of those people from
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
one to another
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
for a reason i'm not sure of
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
other than for politics
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
so that's my first comment the second
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
comment i have is that
 
02:49:35.309 --> 02:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
if you try to move
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
365 000 new hampshire citizens
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
for any other reason any other project
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
for a waterway for a highway for a
 
02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
for a waterway for a highway for a
utility

02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
utility
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
i think you'd have a revolution on your
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
hands instead you've gotten very cordial
 
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
citizens making excellent comments
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat repetitive but excellent um
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
very civilly and i think people who are
 
02:49:59.439 --> 02:50:00.469 align:start position:0%
very civilly and i think people who are
not

02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
i've i've been on my feet all my life as
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
a lawyer uh these people have done an
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
excellent job i think that guy in the
 
02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
far right your far right is a ringer he
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
did a really excellent job
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i have to tell you i mean the
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
citizens have appeared in front of you
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
they've given you their frank opinions i
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
read most of the written comments i
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
skimmed a bunch of them and they seem to
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
be unanimously in favor
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
we call that the overwhelming weight of
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
the evidence as justice lynn as i know
 
02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:29.590 align:start position:0%
the evidence as justice lynn as i know
him

02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
would tell you
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
i understand in in a representative
 
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
system you are free to vote as you would
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
but the overwhelming weight of the
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
evidence says you should reject the
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
majority plan
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you should accept the
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
minority plan but it does mean you
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
should not
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
vote for the majority plan
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you

would you like to speak
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%

02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
want to speak specifically to rockingham
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
county and the redistricting map to
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
though all the towns have grown
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
proportionally they have been equal
 
02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:30.710 align:start position:0%
proportionally they have been equal
across

02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
i would ask you keep rockingham county
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
the way it is
 
02:51:37.269 --> 02:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
just as as it has been for the last 10
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
years it is equal across i've been a
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner for six years uh a former
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner for six years in rockingham
 
02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:44.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner for six years in rockingham
county

02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the other issue that happens if you
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
do redistrict the whole county is how do
 
02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
do redistrict the whole county is how do
you

02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
give you up the seat of four year terms
 
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
so if you keep it the same it goes on
 
02:51:59.670 --> 02:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
the same and it's been equal
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
representation on both sides the proud
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%

um mr farnam you were our first speaker
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%

02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
meetings with the first speaker in the
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
