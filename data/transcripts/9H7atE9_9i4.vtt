chair thank you for giving me the time

to present this
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.470 align:start position:0%
this proposal
um

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
again my name is mark allegro i'm a
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative from grafton's seventh
 
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.710 align:start position:0%
representative from grafton's seventh
district

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
is about election integrity
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's a term bandied about a lot these
 
00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 align:start position:0%
days and i know that the first response
 
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people is to roll their
 
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
eyes but
 
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's a serious problem not only here in
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
just by way of a couple of quick
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
examples in arizona the maricopa county
 
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
audit of the 2020 election
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
uncovered scores of thousands of
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
double votes votes by dead people
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
votes by people living in other counties
 
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so on in
 
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.350 align:start position:0%
and so on in
wisconsin

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
wisconsin
 
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
um the court just ruled
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
the use of ballot harvesting boxes
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
as illegal
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
um and we'll see how that plays out in
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
the long run but these things contribute
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
to concerns about
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
whether our votes are being the right
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
way they especially contribute to
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about chain of custody matters
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
so in new hampshire we have our own
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
issues like every state
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
and this bill attempts to mitigate just
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
willful negligence of local elections
 
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
officials i'm not implying that this is
 
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.430 align:start position:0%
officials i'm not implying that this is
a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
rampant issue
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
but it's an issue that exists
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill bent on punishing
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
local election officials
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is just a bill that will provide
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
citizens with recourse
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the face of willful negligence on the
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
occasions when it does arise
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to start with just a couple
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
of examples really just one and then a
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
pushed me
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to actually uh propose this legislation
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
this is and i'm not going to mention
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
names i'm not even going to mention the
 
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
names of towns
 
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.230 align:start position:0%
names of towns
um

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
except in the one case because it's been
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers numerous times so it's
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's no secret and that non-secret is
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bedford
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
election fiasco
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
where it was discovered that close to
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
200 ballots
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
were found missing after the election
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then yet a second batch
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
was found in september from the 2020
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
election was found in september 21
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh during the execution of a special
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
election there
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state if i'm to
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe the um
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to newspapers which is difficult these
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
days uh the secretary of state stated
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
that they've seen this kind of thing
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
before so it's not a one-off
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes mistakes happen
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
but sometimes there's willful negligence
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
associated with those
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
errors shall we say
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of ballots that were
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
missing were kept secret from the public
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
for over a year
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've read this in the
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
newspapers but could you imagine that
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
ballots were misplaced they were
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
discovered in the
 
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.870 align:start position:0%
discovered in the
underneath

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
in one case
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
a box
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
underneath the voting machine
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
and this was kept secret from the public
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
and from town officials
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
for over a year
 
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
for over a year
alright

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
the local elections officials whose
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
names i won't mention
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh at meetings with town officials
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
said we did the right thing by keeping
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
this secret
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
we lost votes
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
we kept it secret now some of them were
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
counted in the second batch i forget
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
whether it was the first or the second
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
batch one of these batches of votes was
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
not even counted
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
not even added in the tally we did the
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
right thing in keeping it secret uh they
 
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
right thing in keeping it secret uh they
stated

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
with what can only be described as
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
serious hutzpah if you'll excuse the
 
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
serious hutzpah if you'll excuse the
expression

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
expression
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
they stated we report i'm paraphrasing
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
here we report to the no this is a quote
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
we report to the secretary of state
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
not the town council
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
i can never imagine
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
a statement like that coming out of my
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
mouth we serve the people
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we report to the people now i've
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
witnessed other infractions in my time
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
being involved in elections some of them
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
some not another some have been as
 
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.469 align:start position:0%
some not another some have been as
simple

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
and difficult to deal with is like in
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
the past year
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
um when poll observers were kept over 40
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
feet from observing ballot tally
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult situation that's easy
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
to understand but there's no excuse for
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
not letting these poll observers
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
do the other things that are in protocol
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
we usually follow such as come in in the
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
morning check the voting machine see
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
that it's zeroed
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
and check it at various times during the
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
day and at the end of the day
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
i've seen poll wardens
 
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
i've seen poll wardens
um

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
um
actually

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh what was the term that was used
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
correcting ballots
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
correcting ballots making sure that the
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
bubbles were filled in all the way
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's not an election official that
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that that's a no-no
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
i'm very sorry
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
poll workers
 
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
poll workers
prompting

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
prompting
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
prompting
voters

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh with their street address
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
everybody knows you you're to come in
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're to tell them your address
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then they say what's your name i've
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
seen people come into polling places
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
not remembering yeah you heard me right
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
not remembering their street address
 
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.589 align:start position:0%
not remembering their street address
okay

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the poll worker prompting them
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
prompting them this is a no-no
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
i i've witnessed a bunch of other
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
infractions but there was one in
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
particular that was relatively recent
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
that inspired me to draft this
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh with my co-sponsor
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that was in an election that took
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
place it was a special election in 2021
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
um again i'm not going to mention the
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
town or the candidates i
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
um i went there just as a volunteer to
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
hold signs
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
and uh out came a voter
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
and you probably haven't heard about
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
it was actually i think obscene
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
i heard a voter
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
come out and say i just filled out my
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
ballot i went to fill out my ballot
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that the bubble for the
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
to make a long story short uh someone
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
who had standing to actually inquire
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
went in and inquired of this election
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
official how did this happen was this
 
00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
official how did this happen was this
one

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
or was this many who knows you know if
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
this happens 10 times that's 10
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
disallowed votes when the ballots are
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
counted and in these town elections 10
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
and this was the explanation uh from the
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
election official
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna paraphrase this person he said
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
well we were running out of ballots and
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i ran over to the other polling site
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
and i grabbed a handful of ballots
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
and i came back with them and apparently
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
this spoiled ballot was amongst them
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
so it's my fault
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
well i got home and i discussed this
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
with an acquaintance who served as a
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
pole warden
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
and when she heard it and i knew this
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
was wrong
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
but she knew the details and was
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
incensed what are the problems with this
 
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
incensed what are the problems with this
explanation

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
a paul warden or king george himself
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
cannot just go to another polling site
 
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.389 align:start position:0%
cannot just go to another polling site
and

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
quote unquote grab a handful of ballots
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is a no-no okay
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
anybody who works in the polls
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
certainly with any regularity
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
understands that ballots come
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
in sealed packages
 
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.050 align:start position:0%
and if you have to
 
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
and if you have to
[Music]

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
transport ballots
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's a reporting process and you
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't just grab a handful of ballots off
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
the desk
 
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
the desk
so

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's question number one how
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
did this election official
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the second question is how did a spoil
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
ballot wind up in a stack of
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
presumably unspoiled ballots
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
because spoil ballots are supposed to be
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
marked clearly and put in a separate
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
envelope and kept clear of those other
 
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.829 align:start position:0%
envelope and kept clear of those other
ballots

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
so there were at least two matters here
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that amounted not to just a goof up but
 
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
that amounted not to just a goof up but
perhaps

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
unacceptable negligence
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
the problem is that voters have almost
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
zero recourse
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
to deal with these matters
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay election officials make mistakes
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
like everybody else but they also do
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
things out of laziness and out of
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
willful negligence
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know the rules
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
appear to serve them when they need to
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
give people instructions about stepping
 
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
give people instructions about stepping
back

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know you can't wear that in the
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
polling site and so on and so forth but
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to actually following
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
clear-cut rules like chain of custody
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
and access to ballot for poll observers
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
and matters like that
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the rules are just
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the rules are just
ignored

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the voting public has no recourse and
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill seeks to provide
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
there are no punitive measures
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
but this allows
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
poll observers when voting officials
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
break protocol
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
and it leads to significant errors
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
it allows recourse for voters to take
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
the matter to court to file
 
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.430 align:start position:0%
the matter to court to file
and

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.230 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
if found negligent that
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
local official can be removed from
 
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
local official can be removed from
office

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
yes i know
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
this might create a hardship because
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
these are not exactly the most popular
 
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
these are not exactly the most popular
positions

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know this isn't like movie star
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to be one
 
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.269 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to be one
but

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
again we have to put the horse before
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
the card
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
we have a serious concern about voting
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
integrity in this state and around the
 
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.550 align:start position:0%
integrity in this state and around the
country

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
and when
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
errors like this are being tolerated
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
with no recourse
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
it does not contribute to our confidence
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the outcome of elections presently
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
voters feel
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
hurted disrespected
 
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.670 align:start position:0%
hurted disrespected
ignored

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
no wonder there's so little confidence
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
in our electoral system and this isn't
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room also understands
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a partisan issue this has been
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house of
 
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house of
representatives

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
representatives
we

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
this institution of which i'm a part
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
we have it in our power to help rectify
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
the situation not only do we have it in
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
our power but by constitution we have
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the duty to rectify this kind of
 
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
the duty to rectify this kind of
situation

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
we have the ability
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
to restore confidence
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
i scratch my head and i wonder how could
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
we not take an opportunity to mitigate
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
these problems as they arise and try to
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
come to solutions
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
that help restore this confidence that's
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'll take that opportunity to end any
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
prepared statement i have to make and
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
i would just urge you to please
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't be polite when questioning me i my
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
whole career has been answering
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
questions at the lab bench and in the
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
classroom i enjoy questions and i look
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
questions

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
did you report any of these infractions
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state that you had
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
witnessed well some of them have been
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
reported in the one case i mentioned
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
about filling in bubbles
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
completely that was reported to the town
 
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.389 align:start position:0%
completely that was reported to the town
clerk

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
clerk
um

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
i know that this one in bedford was
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
reported to the secretary of state and
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes um again i'm not going to mention
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
town but some of these
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
breaks in protocol i'll call them were
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
reported to the secretary of state's
 
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.230 align:start position:0%
reported to the secretary of state's
office

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
but you know how it is on election day
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state must get
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
goodness knows how many phone calls
 
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
goodness knows how many phone calls
and

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
in my experience anyway they rarely get
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
back to the person who's phoned in with
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint so yes
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
the ones i've spoken about here today
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
they've all been reported to
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know the next the next highest
 
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
you know the next the next highest
authority

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
but there was
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
never any action taken on any of them
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
although the bedford
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
situation i understand is being
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
investigated by the attorney general but
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that turns out okay thank
 
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that turns out okay thank
you

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative hamer allset
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
last sentence of of your added wording
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
lines 12 and 13 you say
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
in any such court proceeding if the
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
court finds that removal is warranted
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
the prevailing registered voter shall be
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
entitled to an award of reasonable
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and court costs um
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
it does not indicate who would
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
compensate the person for those
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
court costs or fees are you anticipating
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
that it would be the
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
the defendant or that the town or the
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
state or
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
who would compensate for those attorneys
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
fees and court costs yeah thank you for
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
pointing that out i noticed that myself
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
this was primarily drafted by
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative silber who's an attorney
 
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.430 align:start position:0%
representative silber who's an attorney
and

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with you i think that's an
 
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
i agree with you i think that's an
oversight

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i can have that attended to
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
fairly rapidly
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so that that proper wording is in
 
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
and so that that proper wording is in
here

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
my expectation is that those court costs
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh covered by
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
the the defendant in this case
 
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
the the defendant in this case
but

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't know fully how the judicial
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
system works
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
it it needs to be compensated by someone
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you're asking
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know mr smith and
 
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.390 align:start position:0%
you know mr smith and
thornton

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
thornton
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
to cover perhaps thousands of dollars
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
legal costs and that would be a um
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
a real
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
impediment to
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
to them actually
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
reporting and following through on these
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of infractions
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll see to that
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i will get back to you
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh within 48 hours
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up madam chair
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.590 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
in that same vein
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
i think we recognize that there is
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
potential for
 
00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:50.710 align:start position:0%
potential for
um

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
politicizing this
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody is just upset and doesn't
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
like the way things are sure
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
they can make things miserable for
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
election officials
um

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a suit and the suit fails
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
should there be compensation for the
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
court costs of the election worker in
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
the same way well if
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
a case has no merit of course the court
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
can dismiss it uh immediately
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that solves part of your problem
 
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.990 align:start position:0%
and that solves part of your problem
um

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
no there is not a mechanism
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
um and that's true in i would think the
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
vast majority of
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
of civil suits
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to hear a suggestion
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
but again if you have people that
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
see something that they think is wrong
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's a deterrent
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
for them to report it
 
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.990 align:start position:0%
for them to report it
um

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
we can i'll i'll be sure to address that
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
with my co-sponsor on this um
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
and get back to you within 48 hours okay
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%

being with us today
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chairman and uh
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you rep uh allegro
 
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
thank you rep uh allegro
uh

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.590 align:start position:0%
uh
there's

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
from what i understand there is a chain
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
of command on
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
the election site
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
being the
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
moderator and
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
the the town clerk
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
and then of course the secretary of
 
00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.710 align:start position:0%
and then of course the secretary of
state

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.789 align:start position:0%
have a
law

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
writing in
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
avenues for litigation
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more prudent to
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
write a law requiring some kind of
 
00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
write a law requiring some kind of
chain

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
chain
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
of command
 
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
of command
and

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
chain of
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
information being passed
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
as far as any kind of those infractions
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
um if i'm not understanding your
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
question let me know but if i it seems
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
to me that you want to incorporate into
 
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.149 align:start position:0%
to me that you want to incorporate into
this

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
a prepared chain of command
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the purpose being that the um
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
whoever is responsible for committing
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the infraction should be the one
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
identified to that i would have to
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
answer that um infractions can be
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
committed at all levels and ultimately
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes um the person at the top of that
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
chain of command is responsible but
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
again this isn't a matter of um
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
punishing people for innocent
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh errors so if if a purposeful
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
infraction is committed by
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't say a town clerk and the town
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
moderator doesn't know about it uh until
 
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.710 align:start position:0%
moderator doesn't know about it uh until
later

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.630 align:start position:0%
later
um

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the chain of command i think is you know
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's not the
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
town moderator that would be the subject
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
of possible removal it would be the town
 
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.430 align:start position:0%
of possible removal it would be the town
clerk

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever the the lower on the chain
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
of command is then did i answer your
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
question or
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
sort of gonna have a follow-up so
 
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.950 align:start position:0%
sort of gonna have a follow-up so
um

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
so if this litigation this uh
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
basically litigation bill
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
is not meant to
 
00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:28.830 align:start position:0%
is not meant to
be

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
punitive um
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
having some sort of
 
00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
having some sort of
written

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:39.029 align:start position:0%
written
uh

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
receipt of an infraction
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
being passed up that chain of command
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can be
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
looked at by
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
the moderator by the the town clerk
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
and if needed the
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just saying hey this guy
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
did something
 
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
did something
and

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know it's not
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not really you know like i'll take
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
care of it
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh might not work for for reasons you
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
can see yourself yes now i think i
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
understand your question
 
00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
understand your question
um

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
so your question is is can we not deal
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
by allowing uh superiors in the chain of
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
command to deal with the infraction
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
before it gets to a court and
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
i have to agree that's another good uh
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
idea that we can incorporate into this
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill by an amendment um
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
i think it's very rational idea uh and
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
potentially save costs
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
and saves the unfortunate reality that
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know potentially create
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
more cases for our judicial system to
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
handle thank you
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
i have a couple
 
00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
i have a couple
um

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative um just on the bill
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
mechanics is the intent
 
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.549 align:start position:0%
mechanics is the intent
that

00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
the registered voter may be bring suit
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
an official in their community or any
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
community because i'm not sure i see
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
that restriction
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
well i think it
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
so in other words i am a registered
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
voter in
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
goffstown could i bring suit if this
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill was to become law could i bring
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
suit in
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh bedford for the
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
what you've just talked about today
 
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
what you've just talked about today
because

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
it talks about it says to remove any and
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
then the list
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
or other town or city official but it
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't say of the registered voters
 
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't say of the registered voters
community

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
the intent is not for anybody in the
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
state to bring
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh the matter to the courts
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
for any other jurisdiction the intent is
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the matter to be brought
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
from within the jurisdiction
 
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
from within the jurisdiction
okay

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
and further question is do you have any
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
idea what the average length of time to
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
resolve an equity matter in the superior
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
court is
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh no i i don't um and i appreciate that
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
might be a better question for
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative silber yeah
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
every bill has uh improvements that can
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
be made but
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is a case where i think we have
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
more than the starting material
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh required to mitigate an otherwise
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
unaddressable issue
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean you see all these these people
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
committing infractions of standard
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
protocol and in some cases law
 
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.789 align:start position:0%
protocol and in some cases law
and

00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're there for the next election so
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
if it takes time to go through court
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's a weakness of our court
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
system of our judicial system
 
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
system of our judicial system
but

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
these people could remain in office
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
committing the same
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
pardon the term screw-ups
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
at infinitum
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
the way things stand
 
00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
the way things stand
so

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's a
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
vast improvement to have a mechanism for
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
the public to have some recourse
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
um finally my last question at this time
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i just note that we have a bill for
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a similar purpose coming up
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
after this so i'm not as concerned about
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
the start time
 
00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.070 align:start position:0%
the start time
um

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
you the bill refers to
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
a knowing
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
refers to someone knowingly failing to
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
perform a duty
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
you talked about willful negligence and
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
at another time said unacceptable
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
negligence what is
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
the standard that
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
you all were trying to set when this
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill was drafted
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
knowing infraction
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so intentional is that what you mean
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
intentional

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
is with forethought
 
00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
is with forethought
okay

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
not intentional
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
but then the failure to correct that
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
mistake or perhaps even compound it
 
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.510 align:start position:0%
mistake or perhaps even compound it
um

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that's willful
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
um we're parsing words now on this uh
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
an election official knows
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
an election official knows that they're
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
not supposed to go to another polling
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
site and grab a fist full of of ballots
 
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.950 align:start position:0%
site and grab a fist full of of ballots
okay

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know of course the
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
the finding has to be in favor of the
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
plaintiff so
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility here lies with the
 
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
the responsibility here lies with the
plaintiff

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
plaintiff
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
here's an example where a um
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
an election official
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
understands knows has been practicing is
 
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
understands knows has been practicing is
trained

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not allowed to just go to
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
another polling site and grab a fistful
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
of bills i mean a fistful of ballots
 
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.389 align:start position:0%
of bills i mean a fistful of ballots
um

00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
and so that is
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's a negligence
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
you do know representative that you can
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
transfer ballots under certain
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
procedures from polling places yes
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
yes that's right and had that election
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
official follow those procedures it
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been an issue and had that
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
election official follow those
 
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
election official follow those
procedures

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't have somehow managed to
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
scoop up
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
one or more spoiled ballots we'll never
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
know how many
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
that voters want to have recourse
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%

responsible for anyone that i hire
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written it's going
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be next to impossible to hire people
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
i've already had assistant moderators
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
reach out to me
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
and tell me if this is how it's going to
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
be i'm not gonna work anymore
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
because we have voters come in and ask
 
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.029 align:start position:0%
because we have voters come in and ask
questions

00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is because of what they
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
hear in the news
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
and they wonder
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
is the machine plugged into the internet
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
um is there a watermark on the ballot is
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%

you know all these questions about
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
things happen in other states and we
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
don't do things the same way in new

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
explain this is the law this is how it
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
works this is what we do
 
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.830 align:start position:0%
works this is what we do
they

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
what happened in bedford
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know we all heard about it on the
 
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
you know we all heard about it on the
news

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
news
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
i honestly
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
i don't understand and if something like
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
that had happened in derry i would
 
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.870 align:start position:0%
that had happened in derry i would
resign

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
resign
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
that it's just me because that is you
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
know counting the ballots making sure
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
they're all accounted for that's the job
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the moderator
 
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
of the moderator
um

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
that but that's me i know not everyone's
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.350 align:start position:0%
the same
but

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know the moderator runs the polling
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
place we have a two-year term
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
we can be replaced in two years
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
um i know there's another bill coming up
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
about recall and about three-year terms
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
well maybe it needs to be expanded and
 
00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.710 align:start position:0%
well maybe it needs to be expanded and
allow

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
all election officials to be recalled if
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers people who didn't put their
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
names on ballots suddenly being taken to
 
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.870 align:start position:0%
names on ballots suddenly being taken to
court

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.549 align:start position:0%
court
um

00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
maybe having to pay fees
 
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.190 align:start position:0%
maybe having to pay fees
um

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
and you know you have the voter being
 
00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.870 align:start position:0%
and you know you have the voter being
reimbursed

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
if

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%

um you know they work for you know six
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
hours seven hours
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
they could go to court and even if they
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
win they could be out thousands of
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
dollars it there's no there's no reason
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering would you
 
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.350 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering would you
uh

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
favor this bill if it only
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
included people that were elected
 
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
included people that were elected
and

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit further than that is what
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
about people that have been trained what
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
if it was people that were elected and
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
people who had gone through training
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
um again
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
i i have issues with anyone who's not
 
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
i i have issues with anyone who's not
elected

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
being subject to this
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
um because i think you know you know
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
when you put your name on the ballot
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
you're putting yourself out there
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're you're holding yourself up to a
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
higher standard
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think when people are trained and they
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
we had an incident in derry in 2020
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
where a
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically electioneering it was caught
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
on video
 
00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
on video
um

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.789 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh that video was sent to the secretary
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
of state's office in the attorney
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that was prior to
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
my becoming town moderator
 
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.909 align:start position:0%
my becoming town moderator
and

00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:32.149 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office took it
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
from there and i know at the end they
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
chose not to prosecute
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
that poll worker did reach out to me
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
when i got elected and said they'd be
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
willing to work and i was not interested
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
in hiring them
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative teresa
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam jim thank you man for
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
so whether
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
a poll worker is elected or a volunteer
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.310 align:start position:0%
or not
um

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
if they commit a wrongful action in
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
regard to voting
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
uh procedures
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
should they not be held to the same
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.669 align:start position:0%
should they not be held to the same
standard

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
see it's my job to know every rsa in and
 
00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.669 align:start position:0%
see it's my job to know every rsa in and
out

00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know someone who is hired and
 
00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
you know someone who is hired and
trained

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
to do a particular job
 
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
to do a particular job
even

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
you know even if they are an assistant
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
moderator they
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
they don't know all the little ins and
 
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.069 align:start position:0%
they don't know all the little ins and
outs

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
outs
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
and an innocent mistake could be made
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
but as a as the overarching moderator
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's my job to have my eyes everywhere
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
and watch that and correct anything that
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
right i understand that but some of the
 
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
right i understand that but some of the
um

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
the actions we heard uh referenced
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
from the last witness um were things
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
whether you know the rsas or not seem to
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
be common sense shouldn't have happened
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
do you think that um
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
in a case where it's a again a knowing
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
situation there should be some way to to
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
solve that
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't happen again well you know
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
we've had multiple polling places in the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
past in derry if if there was a need to
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
transfer ballots between one polling
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
place and the other
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know there's a procedure there for
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
the town clerk and another election
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
official to do that
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't just be
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
i i mean
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
i don't even use the term pull warden it
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be someone going over and
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
doing that like you have you do have to
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
to go do that like it just makes no
 
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
to go do that like it just makes no
sense

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%

gray's niche like nature okay great
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you a bit unusual um
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm from nhma
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
we do object to this bill uh one of the
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
things we'd like to point out is there's
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
already a mechanism to remove
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
any town official who doesn't perform
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
their duties
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's because town officials must take
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
the oath of office
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
pursuant to uh rsa 42 colon one and that
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
oath of office is the oath of office in
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution part two article 84
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
which states the official
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
will faithfully and impartially
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
discharge and perform all duties and
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
comment on them
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
and if they don't they are subject to
 
00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.270 align:start position:0%
and if they don't they are subject to
removal

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
removal
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
so there's no need to
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
add additional people who can come in
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
here and remove any town official
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
i guess there are a couple other items
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
that came up during the discussion uh
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
today that i'd like to address
 
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
today that i'd like to address
um

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
the first is that uh
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't have any
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
sort of penalty for a vexatious or
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuit so
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
if i don't like the result that comes
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
out of my polling place
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
or well as written it doesn't specify
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
polling place but i assume an amendment
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
would do that i could just go file suit
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
and allege that something has occurred
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
it there's no penalty for me doing that
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
at some point it could get thrown out
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
but it's going to cost
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
both the in potentially the individual
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
town official and almost certainly the
 
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
town official and almost certainly the
town

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
money to
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
fight that even if it's just to the
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
a dismissal um to the point of you know
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
the court looking at it
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
seeing what the filings are and saying
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
well there's no allegation here there's
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
no penalty for me doing that i could
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
just go and do that because i don't like
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
the result
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and i could just allege that the
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
moderator or the clerk or whoever didn't
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
do their job
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a big problem
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
that we foresee because of course
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
you could politicize this and that could
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
be a result that occurs
 
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.310 align:start position:0%
be a result that occurs
um

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i wanted to uh
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
point out is that
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
under the statute being modified rsa uh
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
666 colon 3
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
provision is actually a a misdemeanor
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where the the intent is
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
any public officer whose duty relates to
 
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
any public officer whose duty relates to
elections

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
she'll knowingly fail to perform the
 
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.349 align:start position:0%
she'll knowingly fail to perform the
duty

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
duty
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
is guilty of a misdemeanor and the
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
second section which is the new section
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
being added in
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a criminal penalty um and
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
presumably it wouldn't because any
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
registered voter can file the suit and
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's actually no
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
intent there it's just
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
any registered voter can bring the suit
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
against any of these election officials
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
for failure to perform their election
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
duties so there's no
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
willfulness there's no knowingly there's
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
no negligently there's nothing it's just
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
hey that i think this person failed to
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
perform their duties i'm suing
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
um so those are really the points i want
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
to make i'm happy to take questions
 
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.550 align:start position:0%
to make i'm happy to take questions
questions

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative terozian
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you uh for
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
looking at part one in here maybe i'm
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
missing something you said it says any
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
public officer upon
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh duty relating to elections is imposed
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
who shall knowingly fail to perform such
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
duty or who shall knowingly perform in
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
such a way and so forth so the word
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
knowingly is in there i thought i heard
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
you say
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
just for clarification um i'll deal with
 
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.670 align:start position:0%
just for clarification um i'll deal with
this

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.710 align:start position:0%
this
one

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
refers to a misdemeanor in the last line
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
which means it's a criminal action those
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
are not brought by individuals those are
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
brought they can be brought by
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
individuals but they are more commonly
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
brought by the state
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
two has to do with the actual individual
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
bringing suit
 
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
bringing suit
and

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
act

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
intent or
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
qualification of knowingly does not
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
transfer to the second paragraph
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
when i think i can do so ably i like to
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
take witnesses off the hot seat
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we we heard
 
00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
so we we heard
of

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
infractions of
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
of elections election rules
 
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.670 align:start position:0%
of elections election rules
and

00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know it was acknowledged that those
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
are not common
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
correct but
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
if even if they're uncommon or even if
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
they go beyond uncommon to rare
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
it can change the outcome of elections
 
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.829 align:start position:0%
it can change the outcome of elections
so

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh a recommendation as to how to deal
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
with these
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
issues in a timely way
 
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.069 align:start position:0%
issues in a timely way
without

00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
without
this

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
process well based on what the sponsor
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
said and i'm not an elected official so
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
i i don't have this uh personal
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge but based on what the sponsor
 
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
knowledge but based on what the sponsor
said

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the secretary of state's
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
office may not have enough staff on
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
election day in order to address
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
concerns coming to them
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
it certainly seems appropriate that the
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office as the
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
overseer of the state's elections would
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
be the one to
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
deal with problems
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
um and they might need more staffing but
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's not something i would argue for
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
as an hma but certainly that seems to be
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
the linchpin here is if people are
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
making complaints and they're not
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
getting responses
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps it's the case that uh
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
we need more people so that they can
 
00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
we need more people so that they can
respond

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
further questions for the witness
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
coming that is the last speaker i have
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill there was a
 
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.430 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill there was a

remote
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
testimony to the extent of opposing or
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%

and

00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
two persons have signed up one in favor
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'm closing the public hearing on

next we will move on to our second
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
hearing of the day which is hb 1485.
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
this is relative to direct recall
 
00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:24.829 align:start position:0%
this is relative to direct recall
elections

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
on and i'm going to look to the last man
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
standing as to sponsors in this
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee that is here today to
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney again uh better
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
looking and smarter get that joke out of
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
the way
um

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh representative sweeney is the
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this bill i am a
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on it um it is a bill um
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
do dealing with recall elections for
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
municipal offices with terms of three
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
years i believe they're going to look at
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
expanding that to three years or more
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the the overarching idea
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.190 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the the overarching idea
is

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we turn over virtually
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
or i shouldn't say virtually but the
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vast majority of offices
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
including being one of two states that
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
does it for governor
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
in our opinion meeting the other
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors that gives voters a good opport
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
a good bite at the apple every time they
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
elect somebody that maybe doesn't serve
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
their best interests um and everyone in
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
this room is a part of that and some of
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
us have been on both sides of that will
 
00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:37.349 align:start position:0%
us have been on both sides of that will
so

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
what i what we did try to do when
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
crafting it was set the bar high enough
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
to where the recall wouldn't be
 
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.950 align:start position:0%
to where the recall wouldn't be
frivolous

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
but it would be attainable so the way it
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
would work is there would be a petition
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
just very similar to a warrant article
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
except you would need 10
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
of the total registered voters in the
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
last general election
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
um jurisdiction to sign the
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
the petition um at that point the
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
petition would go to the town clerk's
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
office where it could be certified if
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
the town clerk's office refuses to
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
certify it for
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we do offer redress
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
through the court system an expedited
 
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
through the court system an expedited
redress

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
redress
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
obviously there's some conflict of
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
interest if you're the town clerk and
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
judging the petitions on your recall
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're legitimate or not
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
so we had to provide an escape valve
 
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
so we had to provide an escape valve
there

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.829 align:start position:0%
there
um

00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
there can be a recall election i believe
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney is going to
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
address uh he's gonna address my
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
concerns with that which is i want that
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
recall election on an already occurring
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
election i know it's currently not
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
written like that
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
the election to replace
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
the uh if if the recall election takes
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
place there's another bar that has to be
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.630 align:start position:0%
place there's another bar that has to be
hit

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
hit
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
so it has to have it has to have an
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
election with at least 20 registered
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
voter turnout so that way 10 people
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
can't show up and punt somebody out of
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
office um and obviously there has to be
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
a majority of those voting
 
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.069 align:start position:0%
a majority of those voting
um

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
the election to um
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
the the election to replace someone um
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
if there is one we'll be at the next
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
regularly called election we don't want
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be shoving a bunch of elections down
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
on town clerks
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
um there is a provision in here
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
to this is something that i caught
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
did see this representative sweeney and
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
i fixed it for you
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
i fixed what i referred to as the escape
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
hatch which is somebody's about to be
 
00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
hatch which is somebody's about to be
recalled

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
recalled
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
they resign real fast and then many of
 
00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.270 align:start position:0%
they resign real fast and then many of
these

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
many of these offices are when there's a
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
vacancy they are filled by an existing
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
board so there was an escape patch where
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
you could resign
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
the board could reappoint you and your
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
recall would be basically circumvented
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
so what this does do is it says if you
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
are subject to a recall and you resign
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
you may not be placed back in that
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
office but you may run for that office
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
again in the regular in the next regular
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
election for that office so it doesn't
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
preclude you from running in the future
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
it does um preclude you from using that
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
as an escape hatch
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
um and with that i will try to answer
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
these questions the best i can like i
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
said this was not um
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
i am a sponsor of this bill i am
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea but i was not the
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
primary driver of it
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative tarosian thank
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
perry for taking the question
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you say but i wasn't
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
sure that that you were going to correct
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
in other words this is for a three-year
 
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
in other words this is for a three-year
term

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
so you're going to correct that so it
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
would include three three or more yes um
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
because there are terms in from this
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
pool office like i know in litchfield
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist serves a
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
six-year term um
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
so we will we will expand it out to
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
three-year terms
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's up to the committee if they want to
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the previous bill if they want to
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
bring it down to the two-year terms
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
our intention was the three-year terms
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
because we we do believe that
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
two-year cycles of cleaning out
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
politicians is gives the voters ample
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
let's call it mistakes
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
um but three years and more you you know
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
if you elect somebody and they run on
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
campaign promise a and then they get in
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
and immediately stop do the opposite of
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
a you have to live under that for three
 
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.190 align:start position:0%
a you have to live under that for three
years

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't think that that's right
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
further questions representative growing
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry for
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question and uh certainly not
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
from somebody that's uh smarter or
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
better looking
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
smarter maybe maybe older and wiser
 
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:39.430 align:start position:0%
smarter maybe maybe older and wiser
um

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh
 
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh
the

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
you you just mentioned three or more
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
years but the bill specifically says
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
three years is that something you plan
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
to imagine correct i was when i was
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
reading it this morning going oh my god
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
joe what'd you get me into i went oh he
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
missed that
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so yeah that has that's supposed to
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
be three or more i do know that for a
 
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.309 align:start position:0%
be three or more i do know that for a
fact

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions for
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.390 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
you

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
i i know you may not be able to answer
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
this because you say you're not the
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
driver of this but the
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
better looking mr
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
was there any incident
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
that you can recall that was
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
the motivation for drafting this um so i
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
could speak personally to that um so as
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know i represent the town of
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
litchfield as well
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
and in litchfield we have it's it's very
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
standard right school where members
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
usually serve for three years um
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
we had a school board that signed that
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
released this document to parents at the
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
beginning of remote learning
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
it was a dei document
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
and in the dei document was a list of
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
links to things that my voters found
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
objectionable they did the classic pack
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
meeting there were things in that
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
document about defunding the police
 
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
document about defunding the police
and

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
the school board i went to that board
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
meeting i didn't take a massive position
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
on it i'm not a resident of the town you
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
know if i had children they wouldn't go
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
to that school system but i do represent
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
that town and what i told the school
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
board at the time was you guys they were
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
trying to shortchange the meeting they
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
were trying to limit public comment cut
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
it down to 10 minutes in total not 10
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
minutes per person 10 minutes in total
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i told them you guys need to listen
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
you need to basically take your lumps on
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
this one you messed up
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
they were indignant
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to describe that
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that they were
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
malicious in this
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i said it at the time i didn't think
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
they were malicious i didn't think it
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
was intentional but they tried to cover
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
it up and shift blame
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
um all of them did and to have somebody
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
who was in my opinion um attempting to
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
cover things up they were holding
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
executive session meetings for things
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
that were not personnel matters
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
specifically about this issue so they
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
were trying to hide from the public
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
and that's not acceptable to me and it's
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
not acceptable to
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
the voters that i represent in
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
litchfield they have to wait for three
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
years while this person's persons while
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
they cycle out these persons or have the
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to cycle out these persons
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
um so that was the impetus when they
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
propose it to me i said yeah we need to
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
be able to clean these out a little more
 
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
be able to clean these out a little more
regularly

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
and once again i don't think it was
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
malicious with what they did the
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
document was appalling um but i i get
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
that when things are moving quick and
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
covet was crazy times but it's um you
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
know the cover-ups worse than the crime
 
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.270 align:start position:0%
know the cover-ups worse than the crime
so

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
further question representative
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
prudhomme o'brien
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
what is a dei document uh diversity
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
equity inclusion it was a document they
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored after george floyd like i said
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
there were things in the document that
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
weren't objectible but they provided a
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
list of links for parents
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
and the one that really got me going was
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
they had a link to a document that
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
supported defunding the police
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
as a political position
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
and once again i'm not trying to draw
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
condemnation on the document itself the
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
document they they admitted that the
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
document was inappropriate after it was
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
after we packed a school board meeting
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
but their behavior
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
leading up to it the executive session
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't have been an executive
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
session because as most of you were
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
some form of executive town government
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know that executive session is used
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively for personnel matters
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
school boards will use it for matters
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a particular student
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
but this was a matter of effectively
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum it was being distributed to
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
parents as a resource document it had no
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
business and executive session and they
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
they tried to cover it up and and and i
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
get it i wouldn't have wanted to be on
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
camera for that either if that's what i
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
was doing
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that's what they did
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
they got caught and they were pretty
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
unremorseful about it
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
you talk about the school board
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
and they are three year terms
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
but they're not all at the same time
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
correct so there is a um
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in here i believe
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
at least i told joe it needed to be in
 
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
at least i told joe it needed to be in
there

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
that basically limits when the
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
recall can happen
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it can't happen immediately after an
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
election or within a certain time period
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
beforehand if it's not in there it
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
should have been because i told him it
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be in there
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
um because basically when they when they
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
came to me with this idea i said you
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
know i like the idea but i don't want to
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
be abused um
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
so it should be in there if it's not but
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
if it's not it definitely i will i will
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
tell you i'll be putting it in there
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
because i do not want at the bottom of
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
page two at the bottom of page two and
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought
 
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.829 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought
um

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
it should be it should be a certain time
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
limit in here
 
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.790 align:start position:0%
limit in here
um

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
actually staying corrected page one page
 
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
actually staying corrected page one page
one

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh here we go yep no application for
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
recall petition shall be filed during
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
the first 180 days or during the last
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
180 days of any official term so that
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
was a that was a provision that i
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
demanded that be in there because it's
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous if somebody gets elected
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
and you don't like them and you
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
immediately file a recall petition on
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
them it's also ridiculous to hold a
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
recall petition for someone you're going
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
to be voting on within 180 days so
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
trying to find an actual balanced
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
approach to this because i don't want it
 
00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:19.829 align:start position:0%
approach to this because i don't want it
to

00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
be abused or get off the rails
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
further question
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually i never got to my question
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that welcome to election
 
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that welcome to election
law

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
essentially because you have the 180
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
days before 180 days after
 
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.069 align:start position:0%
days before 180 days after
essentially

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
on a school board
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
you would only
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
do a recall on the majority of the
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
school board correct maybe one depending
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the school board
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
maybe two
 
00:54:57.599 --> 00:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
maybe two
which

00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
means that
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
even if you were successful in your
 
00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:03.510 align:start position:0%
even if you were successful in your
recall

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have them the same
 
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.349 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have them the same
majority

00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
what you think about this
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff the expense to the
 
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff the expense to the
town

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
for a situation where it's not going to
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
change the outcome of what's going on in
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
so to that effect as i said in the
 
00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:25.270 align:start position:0%
so to that effect as i said in the
beginning

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that all the
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors agree upon is that two years
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
is is a good amount of time
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
to change people out
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
and this operates within that window um
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
to answer your question about the i mean
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
i guess to your point is you're asking
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
about the burden on the town um
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we did try to pair up the
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
elections with the existing elections um
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
i've said before in this committee that
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want an election
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
just here and there because the wins
 
00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:54.789 align:start position:0%
just here and there because the wins
changed

00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
which is why we put in these
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
pretty large bumpers if you will
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
to stop that from occurring but it is a
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
very you know it's a very valid point
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
that you make you know there will be an
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
election there will be a recall um there
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
will be a cost to that um but ultimately
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's um that's that is one of
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
the functions of government so i am
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
extremely judicious about when we create
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
new elections if you will um and i am
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
extremely judicious with the taxpayers
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars i understand town resources
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
dollars are precious i understand they
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
come from property taxes
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
i am extremely sensitive to all those
 
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
i am extremely sensitive to all those
issues

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
and like with all things in government
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative berry i just want
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
clarification based on the the last
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
discussion here that this recall
 
00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:48.710 align:start position:0%
discussion here that this recall
is

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
strictly individual it's not recalling a
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
board is that correct correct it
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
actually specifically says that in the
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
um language that a recall provision can
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
only be used for one
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
for one but the petition can only be
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
used for one individual i guess there
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
could be a situation where
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
people signed up for as many as they as
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
they could but once again the 180-day
 
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.230 align:start position:0%
they could but once again the 180-day
provision

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
the length of the office of terms it's
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's an intentionally narrow scoped
 
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.549 align:start position:0%
it's it's an intentionally narrow scoped
um

00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
legislation to put and it's not just
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
about school board members there's
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
selectmen in um zoning boards and all
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that can have two three
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh three four-year terms um
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
and it just you know i think part of it
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
is is if you're in a like i said the the
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
town of litchfield posted there hey this
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
is what's going to be on the municipal
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
ballot in march uh they actually did
 
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.789 align:start position:0%
ballot in march uh they actually did
yesterday

00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the supervisor checklist is going to
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
run for a six year term um and if you're
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
sitting there for six you know you get
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
in there and you're in year and year one
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
and you're like well you know i can i
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
can do or not do this job well and i'll
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
have four years to correct it um well
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not um so the idea is we know we
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
should always be accountable to the
 
00:57:56.799 --> 00:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
should always be accountable to the
voters

00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
we should always be attuned to them some
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
of us are better at it than others some
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
of us think we're better at it than we
 
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.549 align:start position:0%
of us think we're better at it than we
are

00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
are
but

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire system of
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
government 400 state representatives
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
cycling every two years the government
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
cycles every two years our our citizen
 
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
cycles every two years our our citizen
legislator

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
is designed to be accountable to the
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
voters at all times and by having these
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
these um positions that are longer than
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
two years we kind of they kind of get
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
removed from that accountability
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
people's memories are are short uh and
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's some good things and there's bad
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
things obviously the united states
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
senate six year term for a reason
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be the the gentle
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
person's body and and we're supposed to
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
work together um you know there's good
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
and bad things about not being able to
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
change people out but um it is my
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and the way new hampshire system
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
of government is set up is you get a
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
bite at that apple pretty often unless
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
you have a three four five six year term
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then you don't further questions
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you
 
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.710 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you
representative

00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
a three year term you have a 180 day
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
window 180 day window so it basically
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
leaves you with a two-year term right
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
um well to do the conductive recall no
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's not two years it's because it's
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's before or after but
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's designed for people who for the
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
three year term specifically it's
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
designed for people who get in office
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
and immediately
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
cease to perform or perform counter to
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
what they promised um for those remember
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's three there are longer terms
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
in three years right but to your point
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
yes you're making the point that's a
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
very narrow window i assume
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
and we're talk anyway i just
 
00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:39.589 align:start position:0%
and we're talk anyway i just
i'm

00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:40.710 align:start position:0%
i'm
just

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's real that's all i'm done
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah it's a very valid point
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's i'm not gonna refute that
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
point it's it's the the
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
the reason this thing is is so scoped is
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
bluntly because of me because i said if
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get me on board with this
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
you need to put some big guard rails on
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
this because it um
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
this gets abused in other states and i i
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't like that bluntly um that you have
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
to have if there's stability of
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
government issues underlying that if
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
you're just constantly making runs at it
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
um but i i think when you have those
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
once again when you have those long
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
terms and they're out of reach and
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse um that's a problem
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
but i want to put it you know within
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
reach but not you know oh it's tuesday
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
i'm going to wake up and i'm going to
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
recall my school remember
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
prudhomme o'brien
 
01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
prudhomme o'brien
so

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
earlier you this is a follow-up to what
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
you said about the board in litchfield
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
and that they
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
experienced some disappointed parents
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
and then they went and talked about the
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
situation they weren't you thought they
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
weren't um responsive you said they went
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
into executive session did you mean
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
non-public session correct i'm sorry
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
non-public section that's what i feel
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry non-public section yes
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
they went at
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
section i apologize yes they were that's
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
what that's exactly what i meant
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm in legislative mode what can i say
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.710 align:start position:0%
further questions
i

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative barry that i have a
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
question in regards to clarification
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
um if you look at line 10 page one
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
and also five and six a local elected
 
01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:21.109 align:start position:0%
and also five and six a local elected
official

01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
official
 
01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:22.069 align:start position:0%
official
so

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
is the intent that this would not be
 
01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
is the intent that this would not be
a

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
a
senator

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the u.s senate owned yes no it is not
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
a congressional official to the u.s
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
congress correct so it is only um yes
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is a hundred percent the attempt it
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
is only for um local elected officials
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
it is not for congress is not for every
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
two years but it would not be for you a
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
senate president i guess if you wanted
 
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.390 align:start position:0%
senate president i guess if you wanted
to

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
can't do that um recall that that'd be
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
an interesting concept we're going to
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
recall our electors
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
that'd be a fun little exercise where's
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
your head when you need him um
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
all right so in follow-up to that
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
you were trying to put guardrails on
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
this for
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
essentially local officials that would
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
appear on a ballot
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
generally speaking not in september or
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
november usually those are
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
municipal run elections that occur
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere between march and i think june
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
is the last date you can have
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
my question is why were the was the
 
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
my question is why were the was the
signature

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
signature
 
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.510 align:start position:0%
signature
requirement

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.390 align:start position:0%
requirement
based

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
based
on

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
registration at the time of the general
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
election is that a is that a function of
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
checklist maintenance or or if we're
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
talking about local elections yeah um
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's a function of me demanding a high
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
bar to execute it um because
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
i understand what this i understand the
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
ramifications of of this concept um and
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
i i was trying to make it as palatable
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
while still achieving the underlying
 
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
while still achieving the underlying
goal

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i understand that then no matter
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
what we do there will be members who
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't support this
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
but i did make a good faith effort on my
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
end in talking with joe like you need to
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
do x y and z um because otherwise it's
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
just going to get wrapped up as a
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
partisan bill and and getting to put in
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
that bin it wasn't my intention to do
 
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.870 align:start position:0%
that bin it wasn't my intention to do
that

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
questions i'm not seeing any thank you
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
very much for
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill also signed up to
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair nate graves for
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
again um i should have mentioned in my
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
prior testimony and i will now can you
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
get a little closer to the mic i
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
actually texted to make sure that you
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
could be heard and sure
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i do have written testimony which was
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
submitted online so hopefully you've had
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review that
 
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.950 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review that
um

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
i i guess
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
preliminarily my
 
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.150 align:start position:0%
preliminarily my
question

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
if the intent of the sponsors is that
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
they like new hampshire's traditional
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
election cycle of a two-year cycle
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just adjust everyone's
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
terms to be two years rather than have a
 
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.670 align:start position:0%
terms to be two years rather than have a
recall

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer to that but that
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
i was just throwing that out there
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm pointing that out because the
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill is is somewhat arbitrary
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
as uh i'm sure many of you know
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are local options for how long
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
local officials serve terms so for
 
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.630 align:start position:0%
local officials serve terms so for
example

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
clerks and treasurers
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
typically serve a term of one year
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
unless the town has opted for a
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
three-year term
 
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.029 align:start position:0%
three-year term
similarly

01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
a highway agent who is elected either
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
serves one two or three years so
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
at the local level you you end up making
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
that decision about what's appropriate
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
for your town for at least some
 
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.829 align:start position:0%
for your town for at least some
positions

01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
depending on what decision you make if
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
this bill were to go into effect that
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
person may or may not be subject to a
 
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
person may or may not be subject to a
recall

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
there really isn't
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
anything that ties the
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
officials performance
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
of their duties to the recall um so
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
while they while an allegation does have
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
to be made about
 
01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:38.710 align:start position:0%
to be made about
um

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
or a statement made about the recall
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't necessarily tie to
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
what their action is so
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know it could be the case that
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
someone does
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
spend that first 180 days to gather
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
signatures and then on day 181 file it
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh against the
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
official and it could be the loser in
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
the in the election um so we're
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
concerned certainly about the
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
possibility of abuse here
 
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.069 align:start position:0%
possibility of abuse here
um

01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that's really
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
the the major the major point um besides
 
01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:16.150 align:start position:0%
the the major the major point um besides
that

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're also concerned about holding these
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
special elections certainly if it is
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
ends up uh being abused i'm not saying
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's the case but if it is something
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
that ends up being abused
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you end up having to have special
 
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
and you end up having to have special
elections

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know those those elections are going
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
to cost money you're going to have to
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
find volunteers to perform the elections
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to you know call
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
out the moderator and everyone else
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
and the cost of that range ranges um so
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
small towns typically cost a couple
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to run an election
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
um but a larger one is going to be about
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
ten thousand or more
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
and so that can add up pretty quickly uh
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
and municipalities are may have to start
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
budgeting for
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know some
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
some routine amount of money to to hold
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you for coming
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
that is the the last pink card that i
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
we did have remote testimony
 
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.710 align:start position:0%

01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
merrimack district nine
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
so this measure is very simple short and
 
01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
so this measure is very simple short and
sweet

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
sweet
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and it's simply amends rsa 659 colon
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
73 section 4 by inserting subparagraph j
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
as follows and that so that would be
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph k
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
and it simply says for each election
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
contest or ballot question the number of
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
machine counted overvotes
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i have i did send or try to send
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
the entire committee electronically this
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
late last night so it you should have
 
01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.030 align:start position:0%
late last night so it you should have
that

01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
so a cup some quick bullets uh this bill
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
is intended to provide the number of
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
machine counted over votes over votes
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
for each race on the ballot where an
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting device is in
 
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting device is in
use

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently only a total number of
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
overvotes for each machine is available
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
to my understanding
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
so the only way to see which race or
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
races head over votes is with recounts
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
or a special audit
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
by hand
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
so this allows every candidate to see
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
how many machine counted overvotes
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
occurred in their race
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
and this can be very helpful in deciding
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not to file a recount and if
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
we don't need a recount then that saves
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
as you know a whole lot of time and
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
energy in expense
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
in derry
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
in november 2020 they reported over 500
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
overvotes on the machine that was used
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively for absentee ballots which
 
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.030 align:start position:0%
exclusively for absentee ballots which
was

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
became a concern
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to know which race or
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
races had over 500 votes that were lost
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
in that particular machine
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
and and again back to to windom again
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
the audit there showed that folded
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
ballots are a problem and that's the
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
measure that i introduced to this
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee last week
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
regarding folded ballots
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
in this case attributed to ballots not
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
being folded the right way
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill if it had been in effect
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
earlier would have shown the miscount in
 
01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
earlier would have shown the miscount in
windham

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
windham
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
was mostly for the representative race
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
it would have saved
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
needing to
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
to count all the other races
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would not apply to hand count
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
towns nor would it apply to hand-counted
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
ballots in machine count
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh towns and cities and
 
01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh towns and cities and
in

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
voting areas
 
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
voting areas
so

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is important if we continue to
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
use ballot counting machines i know
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's a measuring to do away with them
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that's something this committee will
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
deal with but especially if we continue
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
to put folded ballots into these
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
machines this bill becomes even more
 
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
machines this bill becomes even more
important

01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
important
and

01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'll try to take one question if while
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here if there is one
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
moffett who clearly has had enough of
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chairman uh
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh muffet thanks for
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me what an overvote
 
01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.310 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me what an overvote
is

01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
when the ballots are counted uh
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there are
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
you have a certain number of uh
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
registered voters and
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.430 align:start position:0%
registered voters and
overvotes

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
overvotes
 
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.229 align:start position:0%
overvotes
are

01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
particularly with machine basically it's
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
a function of machines the
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
number of votes don't line up uh
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're not in sync with the
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
number of voters
 
01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:04.149 align:start position:0%
number of voters
and

01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
that could
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be someone following me i know
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh alvin c who's here a lot uh had
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
worked with me in the languages he can
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
speak to that as well
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what the overvote issue
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
involves and how it's constituted or
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.790 align:start position:0%
involves and how it's constituted or
defined

01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
not the best answer but there's other
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
folks coming
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i thank you so much for your
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility actually right on time so
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming representative
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will step off
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
all right uh the only other pink card i
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
have for this is alvin c if alvin
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is alvin c i live in
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
loudoun i'm here
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and no organization
 
01:37:11.199 --> 01:37:13.669 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and no organization
and

01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
let me start off with the overvote
 
01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
let me start off with the overvote
is

01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
say for governor it says vote for
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
no more than one
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
if you vote for two that's an overvote
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
for say a representative race where it
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
says vote for no more than four
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
if you vote for five that's an overvote
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you vote for three that's an
 
01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
if you vote for three that's an
undervote

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
undervote
 
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
undervote
um

01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so alvin just mr c just to continue
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
the description for people who are not
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
aware because i think generally
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee members are
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
what happens when there's an overvote in
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
a machine
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
in the machines
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
if it senses an overvote that you voted
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
for too many
 
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.149 align:start position:0%
for too many
it

01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
just shows that it
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
records that as a zero for that office
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
so if it thinks you voted for five
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
which was more than the four you should
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
have voted for then none of those four
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
get a vote
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you undervote those
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
if you undervoted and only put in three
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.679 --> 01:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.629 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
when when ballots are hand counted
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
the effect of an overvote
 
01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
the effect of an overvote
is

01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
is still the same
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
the reason being that the voters intent
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be determined
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay just i just want to make sure we
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
are all talking about the same thing as
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
we proceed thank you all right yeah and
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
in the case of of windham
 
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
there were uh the machine because the
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
ballots were
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
through the target ovals
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's where the machine
 
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.350 align:start position:0%
that's where the machine
misinterpreted

01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
as votes or
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
not votes
 
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
not votes
and

01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the hand counted ballots
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's a hand count town or a
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
machine countdown the hand counted
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
ballots there
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're not worried about those because
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
those will have already had human eyes
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking at them trying to determine
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.639 --> 01:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to suggest that this should
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
also apply to the
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
new ballot counting devices that the
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
town of milford recently received
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
permission to test this year
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
those machines will actually take a
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
digital image of the ballot
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then process the digital
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
result to find
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
where the votes were
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
and give a result but we need to find
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
any quirkiness in the new machines
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
before they get too far
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
in use
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
and also the effective date if this bill
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
passes it should be for this year's
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
state primary and general election
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions if
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you great madam chair and
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr c for taking my question
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm still confused can you pull the mic
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
a little closer i'm just being sort of
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about things can you hear me
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
now yeah no that's a little bit okay i'm
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
confused because
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
the accu-vote machines that we use in
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
portsmouth do count the overvotes
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
so what it what is the uh
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
what is it that i'm missing here in the
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
case of the uh way the accuvope machines
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
are currently programmed it gives you a
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
summary of of any overvotes on the
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
entire ballot
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
so you don't know whether it was for
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
state rep or for governor
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
or county commissioner
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
it just says at the top on the header
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
that there were so many people voted
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
there were so many
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
total overvotes counted but it doesn't
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
say which office
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
what this is doing
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
is to have the machines programmed
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
for each office
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
not only give you the
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
vote count for each of the candidates
 
01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.590 align:start position:0%
vote count for each of the candidates
plus

01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
any write-ins
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
and number of blanks because some people
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't vote for all offices
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
but it also add in there the number of
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
overvotes that the machine counted in
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
that particular race
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
so it'll tell you if there's an
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
overvotes for
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
president or governor or state rep
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
or county commissioner
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you can use that information if if
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
you lose a race by say 50 votes and you
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
see there their 75
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
overvotes recorded it'd be worth your
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
while to ask for a recount
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah follow-up um
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
so but i thought that they do list the
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
overvotes for each
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
for each race so you mean they
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
you should list the overvotes for each
 
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
you should list the overvotes for each
candidate

01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes well for each race for governor
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
it would say how many overvotes there
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
right if you've got two candidates for
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
governor it doesn't say how many
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
overvotes for sununu and how many
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
overvotes for
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh pelties
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you mean for each candidate
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
well as opposed to each race
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
no it would be each race for each race
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
because you can't
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
just if the with the committees indus
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a governor's race sununu
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
and feltus yes somebody fills out both
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
ovals yes it will have a total for
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
sununu a total for feltus those would be
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the ballots with one clear bullet
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
filled in once
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
blanks

01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
blanks
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes and it will have a number so it
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
can't it can't do it by candidate it has
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
to do it by race
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
because that's the tally is by race not
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
by individual
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay i thought we'd do it by race
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
already but maybe um
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
no i think
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony is we do not do it by race
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a total at the top of the
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
tape for the machine that's correct
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
right and also this should include any
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.270 align:start position:0%

01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
terozian
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr c for
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
taking the question so the older
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
machines that are in use the active vote
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
and some of the others
 
01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.149 align:start position:0%
and some of the others
um

01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
set up can they be programmed to do that
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
to give the breakdown for each race
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes the um in the
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal report
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph the secretary of
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
state's office indicated that
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's just that the
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
state for whatever reason had chosen not
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
to implement that
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
most other states do
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee
 
01:44:31.119 --> 01:44:34.470 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee

01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.709 align:start position:0%
it was
okay

01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a copy of um the tape
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
from our last election in manchester
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
ward 10.
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
um blanks is the first

um blanks is the first
item

01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
the ward 10 school committee which my
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
husband was
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the winner
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
blanks was 151
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
my husband
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
752 and then the other candidate was
 
01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.070 align:start position:0%
752 and then the other candidate was
662.

01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
662.
 
01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.629 align:start position:0%
662.
666

01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
666
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
write-ins two
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
so isn't that
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
the blanks for that
 
01:45:13.199 --> 01:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
the blanks for that
office

01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
right so the blanks as my understanding
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
includes people who didn't vote right
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
because you have a right to not vote and
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
the overvotes the it so the blanks is
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
the equivalent
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state's here i'm
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
sort of looking over here is the blanks
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
is essentially the number of ballots for
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
which there was no
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
vote recorded
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
either because the voter did not fill it
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
out at all
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
or it was filled out in a manner that
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
the machine determined there were too
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
many choices made
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
and right now the way the tape is
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
presented you can't tell the difference
 
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
presented you can't tell the difference
between

01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
where the voter intentionally did not
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
fill in a circle or did it incorrectly
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
am i getting that right
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
perfect okay the machine doesn't have
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to determine voter intent
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on 1470 is ken
 
01:46:26.239 --> 01:46:37.189 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on 1470 is ken
eyring

01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
i don't have too much to add i agree
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
with everything that was said
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh for me this is an election integrity
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue and
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
after the november third election
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned yesterday a lot of people
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the fence this is
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
i've expressed concerns and wanting to
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we tighten up our
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
elections so that
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
voters will have confidence in them
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
i live in wyndham so i'm very familiar
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
with what took place
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
there regarding the elections and the
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of overvotes on one of
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
our machines
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and those overvotes were
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
were caused by
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know ballot folds being in the wrong
 
01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.629 align:start position:0%
you know ballot folds being in the wrong
place

01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
now this bill
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
won't address
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that those particular
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
malfunctions in the machine
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
will correct the results of a particular
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
election because the paper tapes are
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
printed at the end of the day
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
but what it does do is it makes it very
 
01:47:42.639 --> 01:47:44.950 align:start position:0%
but what it does do is it makes it very
clear

01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
some more details as to why the
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
overvotes occurred and where they
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
occurred so it allows
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
election officials in each town if there
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
are an exorbitant amount of overvotes
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
to troubleshoot and see where the issues
 
01:47:58.159 --> 01:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
to troubleshoot and see where the issues
are

01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
and in windham we had one machine
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that had
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of overvotes 292. so
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
for 292 people
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
who went in and voted assuming that all
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
of those were machine malfunctions
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i would have to i would bet that a
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
that it would have been very very
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
helpful to know
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
at the point at the end of the day that
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
all of those overvotes or a vast
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
majority of them were related to the
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
state rep race
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
and when you go and you look at
 
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.030 align:start position:0%
and when you go and you look at
secretary

01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
of state bill gardner at the time and
 
01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.669 align:start position:0%
of state bill gardner at the time and
secretary

01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
scanlan who was here they ran the
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
recount and i was there
 
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
recount and i was there
and

01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
their results which and they handled
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
that very very well their results showed
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
that there was approximately 300 votes
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
for every republican candidate plus or
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
minus three votes that were not awarded
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
to the republican candidates
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
on election day by the machines
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
and then the leading democrat
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh candidate was awarded an extra 99
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
votes on election day so there was a
 
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.830 align:start position:0%
votes on election day so there was a
swing

01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
swing
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
of from a a losing margin of 24 votes on
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
election day to 420 votes
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
after the recount
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
and like i said this is not just a
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue because if
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
you go to a town like
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
um like sandown
 
01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.149 align:start position:0%
um like sandown
uh

01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
it appears that the same type of issue
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
happened there
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
and so we have to but
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of the republicans because
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you know
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
the ballots are set up with three
 
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.669 align:start position:0%
the ballots are set up with three
columns

01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
columns
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the party in each column
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's a third a third a third and they
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
shift every year
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
and according to the
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
audit that took place on the window
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
machines trying to figure out what was
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
wrong with the problem
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh they
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
they discovered that
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
the particular machine that had this
 
01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:11.830 align:start position:0%
the particular machine that had this
issue

01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
it was it had more of a susceptibility
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
to have the issue in the center column
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:50:21.199 --> 01:50:22.070 align:start position:0%
you know
to

01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
wrap this up i just believe it would be
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
very very helpful for it's a tool
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
essentially for our moderators
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they can then after the fact go
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
and have somebody look at this and they
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
can actually uh
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know determine whether or not
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's issues and as um
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
as mr c pointed out it also would make
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
it a tool for the candidates because in
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
the case of uh
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
of wyndham where there was an enormous
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
amount of overvotes if if you're all
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
running for election
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether you want you know if you lose by
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
a certain number and the overvotes are
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
some magnitude greater than that you
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
know that there's a potential for the
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
machines to have failed and it's only
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
right for you to then go
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
and ask for a recount to make sure that
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
they were that the votes were counted
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
properly by the machines so thank you
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
very much for your time i appreciate
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
everything that you do for our state any
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
morning good morning chairman griffin
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the time to
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
speak about this one
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
november 6 i mean november 3rd election
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
i have no clue what an overvote means
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i attended
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
that 15 days of the um
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
forensic audit of windham i've learned a
 
01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.510 align:start position:0%
forensic audit of windham i've learned a
lot

01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i saw many familiar faces here that
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
circled that place too because
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
i did not know that the machine can take
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
your ballot but it doesn't count
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and with the amount of like 300 per
 
01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.270 align:start position:0%
and with the amount of like 300 per
candidate

01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
in windham
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
without a hand recount you wouldn't know
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the person who requested that
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
recalls is a democrat even though the
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
republican won there so
 
01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:21.990 align:start position:0%
republican won there so
um

01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
these machines have problem and i
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
testified last week that
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to get rid of all of the
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
voting machine because
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
if people have the result less than a
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
certain margin they wouldn't do the
 
01:52:36.639 --> 01:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
certain margin they wouldn't do the
recount

01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
recount
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't imagine that it would be
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
like 300
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
without that sp
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the bills
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
to have that recount so
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
preferably we get rid of all the machine
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
if it has to be still there
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
then please sort it out so that
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
we know which machine because i've
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
circled a lot of elections after that
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
and a certain machine place a certain
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
place in the election that is meant just
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
to feed
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and the ballers and
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
from what i hear which i cannot verify
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of funny businesses going
 
01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.870 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of funny businesses going
on

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
and in election integrity that is why
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
i've been camping here for the last few
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
days and last week because i lost faith
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
in our election process and i don't
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
believe that my vote matters anymore
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why we need to take this small
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
step to allow the people in that process
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
at that time to check and at the end of
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
the resolve the election
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the candidate
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
had the tool to determine and somehow in
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
the future if the candidate choose not
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
to have the recount the public
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
who support those candidates should have
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to do so because right after
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
the election of november i asked many
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
people to do recall and they say no no
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that because we have
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
to rerun
 
01:54:09.599 --> 01:54:10.629 align:start position:0%
to rerun
why

01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
the result is not right doesn't matter
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
how many times you run it's not going to
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
be right if there's something wrong in
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
there that we don't fix which we did not
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
check we could not check it
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
so the public should have the ability to
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
inspect it because the candidate afraid
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
of their reputation and their stigma or
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
whatever that going on with it so they
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
won't risk that but we the people lost
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
that vote
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
and that's faith so we need to be able
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
to inspect to make sure that it's
 
01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.149 align:start position:0%
to inspect to make sure that it's
accurate

01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i ask you to please support this bill
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
restore the faith of the voters
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
and to keep us fit with the first in the
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
nation status
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%

01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you for testimony
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
that was the last speaker i had signed
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
up on hb 1470 there were persons who
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
signed up remotely in position on 1470.
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
i have 16
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%

quick question answered by the secretary
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
whatever time i want in this room and i
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
can reopen something that might have
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
just for a nanosecond been closed
 
01:56:08.719 --> 01:56:09.669 align:start position:0%
just for a nanosecond been closed
um

01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
if the sec if the secretary of state or
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
another member of the office wants to um
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
come up to why don't you tell us what
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
the question is and then they can decide
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
who should come up to him
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
the question is uh one of the things
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
that was said
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the testimony was that
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is just a programming issue
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
for existing
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh machines
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct or do we need to
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was if you were just watching that
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
was what you would refer to as passing
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
the buck i think down there between
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
those three individuals
 
01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.229 align:start position:0%
those three individuals
um

01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
so let's see i just gave it a little
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
more time for the short straw to come
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning madam chair and
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members uh as far as
 
01:56:59.119 --> 01:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members uh as far as
your

01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
question representative i know within
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that state that the airs
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
we would have to definitely verify with
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
lhs that it can definitely be turned on
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
for each machine um even as a clerk i
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't remember whether or not it was
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
able to be turned on to the machine so
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
this question that i definitely would
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
want to pose to our vendor
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
so do you think you could pose that
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
question to the vendor so we have an
 
01:57:21.199 --> 01:57:22.310 align:start position:0%
question to the vendor so we have an
answer

01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%

01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
i couldn't exit into the hall the other
 
01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.149 align:start position:0%
i couldn't exit into the hall the other
day

01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
from my committee
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and but i'm here i'm not here to talk
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
about fraud or fake or any elections
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that i'm here to talk
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
about transparency accountability and
 
01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
about transparency accountability and
reproducibility

01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
reproducibility
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
this is what happens after the election
 
01:59:10.719 --> 01:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
this is what happens after the election
the

01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
voters ballots get stored in boxes the
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
boxes get stored in towns they use
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's no uniformity every town does
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
their own thing they may be stored they
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
may not be stored somebody may be
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
singing on them
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
who knows what
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.910 align:start position:0%
so um
there's

01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of bills coming forward
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
probably that deal with audits and um
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
recounts for the ballot so i believe
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's in our best interest to keep those
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
ballots and boxes secure after the
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
election so we can look at them we can
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
reproduce the results
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
so my bill calls for the storage of
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
these boxes for the boxes to be
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
safely moved to
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
probably concord to a secure location so
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
they can be kept there after the
 
01:59:54.159 --> 01:59:56.790 align:start position:0%
they can be kept there after the
election

01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
this way we can provide the utmost care
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
for the boxes we can satisfy the voters
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
that everything possible is being done
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:00:07.119 --> 02:00:09.109 align:start position:0%
to the
ballots

02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
as submitted
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
in in a couple of elections in this
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
recent cycle bedford is a prime example
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
where uh ballots were discovered after
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
the election months after the election
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
the public only learned about such
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
instances a year down the road this is
 
02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:27.070 align:start position:0%
instances a year down the road this is
really

02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
irresponsible my bill would prevent that
 
02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
irresponsible my bill would prevent that
um

02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is yeah that's that's about all i
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
have um the only change or the only
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
concern that i have in the bill is that
 
02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:42.790 align:start position:0%
concern that i have in the bill is that
it

02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note they say that the
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
boxes will be stored
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
permanently and that's not something i
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
desired but
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
so i am for
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
storing of boxes for
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
up to two years
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think the way it's done today
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
so that they don't need to be stored
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
permanently that obviously will
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so it wasn't your
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
intent to change the storage requirement
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
the time period no no it was not
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so thank you very
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
much for coming and introducing the bill
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
hi thank you again for the chance to
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
02:01:53.119 --> 02:01:54.070 align:start position:0%
speak on this
um

02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
when i first read this bill
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
a few months ago or whenever yeah a few
 
02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
i was i was up in the air because i'm a
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
true believer in local control
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that having our ballots
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
in multiple places you know under
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
different people i think that helps
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
normally with election integrity
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
but after the report from the ag's
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
office and the secretary of state's
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
office that was
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
sent out the letter that was sent to
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
local election officials in windham
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
regarding their handling of the november
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
3rd 2020 election
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's an 11-page report
 
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
it's an 11-page report
it

02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.270 align:start position:0%
it
identifies

02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
identifies
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
multiple violations of law multiple
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
violations of the
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
procedures for handling the ballots
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
and running the election and it's very
 
02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
and running the election and it's very
disturbing

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that in light of that of
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
my opinion has shifted towards it it
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
might be better
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
overseen by the secretary of state's
 
02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.709 align:start position:0%
overseen by the secretary of state's
office

02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
because it allows it would allow them to
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
see some of these issues
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
firsthand for instance
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm going off the top of my head so
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
if you read the report or if you read
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
the report
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i get some of these things wrong
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's just the intent that i'm trying to
 
02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:16.629 align:start position:0%
it's just the intent that i'm trying to
infer

02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
infer
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
but i think there were half a dozen
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
boxes that weren't even sealed properly
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
there were others that didn't have
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
the security tape on them there were
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
others that didn't have signatures on
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
the security tape i mean these are
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
these are severe in my opinion
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
violations of the law because you want
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that when the ballots go into
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
the boxes and then they're sealed
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
that they're sealed and
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
with tamper-proof tape so that you can
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
you can have some kind of confidence
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they're being stored and handled
 
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.270 align:start position:0%
that they're being stored and handled
properly

02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you know i don't mean to be critical
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
of of anybody in particular i'm deciding
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
what was written in their report
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
and there are issues there so
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the sense of if you trans if you have
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
the each town transfer those boxes up to
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office and any
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
and there are any irregularities with
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
the handling of the ballots and the
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
boxes the secretary of state's office
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be immediately aware of that
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
and they could notify the town and they
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
could provide proper training to make
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
sure that in the future
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
those ballots were handled properly the
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
boxes were sealed properly with all the
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.189 align:start position:0%
you know um
um

02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
tamper proof tape and and all the
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
signatures and and whatnot so that's all
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
i had to offer you know thank you again
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
mr eyring i actually have a couple since
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
you volunteered that you're from wyndham
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
and you're aware of the 11-page letter
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.550 align:start position:0%
and you're aware of the 11-page letter
um

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things in windham that was
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
found is that the boxes that were
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
provided by the secretary of state's
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
office to to
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
package store the ballots in after
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
they were used were not used and the
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
wyndham officials swore that those boxes
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
were not delivered until after the
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
election and in fact the letter
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
discloses that there's a receipt that
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
they were delivered days before the
 
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
they were delivered days before the
election

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
would your bill correct that kind of
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
conduct well you know
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's not your bill it would this bill
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
correct that kind of conduct well it
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
would make
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
the state officials aware
 
02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.030 align:start position:0%
the state officials aware
immediately

02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the boxes were not used
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay clearly they were delivered on time
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
because they have receipts
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
so you know whatever happened in wyndham
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the reasons are they didn't use
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
it i can't speak on that but that's one
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh violations you know our law
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
says you have to you know our town
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
officials election officials have to use
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the boxes that are provided by the
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and they weren't so
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to the other issues i
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
brought up they didn't use the proper
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
boxes as well and then the secretary of
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
state's office could address that type
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
of issue immediately
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
and make sure in the future
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
that they are used because there's
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
reasons for all of these laws they add
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
to the integrity of our elections and
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
the storage of the ballots so that you
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
would have the state same response in
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
regards to the failure to seal the boxes
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
properly and the failure to sign the
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
seal on the boxes properly yeah
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely and for me that's really
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
disturbing i'm really disturbing you
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
know there's absolutely no no reason why
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
our ballots
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
once they're put into permanent storage
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
which is on election night
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
and opened only currently only in the
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
event of
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
a recount they should be
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
stored as defined by law and that was
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
not followed so
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
um in in essence i look at this as a
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
tool for for ensuring
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
that our ballots are stored properly and
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
that they're they're given the type of
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
due diligence
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
according to the law
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it puts the secretary of state's
 
02:07:03.599 --> 02:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
and it puts the secretary of state's
people

02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
in a position where they can help i'm
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
not looking to penalize anybody or to
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
say that you know people should be
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
removed from their positions i'm why not
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to ask well if the state
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
incurred thousands and thousands of
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
dollars in costs for an audit that
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
appears to have been caused by people
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
not doing their job i'm glad you said
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
that in the case of windham i have a
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
different opinion
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
but for this bill
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking there i'm not trying to
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
suggest that the secretary of state's
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
office should be there with an iron fist
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and come down on all the towns
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be you know
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
human error people have you know they
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
don't they make mistakes we all make
 
02:07:45.199 --> 02:07:46.229 align:start position:0%
don't they make mistakes we all make
mistakes

02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's a tool to to help ensure that our
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
ballots are going to be properly managed
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a good idea and
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't feel strongly about that until
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
i saw that report and if you haven't
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
read the report
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
i strongly suggest that you take time to
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
read it it's 11 pages but it's it's a
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
pretty quick read
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee members have a copy of it
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for mr
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
eyring and thank you all for indulging
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
the chair representative prudhomme
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
o'brien thank you
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh i know that you've been very active
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.079 --> 02:08:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is a yeah my question is
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
do you think that there's awareness in
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
your community that there is an upcoming
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
election i mean
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
i don't live in windham so i'm i'm
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm assuming there is because there
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
isn't and derry is there an upcoming
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
election for
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
clerk and and moderator and is there a
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
lack of awareness in your community that
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
other people can
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
run for those positions and
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
what's happening well i don't know who's
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to run
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
i believe one of our moderator positions
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
is open
 
02:08:55.679 --> 02:08:56.709 align:start position:0%
is open
and

02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
i don't believe currently that a lot of
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
people in windham are aware of the
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
issues but i intend to you know do my
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
best to make sure that people are aware
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
by just putting out the facts and
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
letting people come to their own
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
conclusions but as
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
chairwoman griffin pointed out it was an
 
02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
chairwoman griffin pointed out it was an
enormous

02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
enormous
endeavor

02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
endeavor
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
to go through uh the
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
what we went through trying to figure
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
out what happened
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know with
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
with the election results from 11 3 and
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
then all of the subsequent
 
02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:30.390 align:start position:0%
then all of the subsequent
irregularities

02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
irregularities
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
and and there's it's not just that there
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
are other issues regarding with how the
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
elections are run but that's not germane
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
to this bill so i won't bring them up
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%

02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you committee um christina gilford
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
derry town and school moderator i
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't going to speak on this
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
bill but the more i look at it the more
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
i have an issue here
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
and it's probably a very easy issue to
 
02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:09.669 align:start position:0%
and it's probably a very easy issue to
correct

02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
um there is something here in this bill
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
that when a
 
02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:16.470 align:start position:0%
that when a
um

02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot comes in late
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the clerk should just destroy it
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
they enter in an election net and they
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
destroy it
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i do not think that anything of this
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
nature should be destroyed i mean we're
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
talking about election integrity here
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's what everybody wants
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
um i think that either the town clerk
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
should retain them
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever the holding period is
 
02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:43.270 align:start position:0%
for whatever the holding period is
or

02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
um something should be worked out but
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
just to
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
have the say so of the town clerk yep it
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
came in late rip up an envelope i mean
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
somebody still voted even if it came in
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
late and it didn't get counted this
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
should it should still be held with
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't like just destroying him and
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
throwing them in the trash it just seems
 
02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.390 align:start position:0%
throwing them in the trash it just seems
wrong

02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
questions for members of the committee
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman i
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
what this would do if there were
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
a local recount
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
if you're shipping your ballots all the
 
02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
if you're shipping your ballots all the
way

02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:32.229 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
well

02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we don't send any
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
ballots for local elections to the
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.950 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
um

02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
if it all they all go to concord then i
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
guess the secretary of state's office
 
02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
would have to handle any local recounts
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
they would have the ballots
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you but i think this bill is just
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
for state and general elections but i
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
might have missed that
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
further questions representative barry
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
just more of a clarifying i think it's
 
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
just more of a clarifying i think it's
uh

02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
the line two of the bill in any state
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
election i guess
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
in any state election
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
so i believe this only deals with state
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
elections i can't speak for this for the
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors but
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
well i
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
i think somebody from the secretary of
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
state's office is going to testify and
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like clarification of that because
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
that first paragraph of the bill deals
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
with absentee votes so the actual
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
transport i want to make sure we need
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarification on what that applies to
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.589 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i am
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
i saw this is a big problem
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
windham audit
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
is because the first day
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
all those boxes that got in there
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
one of the observer
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
linda brown
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
from i think
 
02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
from i think
sandow

02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
sandow
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
she was checking and trying to take
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
picture of all these blocks to compare
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the list the change of custody list
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
and there's one box that has the same
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
number with another box
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
and she has been trying
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
to ask all these officials the three
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
auditors there
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
for that whole time and i have video
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
eyewitnesses because like i said i was
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
there every day for 15 days
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
from open to close
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
she'd been trying to get them to clarify
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
that and they couldn't they wouldn't
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
they keep avoiding her
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
so on the last day
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
she stopped
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state garnier
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
and talked to him and asked him to help
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
her identify that box she had pictures
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
she printed out in color at the whole
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
video of that i posted on youtube people
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
watching it and let me tell you what the
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
face in the elections like just go
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
sinking down
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
and he promised to try to get it back to
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
her but there's nothing back okay so
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem with the change of
 
02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:19.189 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem with the change of
custody

02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
custody
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
because if you have let's say 20 boxes
 
02:14:22.159 --> 02:14:23.109 align:start position:0%
because if you have let's say 20 boxes
in

02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
all the supplies and other ballasts and
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
now you have a box that has the same
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
number with the other one then what's in
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know so if the input is not correct
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's wrong then the result output is not
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to be correct
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
how can you
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
do a forensic audit when you cannot
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
verify all this as an observer
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
there i was there and to be honest with
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
you i have no clue what to look for as i
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
walk in there myself i'm in the first
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
week the visibility on the screen you
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
cannot see anything it's chaotic in
 
02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:00.709 align:start position:0%
cannot see anything it's chaotic in
there

02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's zigzag all over the place you
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
cannot see anything
 
02:15:04.719 --> 02:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
cannot see anything
so

02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
this change of custody is a it's an
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
issue that we need to support this bill
 
02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.149 align:start position:0%
issue that we need to support this bill
1457

02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
1457
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
to make it clear and i've attended right
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
after november election i've attended
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
helping with the recall of one or two of
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
the recalls and a few more right after
 
02:15:21.599 --> 02:15:22.709 align:start position:0%
the recalls and a few more right after
that

02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and you know those boxes of balance
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
are piling on each other
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
the tape the red tape that you think
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
that if you open it will rip the thing
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
no you peel it open and you can just put
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
it right back over
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
so like what's the point of this red
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
tape that you put it over to seal
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
that you can just open like it's no seal
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
what's the point of those seals
 
02:15:48.719 --> 02:15:49.589 align:start position:0%
what's the point of those seals
right

02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
and then in the bedford election
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
special election a few months ago i was
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
there trying to observe it
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's way at the end you cannot see and
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
only one guy
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
tried to like get all the balance out by
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
himself and do whatever in the back we
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
cannot see because way at the end by
 
02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.470 align:start position:0%
cannot see because way at the end by
himself

02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
himself
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
who watching all those things
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
do we know for sure if all the ballast
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
out of that box of that machine no and
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
then it went over to this table and then
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
some people go over there do something
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
box something put at the bottom at the
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
floor and then somebody else come over
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
and do that and they keep watching those
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
boxes because to me those are goals
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the result is we have to rely
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
on these boxes of balance to ensure that
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
we have the right result
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
but the change of custody of handling
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
the balance during the process is so
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
confusing there's no double checking and
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
i attended the very uh special election
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
that the tina was there and i said she's
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
doing a great job because you know what
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
she invited all the people the candidate
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
and media and the public to stand close
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
to as they get the balance out of the
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
machine and show to us is empty
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know so it's it's transparent
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
process whatever the result comes out we
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
accept that
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
winning or losing it doesn't matter it
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
matters that our vote does matter that's
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
what it's important that's why i'm here
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
and a majority of my friends that they
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
cannot make it to be here
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
we honor it together really and speaking
 
02:17:28.639 --> 02:17:29.429 align:start position:0%
we honor it together really and speaking
for

02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
the face of the voters in our state
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
really we have no faith after november's
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
third election thank you ciao kelly so

watching this process so as much as you
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
have and bringing more attention to this
 
02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
have and bringing more attention to this
process

02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
have you been able to
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
watch the process of the boxes being
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
sealed the ballot boxes being sealed in
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
your own community during elections in
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
your own community and how did that go
 
02:18:08.319 --> 02:18:09.589 align:start position:0%
your own community and how did that go
um

02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
i'm in media so on election day i'm
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
usually running all over the places to
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
cover them
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
okay and i go and help people go to vote
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
i on 20 something years i always ask
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
people go register vote and help them to
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
go vote so i'm all over the places so i
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
cannot attend my local town but i attend
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
a republican meeting recently and we've
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
learned from the republican party that
 
02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:36.870 align:start position:0%
learned from the republican party that
we

02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
can have two
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's called
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
ballet um inspector or something like
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
that challenger
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
the party can appoint a two person that
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
we can go inside the ring
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
this bill has to do with transport of
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
boxes after the election so that's what
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on so yeah so i
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't observe that catherine thank
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%

committee i'm david scanlon secretary of
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
state and
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
i i would just like to say on this piece
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
of legislation that it it really goes to
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
the heart of probably the biggest
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
problem that we have facing elections
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
now and that is
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get a handle on the decline in
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in the election
 
02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.230 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in the election
process

02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
and to reestablish that we are going to
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
have to take steps
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
the general public the voters in our
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
state can understand
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
how we are protecting and preserving
 
02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.670 align:start position:0%
how we are protecting and preserving
ballots

02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh to their satisfaction so that they
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
can have faith in the process
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
we do have chain of custody with ballots
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
at the current time
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
it certainly is not perfect
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
we train local election officials on
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
but we also have a very high turnover
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with election
 
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:23.190 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with election
officials

02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
and they have to learn these things as
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
they as they come on board
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
those of you that have attended recounts
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
and have seen the boxes of ballots that
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
we are going to count
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
at a recount
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
have the red security tape on them
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably 80 of them maybe more are are
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
properly sealed as we train them but
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is al always a percentage of boxes
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
that don't quite
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
meet the standard that
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
some of the ways that we can resolve
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
that and and i think we are going to
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
implement this is just have spot visits
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis basis
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
hitting as many town clerks as possible
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
where we or the attorney general's
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
office or both of us just show up
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
unannounced and ask to see
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
how these materials are being stored
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
and we can grade them on that and and
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
help them
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
address any deficiencies
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
that might be out there
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that you know
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
we are not afraid to store all of these
 
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
we are not afraid to store all of these
materials

02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
materials
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
at the state archives but i can tell you
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
that that would be a monumental process
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
to make happen and
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
whenever we go out now and collect
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
ballots from the municipalities for a
 
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:44.389 align:start position:0%
ballots from the municipalities for a
recount

02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
recount
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
and and we bring in a lot of boxes even
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
though it's a
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
relatively small percentage of the
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
ballots that may have been used
 
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.270 align:start position:0%
ballots that may have been used
statewide

02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
number one we make sure that the boxes
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
are properly sealed
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
number two is that we put a barcode
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
on each box and identify the contents so
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
that we can keep track of those boxes
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
once they leave the clerk's office and
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
we receive them
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
at the archives and store them on
 
02:22:12.399 --> 02:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
at the archives and store them on
shelves

02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
shelves
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
that allows us to be able to go back and
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
retrieve those boxes when the time for
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
the recount comes
 
02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
the recount comes
to

02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
have a provision in the statute where
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours
 
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours
all

02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
materials associated with the election
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
have to be delivered to the archives
 
02:22:30.399 --> 02:22:31.349 align:start position:0%
have to be delivered to the archives
is

02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
just an unreal unrealistic
 
02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
just an unreal unrealistic
expectation

02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
i would need the national guard i think
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
to pull that off and and even then it
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be difficult
 
02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:42.070 align:start position:0%
would be difficult
um

02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
persons that testified earlier talked
 
02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.790 align:start position:0%
persons that testified earlier talked
about

02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
the destruction of absentee ballots that
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
are received by the clerk
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
in a federal election
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
which would be our state elections have
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be preserved for a period
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
of 22 months
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
and in the case of absentee ballots when
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
they are rejected and receiving them
 
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
after the deadline is a reason for
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
rejection we have to actually record
 
02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:08.550 align:start position:0%
rejection we have to actually record
those

02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
in election net and the voters
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
themselves can actually look up
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
on our website
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
the status of their absentee ballot
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
and they should be able to see that it
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
was received after the election
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that it was not counted because it
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
was rejected for that purpose
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
but bottom line is i believe the federal
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
law applies
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh to preserving those ballots for 22
 
02:23:30.479 --> 02:23:33.349 align:start position:0%
uh to preserving those ballots for 22
months

02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
and then the third issue
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor said that it wasn't his
 
02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:41.429 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor said that it wasn't his
intent

02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
to require the permanent preservation of
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
those ballots but if we can't destroy
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
them after the 22-month period and after
 
02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
them after the 22-month period and after
all

02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know legal issues have been settled
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
with any recounts or appeals or anything
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
that if we're unable to destroy those
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
ballots then
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're just going to sit around and you
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
know even though we
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
recently put a new addition on the
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
archives we have plenty of space now but
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:08.710 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
um

02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
during an election cycle we would we
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
would bring in
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
it could be as many as 5 000 boxes
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
per election cycle and that space will
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
fill up in a hurry
 
02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:20.150 align:start position:0%
fill up in a hurry
and

02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have to
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
look at other alternatives
 
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line i think that this is a is a
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
discussion that we need to have and i
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
think that there are things that we can
 
02:24:30.399 --> 02:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
think that there are things that we can
do

02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
relative to chain of custody that will
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
certainly help
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
the general public understand the
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
process better and have more confidence
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
in how that process works
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to answer any
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
for secretary scanlon
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you for being here
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
i like what you said about
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
doing spot visits and checking how boxes
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
are prepared by local officials can we
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
talk about the november 2020
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
general election
 
02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
general election
and

02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
in general what grade would you give to
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
election officials throughout the state
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
and what grade would you give to windham
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
election officials for how they prepared
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
boxes in the november 2020 general
 
02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
boxes in the november 2020 general
election

02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
some towns and cities do better than
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
others and
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
if i had to put
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
put a grade to that statewide
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
it would probably be a b
 
02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
it would probably be a b
um

02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
windham had their issues
 
02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:39.750 align:start position:0%
windham had their issues
and

02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know that the issues
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
are necessarily systemic in in windham
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at one election
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at an election that
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i think the primary reason for
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
issues the towns have had
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 is the direct result
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the volume of absentee ballots
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we had to deal with um in the case
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
of windham i mean they took a shortcut i
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
think they thought it was okay and you
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
know i think that their
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
their intentions were sincere but they
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
decided to use a letter folding machine
 
02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
decided to use a letter folding machine
to

02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
full balance and that's what caused the
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
problem with the oval
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know it was it was a measure that
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
was taken to deal with
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
the high volume of ballots in the case
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
of bedford
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
they had a huge volume of absentee
 
02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:35.349 align:start position:0%
they had a huge volume of absentee
ballots

02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
higher than the state average
 
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.630 align:start position:0%
higher than the state average
and

02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
and they just lost track of a of a
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
stack of
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that stack did not get
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
counted and
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
issues that developed out of that you
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
know are what they are but um
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know if it was a normal election i
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that we would have seen the
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
same issues uh that we saw as a result
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
which was difficult because of the
 
02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
which was difficult because of the
pandemic

02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
further question
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your diplomacy and
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
towards the town of windham and their
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
officials but i've been watching this
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
for a while and i saw those boxes come
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
out of windham and
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it's not crazy to
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
say that that grade would be an f
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
raise it as a question the grade would
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
have been lower than the the state
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
average yeah thank you thank you very
 
02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:38.150 align:start position:0%
average yeah thank you thank you very
much

02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
always diplomatic mr scott the teacher
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
every parent wants grading their child's
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
work representative barry
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
congratulations secretary scan that was
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
a very political answer um
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the record i would give windham an f
 
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
for the record i would give windham an f
minus

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
minus
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but to my point of question and to my
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
point my question at the beginning you
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
said voter integrity is going to be a
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
very high priority for your office i
 
02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
cannot express to you how
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
happy that makes me
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have an issue i've spoken to that
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
issue several times
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
you said in your testimony
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
that part of those integrity measures
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
that we're going to take to get people
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable voting again
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking at things like
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
this and you said
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily this bill but things
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
concerning ballot custody you talked
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
about spot checking was that what you're
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
referring about other measures or are
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are there other measures that your
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
office is considering um concerning
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
custody and and would it would it be
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
helpful if this
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
committee used this bill as a vehicle
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
for those for those
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
for those if they exist those other
 
02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
for those if they exist those other
measures

02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
measures
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think this bill would be very
 
02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:48.469 align:start position:0%
i think this bill would be very
appropriate

02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:28:48.479 --> 02:28:49.429 align:start position:0%
appropriate
for

02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on those measures
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
spot checks
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
is certainly part of that
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
there are different types of security
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
seals that are out there and maybe we
 
02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
seals that are out there and maybe we
can

02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
do better with you know having something
 
02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
do better with you know having something
that

02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know that will
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
give confidence that you know once the
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
boxes are closed after
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
the election is over that you know they
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been opened and and somehow
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
tampered with
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
right now we use red security tape um
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
that tape is designed so that if it's
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
lifted it shouldn't stick again when
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's laid back down
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
but also leaves an ink residue
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
on the box
 
02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know to show that
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know the tape had moved somehow
 
02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes that tape gets
 
02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:38.389 align:start position:0%
sometimes that tape gets
gets

02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
gets
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
disturbed just in the process of
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
handling boxes
 
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
handling boxes
and

02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know if that happens then it does
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
create doubt in a person that's looking
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
at that
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
box we are we are in the process now of
 
02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.670 align:start position:0%
box we are we are in the process now of
designing

02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
designing
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh different types of boxes to put
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
different types of election materials in
 
02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:56.950 align:start position:0%
different types of election materials in
so

02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know one set of boxes might have
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
cast ballots in it another set of boxes
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
would have absentee voting materials in
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
it another set of boxes might have
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
uncast ballots
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
that were used in the election just to
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
keep things separate we also want to
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we start
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
keeping boxes
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
for each ballot counting device
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
separate and so that they're all all
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
blended together
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
so if we can identify a problem that
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
might be unique to one machine
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we can go to that set of
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
ballots and try and resolve
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think there's a there's a
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
number of tools that we can use number
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
strategies and and we're open to
 
02:30:40.479 --> 02:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
strategies and and we're open to
suggestions

02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh also
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
congratulations secretary scanlan
 
02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
congratulations secretary scanlan
um

02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned earlier that
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
when when you boxes come in for a
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
recount that 80 percent roughly 80
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
percent of the boxes
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
have proper chain of custody procedures
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
whether ceiling or labeling or whatever
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah don't hold me to the eighty percent
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
the point i was trying to make is it you
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
know that there most of the boxes are
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
are properly
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with and it's a direct result of
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the training that we do with local
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
but there are always
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
a percentage of boxes that come in
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
whenever we pick the boxes up and
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a recount we always
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
send our staff out with a state van
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
to go out and pick the boxes up we will
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
number one make sure that the box is
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
secure so that there aren't any loose
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
flaps where things can fall out of or be
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
slipped in
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then once they're secure we put a
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
barcode label on them so that we can
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
identify that box
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
we put it on a log so that when it
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
leaves the clerk's office the clerk
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
signs off on it and then when it's
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
received at the state archives the state
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
archivist or the records manager will
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
sign off that we've actually received
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
those boxes so we have an inventory
 
02:32:12.399 --> 02:32:13.349 align:start position:0%
those boxes so we have an inventory
uh

02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
identified by barcode and then a and
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
then a
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
and then a listing of what the contents
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be in each box
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
um that's the basic process it has
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
worked all these years but i think we
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
can enhance it and and make it more
 
02:32:30.399 --> 02:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
can enhance it and and make it more
secure

02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
secure
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up for another
 
02:32:33.439 --> 02:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up for another
question

02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that clarification i i
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that the eighty percent is
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
sort of an estimate but it it was an
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
estimate that concerns me greatly
 
02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
estimate that concerns me greatly
because

02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
twenty percent
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
not having complete and accurate chain
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
of custody is a lot if it's 10 it's a
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
lot and so i i appreciate
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
some of the procedures you're talking
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
about i commend you for that and uh and
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
the spot checks
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
i think are extremely important and um
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
i have voice to you personally and i'll
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
say this publicly that if there is
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
additional funding needed for the
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office i'm willing
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
to fight for it
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll add my
 
02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:27.270 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll add my
congratulations

02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
congratulations
um

02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
when you said you supported the bill it
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
was with the amendments i just want to
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
make clear that you would that this
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
measure but with the changes that you
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
discussed i don't know
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
that he said he supported the bill okay
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
he did not say that all right so
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
could you correct
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
that for me so that i understand it
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
better yeah i i did not support the bill
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm here to offer information i i think
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
that the subject matter that the bill
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
addresses is something that we need to
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about okay
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification okay
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative pimento
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh thank you
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and congratulations
 
02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.870 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and congratulations
um

02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
simple question what is within
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
your power
 
02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
as secretary of state
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
to make adjustments to the chain of
 
02:34:24.319 --> 02:34:25.429 align:start position:0%
to make adjustments to the chain of
custody

02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
custody
 
02:34:25.439 --> 02:34:26.230 align:start position:0%
custody
and

02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
what would be required from the
 
02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
what would be required from the
legislature

02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
i think any any record-keeping
 
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.150 align:start position:0%
i think any any record-keeping
uh

02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of receiving
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the election materials and
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
delivering them
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
to the archives
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
is something that we can establish
 
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
procedures for
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
for example i i don't think that there's
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
anything that would prevent us
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
after we put the barcodes on them and
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're secure from
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
taking photographs of every box just so
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we have a record of that i mean i
 
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
i think that's something that we could
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
do without legislation um
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think things in the bill about
 
02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:13.910 align:start position:0%
i think things in the bill about
requiring

02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
all boxes to be delivered
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
to the state archives for storage is
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
something that would require
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
legislation right now the statutes
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
only say that we bring boxes to the
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
archives of ballots for when a recount
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
is requested so that we can
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
conduct that recount
 
02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:34.710 align:start position:0%
conduct that recount
otherwise

02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
the ballots and other election materials
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
stay in the clerk's office and they have
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
to store them for the 22 months and then
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
they can destroy them now i'm not aware
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
of any clerks that would be unhappy if
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
we had to give those boxes to the state
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
because it does it does open up space
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee no
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's good thank you very much
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:36:05.439 --> 02:36:06.389 align:start position:0%
any further questions
um

02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i i would like to say to this
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
the secretary that the windham letter
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we referred to
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh made me mindful of the fact that much
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
of what is covered by rules for other
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
departments is in statute
 
02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.710 align:start position:0%
departments is in statute
for

02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
the election duties of the secretary of
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
state's office and i was actually quite
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
 
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:28.710 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
in

02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:30.230 align:start position:0%
in
reading

02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
reading
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that report because
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that it makes it easier to
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
discern on on
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
the conduct of elections as to what is
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
permissible and not additionally it
 
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
permissible and not additionally it
makes

02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
makes
 
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
the changing of things a subject to
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
picture to it
 
02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:56.230 align:start position:0%
picture to it
and

02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
i suspect is easier for you on the other
 
02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
i suspect is easier for you on the other
hand

02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
i have been to the clerk trainings and
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
i don't want to overwhelm
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
the statute procedural piece with what
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
your office needs to be responsive to
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
when you get asked questions at those
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
trainings as to how to handle particular
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
things because our voting
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
areas the 200 plus
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
areas that we have that conduct
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
elections are very different
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
so when you say we need to have a
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
conversation i appreciate that because
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think you want to constrain
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
everything as you said 48 hours for some
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
of these communities to do anything with
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
ballots after election
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
be a vastly different
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
use of resources from one community to
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
the next so
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
up see there you go i the lawyer kept
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking and now we've got more
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but i'll
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
what is what is the level of uniformity
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and control
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
for storage of the ballots once that
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
once they are boxed and sealed
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
it varies widely from community to
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
community it just depends on what type
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
of facilities
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
they have and i can tell you the
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
the uniformity has come a long way
 
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
within the last 20 years
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that was brought on by the
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
help america vote act which required
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know have uniformity
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
with things like the voter
 
02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:41.429 align:start position:0%
with things like the voter
database

02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
prior to that every town or city
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
maintain their own checklist on whatever
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
software program they had available some
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually still had them
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
hand written
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
but you know as you can imagine the
 
02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
city of manchester or nashua probably
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
have vaults
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
where they can
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know put put these documents but you
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
know if you go up to colebrook
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know it might be the you know might
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
be the broom closet that you know the
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
clerk can just turn the key um
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
if they have if they have that and
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the training is that
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
the boxes have to be properly sealed
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
the seals that are placed on the boxes
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
02:39:26.309 --> 02:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
signed by the appropriate election
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
officials and you have to store them
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a secure location
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's left up to the local
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
community on just exactly what that
 
02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
means but you know i think the spot
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
checking idea is one that uh you know
 
02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
might be able to help
 
02:39:44.790 --> 02:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
in that regard in terms of uh
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know we do have vital records in our
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
division and and of course there's a lot
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
more money that is generated through
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
the documents that the clerks have to
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
produce but
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
we were able to take some of that money
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
and give grants
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns
 
02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:04.630 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns
for

02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
for better storage of their vital
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
records information
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
and some of them were able to take that
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and you know design you know appropriate
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
storage you know get things out of the
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
basement and
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
and things like that and maybe something
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
like that as uh you know we're trying
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
with election materials
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up uh
 
02:40:26.399 --> 02:40:27.910 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up uh
you

02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
you implied that
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily think it's a good
 
02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
idea to bring all the ballots to concord
 
02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.710 align:start position:0%
idea to bring all the ballots to concord
uh

02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on that do
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
you think they're better left at the
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
community level or uh would it be better
 
02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:44.230 align:start position:0%
community level or uh would it be better
to

02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
have a state storage facility for all
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
these boxes i think as long as the
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
election materials are stored
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
in a box or container that is
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:00.399 --> 02:41:01.349 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:41:01.349 --> 02:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they have secure storage that
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
that there's no reason why we cannot
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know let the storage be in the
 
02:41:09.439 --> 02:41:10.630 align:start position:0%
you know let the storage be in the
communities

02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:13.429 align:start position:0%
communities
um

02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think they have to be able to show
 
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:15.670 align:start position:0%
i think they have to be able to show
that

02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know that their storage and the way
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're handling those is
 
02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:20.950 align:start position:0%
they're handling those is
uh

02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
is sound insecure for transparency
 
02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
is sound insecure for transparency
um

02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know but i think there's i think
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
there is a way that we can
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%

signed up in support of it 21 persons
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
signed up opposed to it
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we had three persons sign up here in
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
the lob two of them did not speak and
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
they were in favor of the bill
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
that concludes all the input that i have
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%

is hb
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
1522 this is requiring the use of
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
ballots with embedded security and
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
relative to the chain of custody of
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
and we have with us to
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill to committee
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative abrami the prime sponsor
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the record uh state rep pattabrami
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
rockingham 19 stratum
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we we've
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
i've left my testimony on the table
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
and there's another document with some
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
pictures on it that's one of the other
 
03:31:21.190 --> 03:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
speakers also left
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
her her stuff on the table as well
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is about security and and
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
chain of custody of ballots
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
with all the concerns surrounding
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
election integrity this bill suggests
 
03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
some straightforward ways in which all
 
03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
voters can feel even more confident
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
about our election integrity
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
if the state were a bank
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
or other business that relied on utmost
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
security and accuracy of information
 
03:31:50.229 --> 03:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
we as a state would have most likely
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
adopted these types of practices long
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
ago madam chair
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
just a couple of weeks ago actually and
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
published in by abc news this month
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
reaffirms that we already know what we
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
already know
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
that americans faith in the integrity of
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
election system remains shake
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
shaken with only 20 percent of the
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
public saying is very confident about
 
03:32:21.190 --> 03:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
the system
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is a citizen-wide issue
 
03:32:26.790 --> 03:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
irrespective of party
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
70 of democrats 80 of independents and
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
87 percent of republicans
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
do not feel very confident in the
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
election process
 
03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
we need to address
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
that that with some fundamentals
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire plays a very unique role
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the country we are first in the
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
nation and with this responsibility we
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
should be best in class in our election
 
03:32:54.160 --> 03:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
should be best in class in our election
practices

03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
we are bringing forward is to straighten
 
03:33:01.349 --> 03:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
out controls and increase process
 
03:33:01.359 --> 03:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
out controls and increase process
transparency

03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
this will result in improving the
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
integrity of the election process
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
and instilling confidence in our
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
election results
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
to our citizens and country
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
i want to pause here and just say
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
i have no
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
our former secretary of state very well
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
and he's probably the man of the most
 
03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
integrity in this in the state house for
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
so many years
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
and he did a great job all those years
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i think now we're in 2000 and
 
03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're in the 21st century now
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of technology i think we can
 
03:33:38.399 --> 03:33:39.349 align:start position:0%
in terms of technology i think we can
improve

03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
improve
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
upon some of our technology that we're
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
using so the
 
03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
using so the
the

03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill addresses four areas first is
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
the upgrade of ballot technology
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
with the growth of absentee ballots it
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
is imperative we upgrade our ballot
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
technology and make this part of our dna
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
this includes review and recommendation
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
of improvements every five years by the
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
03:34:05.190 --> 03:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
in addition this bill would upgrade our
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
paper ballots to include
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
watermarked paper magnetic inks and
 
03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
other available tools to limit
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
counterfeit ballots
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
second thing it addresses it's the
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
tightening of the business controls
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
we should centralize design and supply
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
selection of ballot printing with the
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state nag
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
we should strictly manage the number of
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
ballots issued and unissued by with
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
towns ballots should
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
be reconciled before and after the
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
election with every ballot accounted for
 
03:34:37.439 --> 03:34:38.389 align:start position:0%
election with every ballot accounted for
we

03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
we should use separation of duties with
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
towns managing the ordering and storage
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
of ballots
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and envelopes while the the secretary of
 
03:34:49.349 --> 03:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
state manages the supplier and the
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
and the recounts
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
that do not meet the residency or
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
identification requirements of rsa 657
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
colon 7
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
roman 2
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
will have a time to cure
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
the voter will be notified by the clerk
 
03:35:10.469 --> 03:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
of deficiencies
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
the voter will have up to the close of
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
the polls to cure
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
03:35:16.239 --> 03:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
after the election
or

03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that that was rejected and then if if
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
not cured the vote would have to be
 
03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:24.870 align:start position:0%
not cured the vote would have to be
rejected

03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
rejected
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
the third major area is increased ballot
 
03:35:27.359 --> 03:35:29.190 align:start position:0%
the third major area is increased ballot
security

03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
security
 
03:35:31.590 --> 03:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
ballots should be stored in locked
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
encrypted storage
 
03:35:36.150 --> 03:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
areas with access controls implemented
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
including video surveillance and and
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
access logs
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the final issue uh is transparency
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
we should allow the public viewing of
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
digital copies of the ballots uh
 
03:35:47.359 --> 03:35:48.550 align:start position:0%
digital copies of the ballots uh
processed

03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
processed
 
03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
to enable citizen audit within eight
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
hours of of uh the close of the polls
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the committee will review each
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
component of this bill and support the
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
whole or pieces that
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh you deem the most feasible to adopt
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
the work on this bill was researched by
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
a group led by brenda towne who was here
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%

a business here in new hampshire i was

raised a passion in me and election has
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
become that passion and as pat
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative obrami said to you guys i
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
started working with a large group of
 
03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
citizens to do a citizen's audit
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
on the state after the uh 2020 election
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to see how we were
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
doing and so as part of that effort
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've got about 7 000
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
folks who follow us on multiple
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
platforms in social media and contribute
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
to the work that we are doing to perform
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the audit we've done about 243 foia
 
03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:21.349 align:start position:0%
the audit we've done about 243 foia
requests

03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
requests
 
03:38:23.349 --> 03:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
in order to gather information we have
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
the machine tapes on pretty much every
 
03:38:27.510 --> 03:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
town and we've done a lot of work with
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
on pulling their information and helping
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
them understand the information
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what i really wanted to say is that
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
i want the clerks and the townsfolks to
 
03:38:39.670 --> 03:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
know that we appreciate everything that
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
they do
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
in no way it coming to check a process
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
are we saying that there's something
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
that anyone's doing wrong instead
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
the more work we do the more we really
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the level of effort and
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
integrity that the teams have and so we
 
03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward because we
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
really believe process improvement
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
which is what we do in manufacturing
 
03:39:03.269 --> 03:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
would really help our town team and one
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
of those areas of process improvement is
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
segregation of responsibilities and
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
improving the security of things
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to just talk to you a little
 
03:39:15.269 --> 03:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
bit about our responsibility of making
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
sure that our election um our votes and
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
ballots are treated like cash i think we
 
03:39:21.910 --> 03:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
would all appreciate having that level
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
of rigor and also the importance of us
 
03:39:25.990 --> 03:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
being first in the nation we have a lot
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
of people watching what we do and we set
 
03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
the tone for the rest of the elections
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
rolling through so we take that real
 
03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:33.429 align:start position:0%
rolling through so we take that real
seriously

03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
so what we found through our process is
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
that we have ballots that are printed by
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
our towns
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
and are managed by our towns
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
i actually personally printed my son's
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
military ballot and mailed it to him at
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
camp lejeune and had him mail it in and
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
so through the process what we found is
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
that the printing of ballots is really
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
inconsistent across our state different
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
papers different ways of accessing the
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
ballots um people are using the town
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
printers or even going to staples so
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
from an integrity standpoint we really
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't have one standard on how we print
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
those ballots as well as we have no way
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
as a state to recognize whether all the
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
ballots went out were all the ones that
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
came back in we can't reconcile that and
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
if that was your bank account you'd be a
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
little bit nervous that um they couldn't
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
tell you where the money went and so we
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
were asking on this bill to increase the
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
security of the ballots themselves as
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
well as the process in which we manage
 
03:40:28.560 --> 03:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
well as the process in which we manage
them

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
we're also looking for
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
increased security on the storage of
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
those ballots and included on the
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
handout that i gave you are pictures of
 
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
the ballots that were splashed all over
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
the news when the wyndham um town was
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
audited and you'll notice there's just
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
giant gaps and plastic in um
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
in paper boxes in tape has been sealed
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
and unsealed and
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
and so from an overall security
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint we really are lacking in that
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
space and we owe it to the citizens of
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to treat their ballots as
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
though they had just done a deposit in
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bank so if anything ever needs an
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
audit we have that source material
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to talk to you a little bit
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
about canvassing and what we found in
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
canvassing so i led the canvassing
 
03:41:11.279 --> 03:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
canvassing so i led the canvassing
efforts

03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and again some high-level stats are
 
03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
there we haven't completed our work
 
03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
we're almost done but i wanted to show
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
the committee that these are all signed
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits from people who have gone out
 
03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
affidavits from people who have gone out
to

03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
canvas our towns and what we've found on
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
average of the people who answered the
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
door 15
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
of those folks didn't actually cast the
 
03:41:32.880 --> 03:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
of those folks didn't actually cast the
ballot

03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
so it's there's a gap and so what we're
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to do is to help us
 
03:41:41.349 --> 03:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
in this one area to close the gap on
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
ballot security and that involves both
 
03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
the as i said the printing of them and
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
giving them out to our citizens as well
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
as the way that we store them when we
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
get them back
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
the last part of this bill that is
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
really urgent is the transparency aspect
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
from somebody who went and helped the
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
team do the citizens audit
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
what we found is disconnects in a lot of
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
the data that we collected what was on
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's database was
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
not the same thing that the towns had
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we had no visibility
 
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
into the ballots to triangulate all that
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
stuff and i know that there was a huge
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
turnout last week of people concerned
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
truly concerned about our voting
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
machines and to provide this
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
transparency of all of the ballots that
 
03:42:25.110 --> 03:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
were processed
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
that would enable a citizen to complete
 
03:42:29.910 --> 03:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
this audit and would
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
allow us to have a level of confidence
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the whole process could be tightly
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
managed i'm sure there are more things
 
03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
to address but i looked at this as an
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to set some of the macro
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
level business controls in place and to
 
03:42:44.309 --> 03:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
create a corrective action and
 
03:42:46.150 --> 03:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
continuous improvement process which is
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
what we do in manufacturing so thank you
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
very much and if you have any questions
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to answer them for you thank
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony questions
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:42:57.199 --> 03:43:05.670 align:start position:0%
from the committee
representative

03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
hit groin right button thank you
 
03:43:07.680 --> 03:43:09.189 align:start position:0%
hit groin right button thank you
um

03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:09.199 --> 03:43:09.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
one of the changes in here is
 
03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
one of the changes in here is
um

03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:15.990 --> 03:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
to have the it
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
previously it said ballots uh shall be
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
prepared and delivered by the secretary
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
of state now it says ordered by
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
political subdivision from deployer
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
supplier determined by the secretary of
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
state why that change
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
so what we were trying to do is again
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
separation of duties so the secretary of
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
state would have the responsibility of
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the design and the selection
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the supplier in the ballots
 
03:43:42.309 --> 03:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
the towns would then be responsible for
 
03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
ordering their total quantity and being
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
able to measure the amount of ballots in
 
03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
amount of ballots used amount of ballots
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
left over and the supplier would act as
 
03:43:53.750 --> 03:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
kind of that pivot point in the middle
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh managing the overall flow of ballots
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
so that they could provide that
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of who got what ballot
 
03:44:02.710 --> 03:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so again keeping it at the source
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
was the idea
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up so
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
would would the ballots be
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
individually identified by some bar code
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
or would it just be by number of ballots
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
that each
 
03:44:17.920 --> 03:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
that each
voting

03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
voting
 
03:44:18.960 --> 03:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
voting
area

03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:21.189 align:start position:0%
area
received

03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
received
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
so there's two ways right the design
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
which would be up to the secretary of
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
state and a.g to create
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
could have some kind of qr code which
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
some other states are recommending to
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
allow the voter to watch their vote go
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
in this we left it open so that the
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state could determine if we
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
would use pure ballot count as our
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
message our method to reconcile or
 
03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
whether there would be more complex
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
technology introduced into these ballots
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
at this point in time a step a major
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
step forward would be the total
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of ballots where they
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
went and where they remain
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of an election
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.070 --> 03:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.080 --> 03:45:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you man for
 
03:45:12.309 --> 03:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
has this been used in any other state or
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
has this been or in a business uh format
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
in other words is this technology been
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
been tried and tested yet
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
um it's being introduced in arizona as
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
we speak and i don't know if there are
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
other states that are using it today i
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
know that other states do use a
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
different methodology to trace their
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
ballots so that they do know how many
 
03:45:36.150 --> 03:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
have been sent out and how many they've
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
gotten returned but that's a gap in our
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
process so it would be something that as
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
a state this methodology
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
would help us to close and it would also
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
help us with the authenticity of the
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and um what would you envision
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
the time frame would be to
 
03:45:56.479 --> 03:45:57.590 align:start position:0%
the time frame would be to
if

03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
we wanted to go down this path to
 
03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:01.110 align:start position:0%
we wanted to go down this path to
implement

03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
implement
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
the change over for all the items listed
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
well i would anticipate that this would
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
take probably a year for the
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
process to be validated and then there's
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be some level of
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
design for those ballots and then
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
training for our teams so that they feel
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
confident in the process so i'd give it
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
from the date it said okay if and that's
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
if from the business world i don't know
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative world i know that in my
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
world we'd i'd give them three months
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:38.150 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things you said in your
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony is that
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are ordering ballots
 
03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
from all different vendors and coming up
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
in different types of paper
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
state elections the ballots are prepared
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of the secretary
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
of state from a local printer with
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
oversight provided by the secretary of
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
state can you explain why it would be
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
more efficient to now have more than 200
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
cities and towns dealing with a single
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
vendor instead of one office dealing
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
with a single vendor well i believe that
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
this gives the flexibility to the towns
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
to manage the total count of votes
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
and what i've seen in the
 
03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
and what i've seen in the
election

03:47:16.150 --> 03:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
audit that we've done is that towns
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
would order their ballots from that
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
location and then they would go out if
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
they were short and print them on their
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
printers within their own town halls or
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
run down to staples and that just
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
happened in greenland a couple weeks ago
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it was very public
 
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
follow up um again i
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're talking about town
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
elections but i'll move on to another
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
question okay um
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
all ballots received shall after
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
inspection be stored in locked boxes and
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
encrypted there's a cost associated with
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
that who's going to pay for it the
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
constitution says that the legislature
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
can't uh pass unfunded mandates and so
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to cost who's going
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
to pay for it where's the funds going to
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
come from
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
well that's why we're going to go to the
 
03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee to do an assessment of
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the costs and at this point in time um
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
talking to pat abrami we're assuming
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
that there would be a fund created to
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
relieve the costs to the towns from the
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
state level okay no further questions
 
03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
state level okay no further questions
manager

03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
manager
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
further questions from the community i
 
03:48:22.630 --> 03:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
had one more comment um
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
in in total
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that the angst in the number
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
of foia requests that are being launched
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
against our towns
 
03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
has grown because of this concern over
 
03:48:35.110 --> 03:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
business controls so
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
when i assess kind of the overall cost
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of this bill
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
there may be cost increases in one area
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
but i i believe that there will be
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
reductions in other areas and as you can
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
see demonstrated in the pictures of the
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
windham audit and the conditions of the
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
security that were used to store those
 
03:48:54.150 --> 03:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
ballots i think that the folks here in
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would be very anxious and
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
willing to fund the improvement thank
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
the the last item on you the electronic
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
and it you're adding to have a
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
digital scan
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh made
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
do you have more
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
you have thoughts on that as to how
 
03:49:26.469 --> 03:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
would that be accomplished is that to be
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
done centrally or to be done by the city
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
and down or how would that be done it
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
could be done very simply with the town
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
a simple scanner along with a connection
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
to a storage device would be able to
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
house those images and at the end of an
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
election it could be uploaded to the
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
town website
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
you would just need the capability of a
 
03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
high speed scanner
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:56.080 align:start position:0%

03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm drawing it blank i have a blank
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative ward go ahead
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i
 
03:50:11.590 --> 03:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
just had a question about your
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh canvassing preliminary findings you
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
went through that kind of quickly and i
 
03:50:16.150 --> 03:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can can you get a little
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic we're just having to
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
explain the canvassing procedure you did
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and what that you think that actually
 
03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:22.469 align:start position:0%
and what that you think that actually
meant

03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
meant
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
so um the canvassing
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to say that anybody who
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
went canvassing my hats off to them
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
because nobody
 
03:50:31.030 --> 03:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
all the introverts in the world ran in
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
the other direction when we sent out a
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
request but what the canvassing was like
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
is we took the actual town
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
checklists from the day of the election
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
and we created walk lists to make it
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
easier to find folks who voted in
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and then we would go knock
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
on a door and ask them the people at the
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
home hey um are you judy smith and have
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
them confirm who they were um and then
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
we would ask if they voted in the
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
election if there were other folks in
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
their household that voted and
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
if there were other voters they might
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
come and participate in the canvas or
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
judy might answer for her spouse but we
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
went door-to-door to door-to-door and we
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
did almost
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
900 houses so far and i haven't gotten
 
03:51:18.790 --> 03:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i missed some of your
 
03:51:25.439 --> 03:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i missed some of your
testimony

03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:51:26.960 --> 03:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
testimony
but

03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
are you talking about people that voted
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
absentee and then you found that 15 of
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
them did not return their absentee
 
03:51:35.680 --> 03:51:36.790 align:start position:0%
them did not return their absentee
ballot

03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
um no there's
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds of different scenarios that
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
were we're doing the analysis on but
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen is i'd knock on a door
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the person hey um is
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
marge you know smith here and
 
03:51:53.189 --> 03:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
she'd say that's me and i said i would
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
ask her did you vote in the 2020
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
election we're just doing a canvas and
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
she would say no i didn't vote in the
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
election but then town checklist said
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
that marge smith voted absentee and that
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be one of the items that we would
 
03:52:12.150 --> 03:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:18.389 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious um
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
when you said you hit 900 homes over the
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
course of the state i mean it's a huge
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
amount did you target a certain
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
community in particular and if so why
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
we actually we used two smaller towns
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
because we thought that we would be able
 
03:52:34.479 --> 03:52:35.189 align:start position:0%
because we thought that we would be able
to

03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
get a better sense of the overall town
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we targeted um two towns that had
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
a higher
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
level of turnout relative to their
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
overall registration because we felt
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe there was something that was
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
a little unusual in those towns and so
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
we started there with the vast
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh state and a small team we just had to
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
pick our bets and choose two towns that
 
03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
we thought we would be able to see if
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
all set for the question
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
so i am a little confused here um
 
03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
so i am a little confused here um
because

03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
if if i'm hearing you correctly it's
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh we have a problem
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
you would go to the door you would talk
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
to them they would say i didn't vote in
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
the election and then they would sign
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
the affidavit the piece of paper um
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's a you weren't here for my
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit speech but uh they would sign
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
the piece of paper
 
03:53:32.800 --> 03:53:33.510 align:start position:0%
the piece of paper
and

03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
saying i did not vote in the election
 
03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that's what you have with you today
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
no i have the canvassers
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
affidavits who are testifying to they
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
went to that person's door and what the
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
person said to them i have the name of
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
the voter their address how the record
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
said that they voted in what the voter
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
told us so those are all contained in
 
03:53:54.870 --> 03:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
the affidavits and i'm sorry ma'am
 
03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%

03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
that list to the committee the secretary
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%

justice yes we will we're just as i said
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the timing of all of these
 
03:54:04.720 --> 03:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the timing of all of these
things

03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
and trying to close on it but i will be
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
providing all of that and uh and provide
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
the analysis that s at the top level as
 
03:54:12.319 --> 03:54:15.429 align:start position:0%
the analysis that s at the top level as
well

03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:54:23.520 --> 03:54:24.469 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
um

03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:26.229 --> 03:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on representative
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
bergeron's question because i'm still
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
confused on
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
how having the towns and the cities
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
print the ballots
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
make it it doesn't seem to me that it's
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
adding that much more control or i mean
 
03:54:43.990 --> 03:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
why isn't it but
 
03:54:46.150 --> 03:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
or why is there a problem with the way
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's done now
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
so um today what we're seeing is that
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
towns can augment their um ballots by
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
supplementing them with additional
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
prints of ballots and there's a lack of
 
03:54:59.199 --> 03:55:00.469 align:start position:0%
prints of ballots and there's a lack of
consistency

03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
on the overall
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
ballot construction the paper the ink
 
03:55:06.630 --> 03:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
the format where they came from and the
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
total number
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is say look
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've found this supplier supplier x who
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be the sole source for all
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
of our ballots
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know uh manchester will order all
 
03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
their ballots from that supplier and
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
then those ballots will come directly to
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
manchester in manchester will manage
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
their ballots
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
that supplier will then have visibility
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
in how
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
the total number of ballots that were
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
issued across the state of new hampshire
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
so we have data point one
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
then we have the data point of
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
manchester and then all the other towns
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
how many times how many ballots did they
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
issue absentee how many ballots did they
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
use the day of the election for
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
in-person voting and how many were not
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
used at the end of this process we can
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
tie all of the numbers together to see
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
how many total ballots were used in all
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
of those capacities and whether they tie
 
03:56:01.349 --> 03:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
out to what that supplier issued and so
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is just
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
triangulate the control so that we know
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
that there aren't any um access ballots
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
out into the
 
03:56:12.389 --> 03:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
citizens re to people that may not or
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
should not be voting in our elections
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
that process makes sense i guess what i
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't what i'm missing and maybe this is
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
my own lack of knowledge is how is it
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
done now from the secretary of state
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
do they
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
just ship them to manchester or
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
just me so maybe that's what i'm missing
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know how it's done now and where
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's a a gap
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you know for
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that the gap
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
today is that not only do they get the
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
ballots from the secretary of state but
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
they are also supplementing with
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
additional ballots should they need them
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
in order to conduct their elections all
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
right i need a little specificity in
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
terminology because when you use the
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
term there and for those of us who are
 
03:56:55.269 --> 03:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the procedure there are
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
specific parties involved in this
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
process who do this the secretary of
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
state is not supplementing ballots on a
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
local level that is something handled by
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
local officials under a procedure that
 
03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
is governed under
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh processes that they receive training
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
from from the secretary of state
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair actually you kind
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
of addressed the point i was going to
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
make the only times or did you know that
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
the only times that cities or towns are
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
authorized under state law to print
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
additional ballots is when they run out
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the ballots provided by the secretary
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
of state's office for state elections
 
03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that that there are
 
03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
very high standards for them to meet and
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's very very rare that this ever
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
occurs you're making it sound like this
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
happens all the time in all the cities
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
and towns and that's just not true
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't want it and i apologize that
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't a question all right i don't want
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
to cast dispersions on anyone i'll just
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
tell you from my personal experience
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
that at for the last presidential
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
election i printed on my home printer
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
so for the last presidential election
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the absentee ballot
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
process is that correct yes and did you
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually print a ballot or did you print
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot request i printed the
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
ballot okay
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
and were those processes established as
 
03:58:10.870 --> 03:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
a one-time procedure for that election
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you know i have no idea i just again
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
as somebody who's collecting all of the
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
moving parts and trying to see if we
 
03:58:20.710 --> 03:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
could put some more business controls in
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
place to that that was a reaction to
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman thank you
 
03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:30.550 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman thank you
and

03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:30.560 --> 03:58:32.309 align:start position:0%
and
your

03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:58:34.150 --> 03:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
answer earlier
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
i have trouble making this a question
 
03:58:36.319 --> 03:58:37.189 align:start position:0%
i have trouble making this a question
um

03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
the military ballots
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
that their
 
03:58:41.040 --> 03:58:42.229 align:start position:0%
that their
procedure

03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
is you get an email
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
you print
 
03:58:49.990 --> 03:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
the pdf from the email you fill that out
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
and mail it in
 
03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's a yukaba ballot and i understood
 
03:58:55.990 --> 03:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
her to just say that was an absentee
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
ballot so can we have some clarification
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
was it it was a ballot or an absentee it
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
was a military ballot okay so there are
 
03:59:03.429 --> 03:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
completely different federal rules
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
governing you cava ballots continue
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
 
03:59:08.560 --> 03:59:09.910 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
procedurally

03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
procedurally
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have watermarked
 
03:59:12.319 --> 03:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have watermarked
ballots

03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
how would that work
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
it would be my understanding that we
 
03:59:19.120 --> 03:59:19.910 align:start position:0%
it would be my understanding that we
would

03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
send ballots to locations where our
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
personnel are in order to provide them
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
or in the case of military ballots if
 
03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's an impossibility that we would
 
03:59:28.880 --> 03:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
that's an impossibility that we would
make

03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
a process for them to be able to
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
participate in the vote
 
03:59:36.150 --> 03:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
for those people
 
03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
listening who don't know what a youkava
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
ballot is that's a special provision
 
03:59:40.000 --> 03:59:40.870 align:start position:0%
ballot is that's a special provision
under

03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
a federal statute to allow deployed
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
military personnel to participate in an
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
election and there are actually
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
separate as you've just heard separate
 
03:59:54.150 --> 03:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
procedures and actually certain
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
deadlines that need to be met
 
03:59:57.429 --> 03:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
in order
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that deployed military service
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
people can receive a ballot in time for
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
it to be counted in the election just
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
for clarification
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
my question is related to
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
either one the town didn't order enough
 
04:00:24.000 --> 04:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
either one the town didn't order enough
ballots

04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
or maybe they ordered them too late
 
04:00:30.150 --> 04:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
how would that be dealt with
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
for the voters of that town
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
well i
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
again as a practice
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
we would probably in tell our towns to
 
04:00:42.150 --> 04:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
order over what they would anticipate
 
04:00:44.309 --> 04:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
for voters to in order to be able to
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
accommodate with the idea being that
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
they would have leftovers in in every
 
04:00:48.840 --> 04:00:50.710 align:start position:0%
they would have leftovers in in every
condition

04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know the best method if they ran
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
out in my world of manufacturing we call
 
04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
that safety stock and we would hold
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
extra in reserve in anticipation that
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
there was more of a turnout than we had
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.229 --> 04:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up question can you please get
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic we've gotten a comment
 
04:01:13.590 --> 04:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
that people are not getting picked up
 
04:01:13.600 --> 04:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
that people are not getting picked up
um

04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:14.640 --> 04:01:16.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:19.510 --> 04:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
if that all goes wrong
 
04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
and a particular town doesn't have
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
more ballots
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i mean we have people who want to vote
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want to disenfranchise them
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
what would be the procedure
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
for the town to get more ballots
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
i would i would if i were trying to
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
solution it on the day of i would be
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
finding out if other towns had excess
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
ballots that could be used in my town
 
04:01:53.830 --> 04:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
ballot in my time elections that's what
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
i would do
 
04:01:55.520 --> 04:01:56.469 align:start position:0%
i would do
if

04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was a shortage but again i would
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
also create a process where there was a
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
safety stock and reserve level
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
that each town would hold in
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
anticipation of
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
an increase in turnout from their
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
historical performance
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way that we handle it in my
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
all set
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from members of the
 
04:02:19.600 --> 04:02:22.950 align:start position:0%
further questions from members of the
committee

04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you for coming
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much and i really
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i wish i had every answer
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the planet i don't i'm only just a
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
passionate citizen who
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
is hoping for some help thank you
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you hearing my testimony
 
04:02:53.600 --> 04:02:54.550 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you hearing my testimony
today

04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm asking that you support hb 1522 this
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
bill requires that elections in new
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire be conducted oh i'm sorry for
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
the record representative judy aaron i
 
04:03:13.510 --> 04:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.269 --> 04:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
so this bill requires that elections in
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire be conducted using ballots
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
with embedded security and specifies
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
security upgrades for ballot chain of
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
custody during and after an election
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
this bill also requires validation of
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
the eligibility of absentee ballot
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
voters this bill improves layers of
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
security for our elections which is a
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
positive step in maintaining trust in
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the election process
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
embedded security placed in our printed
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
ballots maintains the integrity of the
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
voting process by ensuring that only
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
authentic ballots are used during an
 
04:03:47.279 --> 04:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
authentic ballots are used during an
election

04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
embedded security features can prevent
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
the unauthorized generation printing
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
duplication or counterfeiting of ballots
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
for use in an election and therefore can
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
prevent counterfeit ballots from being
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
counted as valid ballots
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
just like we embed our money with
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
watermarks and other measures to ensure
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
validity and authenticity we should do
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
the same with our election ballots
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
if we have this technology available
 
04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
then why would we not employ it to
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
ensure election integrity
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
ballot security features could include
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
but are not limited to technology such
 
04:04:25.510 --> 04:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
as ultraviolet features infrared
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
features magnetic features
 
04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
fluorescence features
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
visual ink features and watermarks
 
04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
the implementation of such features in
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
paper stock used to print official
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
ballots can also include but is not
 
04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
limited to shapes words numbers images
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
barcodes codes and barcodes that can
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
include any one of real data and
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
encrypted real data
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
for example if the embedded feature is
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
magnetic such as an embedded metallic
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
layer the embedded metallic material can
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
have a particular shape
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
including the shape of a number a letter
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
or a word or be in the form of a bar
 
04:05:04.000 --> 04:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
or a word or be in the form of a bar
code

04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the ballot reader or machine tabulator
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
can read or sense the embedded security
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
feature while tabulating the choices
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
marked on the ballot and if the ballot
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
is not authentic then the ballot would
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
be rejected
 
04:05:17.040 --> 04:05:18.790 align:start position:0%
be rejected
secondly

04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to ballot chain of custody
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
all ballots should be kept in
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
receptacles which have tamper-proof
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
seals and stored in secured places with
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
video monitoring
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
no on
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
unauthorized person should ever have
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
access to our election ballots while
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
they are being stored
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
currently i've seen that our ballots are
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
kept in taped up boxes
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
tape is not secure it can be ripped off
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
and replaced
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
we need more security in our chain of
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
custody for our elections the bill
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
addresses those security failings
 
04:05:54.319 --> 04:05:55.349 align:start position:0%
addresses those security failings
lastly

04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
anyone voting with an absentee ballot
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be thoroughly vetted and we
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
must make sure they are valid new
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters meeting residency and
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
identification requirements
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill ensures that votes of absentee
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
ballots are not only counted if proper
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
are only counted if proper id
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are met
 
04:06:16.150 --> 04:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's just common sense
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
no one should be able to vote if they
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
are not legal and eligible voters in new
 
04:06:20.319 --> 04:06:21.429 align:start position:0%
are not legal and eligible voters in new
hampshire

04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
our requirements to vote must be
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
respected and adhered to
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise why have election laws at all
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
one may say this would be a big expense
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
to municipalities to implement these
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of changes
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think the assurance of a valid
 
04:06:40.150 --> 04:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
election is totally worth the price
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
our constituents are demanding election
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
and cure integrity loudly
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
and clearly
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we should listen to them
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill makes our voting system more
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
secure and tamper-proof
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that is why we should be pursuing
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
so i ask you to please pass this bill
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
out of your committee with an otp
 
04:07:01.120 --> 04:07:02.550 align:start position:0%
out of your committee with an otp
recommendation

04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me today
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming representative
 
04:07:06.880 --> 04:07:09.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming representative

representative terozian
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative aaron for taking the
 
04:07:16.960 --> 04:07:18.469 align:start position:0%
representative aaron for taking the
question

04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming and
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
let me know if i'm wrong in order to
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
implement this technology
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh all the towns would have to have a
 
04:07:28.880 --> 04:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
uh all the towns would have to have a
new

04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
vote counting machines in order to read
 
04:07:32.000 --> 04:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
vote counting machines in order to read
the

04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
um security measures the whether it be
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
watermark or embedded uh type security
 
04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
would that would that be true
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
possibly depending on what kind of
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
technology is chosen to be on these
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
ballots um
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
it could be that
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
maybe before they're scanned they're you
 
04:07:49.920 --> 04:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
maybe before they're scanned they're you
know

04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
put into some other sort of machine to
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
validate them before they're read so um
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know could be that
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
rather than replacing the entire scanner
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
you just get some other piece of
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
equipment that would validate the ballot
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up question would um
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
so would that
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
mean that towns that currently use paper
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
ballots would probably have to go to a
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i think that that's you
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
know part of the processes that would
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
have to be worked out
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
through the through the process of
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
after the bill was passed
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative i have a couple questions
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
and it might have been more appropriate
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
for representative abrami but i knew he
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
had to leave so
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to ask you you mentioned
 
04:08:43.349 --> 04:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the absentee ballot process
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill and i was a little
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
surprised to see it because the purpose
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
was clearly to do with security and and
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
sort of chain of custody and then we had
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
this absentee ballot provision sort of
 
04:08:55.110 --> 04:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
put into it on page four
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
so my uh
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe do you know when
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot envelopes are opened
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
under law now for elections
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
and when is that that's
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
when the
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
either what that usually they there's a
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
day before
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's pre-processing and that was a
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
special process that was for the
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
elections of 2020 only
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
so currently there are no pre-processing
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
provisions in law
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
so do you know
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
when under current law
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are opened in the
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
election i'm not aware
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay would you believe that is the day
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
of election okay all right and i'm i'm
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
keeping a look at my secretary of state
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
bobbing heads and representative
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
bergeron to make sure i've got this
 
04:09:44.720 --> 04:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
bergeron to make sure i've got this
right

04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
um we really should sort of make bobble
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
head dogs and
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that would be pretty good if you if
 
04:09:53.110 --> 04:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
you weren't a bobblehead
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
doll in election law that means you've
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
made it all right
 
04:09:57.279 --> 04:09:58.149 align:start position:0%
made it all right
so

04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
the so the envelopes are actually not
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
opened until the day of the election so
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the processing of the absentee ballots
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
can occur on election day and there are
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
provisions in regards to letting people
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
watch the process and checking them in
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the checklist on the day of
 
04:10:12.960 --> 04:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
through the checklist on the day of
election

04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:10:14.000 --> 04:10:15.269 align:start position:0%
election
so

04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
i understand this bill and and
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
i think maybe i'm asking this question
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
for you to relay to representative
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
abrami maybe to get back to me sure um
 
04:10:26.950 --> 04:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
this bill then would provide that the
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
moderator opens the envelope on the day
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
of the election
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that's when the verification process
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
begins at least as to whether this is an
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate voter who has returned a
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
requested absentee ballot
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
and then and on i'm again i'm on page
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
four the bill
 
04:10:43.840 --> 04:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
four the bill
um

04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
section 13 and paragraph two
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
um it relates to with the documentation
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
for proof of identity is not sufficient
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
there is going to be an opportunity to
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
essentially cure right by notifying the
 
04:11:01.040 --> 04:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
essentially cure right by notifying the
voter

04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
voter
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
and letting the voter
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
bring whatever is needed down by the end
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the day so that their absentee ballot
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
can be
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
can be marked
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
is that what you understand this
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
provision to me yes well they have up
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
until the close of the polls on that day
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
right so the envelope is being opened in
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if the deficiency is discovered they
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
have until the close of the polls that
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
day to correct it under the this version
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
yes but i would also assume that
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
when from the time that the person
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
submits their absentee ballot to
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the town
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh and the time of the election
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a time there that you can
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
bring your information to the town clerk
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
to have everything verified ahead of
 
04:11:49.439 --> 04:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
to have everything verified ahead of
time

04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's actually not the absentee ballot
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
process okay i just wanted to clarify
 
04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
because i think what this says is
 
04:11:58.720 --> 04:11:59.830 align:start position:0%
because i think what this says is
that

04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
your envelope is opened the receipt of
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot is recorded and as
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
long as the clerks are keeping up with
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the system the absentee voter can
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually go on
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
line and and see that their absentee
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
ballot has been received but that ballot
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
is not processed until the day of the
 
04:12:19.439 --> 04:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
is not processed until the day of the
election

04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
so on the day of the election the outer
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
envelope would be opened
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then the verification process with
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
the match to the request and the
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
checklist would be done
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
and if there was a deficiency under this
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill what would happen is there would be
 
04:12:35.520 --> 04:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
bill what would happen is there would be
a

04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:38.870 align:start position:0%
a
requirement

04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:12:40.710 --> 04:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
because it says the moderator shall
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
contact the voter in an attempt to to
 
04:12:43.760 --> 04:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
contact the voter in an attempt to to
cure

04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
cure
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the deficiency
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
did you ask any did the sponsors of the
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill inquire of anybody at the ag's
 
04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
office as to whether they felt such a
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
quick turnaround for a deficiency cure
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
would be legally acceptable
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
and two
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the moderator
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
cannot contact the voter because
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes people are absent because
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
they're absentee voters so you're not
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
able to reach them right um
 
04:13:19.680 --> 04:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
able to reach them right um
so

04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:20.800 --> 04:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i've apologized for
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
posturing those questions to you but
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps um well yes somebody else
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
speaking can address it or
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative abrami can get back to us
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's something i i would uh defer to
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative abrami i don't know if he
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
had something in mind in particular to
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
address that
 
04:13:44.720 --> 04:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
address that
but

04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay it was my thought
 
04:13:48.080 --> 04:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
okay it was my thought
that

04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
between the time that a person submits
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot whether it's
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
opened or not
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
that they can then provide
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh documentation necessary to prove that
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
they are a legal you know legal and
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
eligible voter okay thank you
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
and again this may not be appropriate
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's a question about
 
04:14:25.110 --> 04:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
section 14 about the electronic ballot
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
um i guess my my question is
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
one well i have two questions so
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
bruce go ahead
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
i have that provision circled also okay
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
one is uh to provide within eight hours
 
04:14:44.790 --> 04:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
is that did anybody talk and then the
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
term is used citizen's audit could you
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
explain and it's in quotes and not
 
04:14:49.760 --> 04:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
explain and it's in quotes and not
defined

04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
so could you
 
04:14:55.110 --> 04:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
explain what a citizen's audit is and is
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
eight hours enough time for it to be
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.920 --> 04:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
citizens should be able to
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
see whether or not
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know what what the counts of the
 
04:15:11.040 --> 04:15:12.710 align:start position:0%
you know what what the counts of the
ballots

04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
were after the election i would imagine
 
04:15:15.680 --> 04:15:16.630 align:start position:0%
were after the election i would imagine
that

04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
the information should be made available
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
if they if they can um
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the answers we maybe
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
you can convey this so yeah those issues
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
i would imagine
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
that representative romney probably had
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
um you know more insight into what he
 
04:15:36.870 --> 04:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
was seeking for that
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean sure if you'll have
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
thanks does anybody have any questions
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
i just have a question on page four
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
if the moderator finds the absentee
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
voter has not included the photocopied
 
04:15:59.040 --> 04:16:03.349 align:start position:0%
voter has not included the photocopied
documentation

04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
so we have to make a photocopy
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
of your documentations when you sign
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:16:13.110 --> 04:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
send that in to show where you
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
live your id your id and everything
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
usually with the absentee ballots
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
they're for people that are not able to
 
04:16:23.110 --> 04:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
come out
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
04:16:24.319 --> 04:16:25.830 align:start position:0%
a lot
and

04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
i think it would be hard a hardship on
 
04:16:28.319 --> 04:16:29.269 align:start position:0%
i think it would be hard a hardship on
them

04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
to have a photocopy of these
 
04:16:31.199 --> 04:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
to have a photocopy of these
documentations

04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
documentations
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
do you agree
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't know you know what
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
people's situations are but certainly
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of people have
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
photocopiers at home and well and even
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't they're available in many
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
different places so i don't know i think
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an unreasonable ask
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you thank you i
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%

04:17:02.960 --> 04:17:03.750 align:start position:0%
appreciate it

04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%

04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state david scanlon as
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%

04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%

04:17:35.040 --> 04:17:36.309 align:start position:0%
committee i'm david scanlon secretary of
state

04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
appearing today in opposition to the
 
04:17:38.000 --> 04:17:38.790 align:start position:0%
appearing today in opposition to the
bill

04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
but before i go into the reasons why
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to just piggyback on my
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
prior testimony
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying that this type of
 
04:17:47.040 --> 04:17:48.710 align:start position:0%
saying that this type of
legislation

04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:17:48.720 --> 04:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
legislation
is

04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the result of a decline in voter
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
confidence in our elections
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we do need to take steps to correct
 
04:17:57.120 --> 04:17:58.389 align:start position:0%
and we do need to take steps to correct
that

04:17:58.389 --> 04:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
portions in this bill that talk about
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
of ballots
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
watermarks or synthetic dna or things
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
like that i think that should all be
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it helps improve that confidence and
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly willing to work with the
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee or others on what that might
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
look like
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
the primary reason that i pose the bill
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
is because it decentralizes who's
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for conducting the election
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
and right now the buck stops with the
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the secretary of
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
state is chosen by the legislature every
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
two years and if that person doesn't do
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
a good job
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
then you know they're they're free to
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
choose somebody else
 
04:18:45.680 --> 04:18:46.830 align:start position:0%
choose somebody else
who

04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
can if you remove
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's responsibility
 
04:18:52.399 --> 04:18:53.349 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's responsibility
for

04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh preparing the ballots and
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
distributing them
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
in an election you're you're really
 
04:18:58.960 --> 04:18:59.910 align:start position:0%
in an election you're you're really
tying

04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
tying
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
that person's hands behind their back
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
um you if you are handing over
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to a vendor
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
who is simply
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the market to make a profit
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily accountable to
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
anybody at that point except that they
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
do a
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
bad job they may lose business
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
the next time around
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of this is we
 
04:19:23.439 --> 04:19:26.309 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of this is we
have

04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably 230 give or take
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
voting jurisdictions whether they're
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
cities or towns
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
and so you're putting in the hands of
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of those
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
couple hundred individuals to make
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate decisions related to
 
04:19:41.600 --> 04:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate decisions related to
elections

04:19:43.110 --> 04:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
that they currently do not have to make
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now the secretary of state
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and this should be made clear that
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
all the ballots that are produced in new
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire go through a uniform process
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
all state ballots are printed exactly
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
they're proof read that the column
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
rotations are
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
are you know made to
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
apply the appropriately to the elections
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
and there is a standard process for
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
making that happen
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
each polling place each of the of the
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
309 or 310 polling places have a unique
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
ballot for that election so you simply
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you're running out you can't call the
 
04:20:23.110 --> 04:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
next town over and say hey you have some
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
balance you can spare that's not the way
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
it works each of those towns has a
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
unique ballot
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the election they're carefully
 
04:20:30.800 --> 04:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
for the election they're carefully
proofed

04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
proofed
 
04:20:32.000 --> 04:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
proofed
and

04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
and there is a
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
significant process undertaken by the
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
state to make sure that
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
the ballots are accurate and uh and
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're properly just distributed to the
 
04:20:42.880 --> 04:20:44.149 align:start position:0%
they're properly just distributed to the
communities

04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's the primary reason why i
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill is that to me it does
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
not make sense
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to make sure the job gets
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
done that you take the one person that's
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
accountable and you spread it out
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
to over over 200
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
entities to make that happen
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
to me that's a recipe for disaster and
 
04:21:07.110 --> 04:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so i would discourage that
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
part of the process though i think is is
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know making sure the public
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
understands better what that process is
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i you know based on the testimony
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
that i have heard so far i think that
 
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
there is an education effort that we
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
need to do to make sure that individuals
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
in the state just know exactly how
 
04:21:29.110 --> 04:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
our elections work and i'm certainly
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
willing to help people understand that
 
04:21:30.640 --> 04:21:33.510 align:start position:0%
willing to help people understand that
process

04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that i'll mention
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
is it right now we do not have a ballot
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
counting device
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
in use in new hampshire that is able to
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
record digital images of ballots
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
so the proposal where they can be simply
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
put up quickly
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
after an election is over
 
04:21:50.399 --> 04:21:51.349 align:start position:0%
after an election is over
uh

04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
it just is not it's just not possible at
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
the beltlock commission has recently
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
approved the use of a
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh a newer different model
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
ballot accounting device for use in the
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
town elections in milford uh coming up
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
and so we'll see where that goes
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
and whether they're more likely to
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
approve a device
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
for state elections moving forward
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
the one concern that i have about
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
posting digital images of ballots all
 
04:22:21.920 --> 04:22:23.269 align:start position:0%
posting digital images of ballots all
ballots

04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
in an election
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
is the same concern that i have making
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
paper ballots available for the public
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
to just
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
open up and look through and that is it
 
04:22:32.960 --> 04:22:33.910 align:start position:0%
open up and look through and that is it
does

04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh open up uh potential for
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
vote buying schemes which were very
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the late 1800s before they
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
went to a
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
unique ballot there are ways that a
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
voter could mark a ballot so that
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that was interested in
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
buying a person's vote could
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
could identify that by being able to
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
simply review ballots cast in any given
 
04:22:56.239 --> 04:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
simply review ballots cast in any given
town

04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:22:59.110 --> 04:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i would be i would want to be very
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
careful that we're not opening another
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
pandora's box by uh by allowing that to
 
04:23:04.080 --> 04:23:04.950 align:start position:0%
pandora's box by uh by allowing that to
happen

04:23:04.950 --> 04:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
so with that i would be happy to answer
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien okay
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's always me um
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
i have these questions uh i have some
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the conditions of the
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
boxes in windham i'd like just to
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
i know that we went through it in the
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
last bill but just to reiterate for
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
anyone that wasn't here
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of complaints about
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
that in this testimony and
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
is the condition of the ballots that
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
came out of windham in the november 2020
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
general election is that a common
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
condition of
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
boxes or is that when i said ballots i
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
meant boxes i'm sorry
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
is this a common condition that that
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
boxes are in or is this an a very rare
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
condition that boxes are in in your
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
experience as secretary of state and
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
formerly a deputy
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
i loosely used an 80 20 percentage rate
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
in my testimony the last time
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
most towns and most town clerks
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
prepare and seal the ballot boxes after
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
but there are some
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh some towns uh that do not
 
04:24:30.309 --> 04:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
do a particularly good job
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
and that can be seen whenever there's a
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
recount you know the towns that
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
that follow the the recommended
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines and procedures you know the
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
boxes are all uniform when they arrive
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
the seals are properly signed
 
04:24:45.429 --> 04:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
the ones that
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
do not do not come in
 
04:24:48.800 --> 04:24:50.389 align:start position:0%
do not do not come in
properly

04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
packaged are quite obvious
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think uh during the recount
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
and again that it's a you know it's it
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
is a training issue um
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh we we provide
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
substantial training to cities and towns
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
prior to an election season but the
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
training sessions are not mandatory
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
so we don't always get everyone
 
04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
showing up
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and there's also turnover in election
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
officials and so that that training is
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
constant and there's always a learning
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
curve for some
 
04:25:21.840 --> 04:25:23.189 align:start position:0%
curve for some
clerks

04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
04:25:23.199 --> 04:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
clerks
so

04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
representative pimento
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh
 
04:25:34.720 --> 04:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh
so

04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't notice these deficiencies
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
unless there was a recount
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't normally go out
 
04:25:44.399 --> 04:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't normally go out
to

04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
every town and
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
check how they package the boxes that's
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
right we don't go out and and check as
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of practice although you
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
know with everything that has happened
 
04:25:55.760 --> 04:25:56.469 align:start position:0%
know with everything that has happened
and

04:25:56.469 --> 04:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
and the nature of the debate today as i
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned than the last hearing uh it
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
might be a good practice to start doing
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
checks thank you representative
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you uh so a
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up for anyone that wasn't here
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
in that last uh bill that we discussed
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be doing more spot
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
checks could you just
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
talk about that again correction just
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
because i don't want people testifying
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
to be put on the stand that is not what
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
he said what he said was that that might
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to have a conversation
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
about incorporating into future
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
practices let's not paraphrase testimony
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of other people we are
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
here and i to all of you to take the
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and respond to it as you hear
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
so the question is what would a spot
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
we would go into a clerk's office and
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
simply ask to see
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
how the the ballots and election
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
materials are being stored
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
we would also at the same time take a
 
04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
look at the logs that are associated
 
04:27:01.120 --> 04:27:02.229 align:start position:0%
look at the logs that are associated
with

04:27:02.229 --> 04:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:27:02.239 --> 04:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
with
the

04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
the ballot counting devices
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that those are
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
kept up to date and they contain proper
 
04:27:08.800 --> 04:27:10.710 align:start position:0%
kept up to date and they contain proper
signatures

04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
signatures
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative terezian thank you madam
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you secretary scanlon
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
for answering the question and i'll add
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
my congratulations to your new position
 
04:27:25.600 --> 04:27:26.550 align:start position:0%
my congratulations to your new position
um

04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
noting the concerns
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
i actually haven't congratulated him
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
because i'm suspecting that he's he may
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
be having second thoughts as this
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
proceeds so i'm leaving my words on it
 
04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
on his
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
appointment for a future date continue
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the 180 day rule or something i
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't know but anyway
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns you noted notwithstanding
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
could you
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
support some of the added security
 
04:27:51.600 --> 04:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
support some of the added security
features

04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
features
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
that are noted in this legislation
 
04:27:59.030 --> 04:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes um certainly we can review the
 
04:27:59.040 --> 04:28:00.630 align:start position:0%
yes um certainly we can review the
reconciliation

04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
reconciliation
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
procedures we do actually recommend as
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
part of our training uh ways that you
 
04:28:07.110 --> 04:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
can reconcile
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh the ballot counts after an election
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
we don't cover all of the areas that
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
people seem to be concerned about
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
so you know there's certainly room for
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
some expansion there
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
and in terms of
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that ballots are not
 
04:28:23.920 --> 04:28:25.110 align:start position:0%
making sure that ballots are not
counterfeit

04:28:25.110 --> 04:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
counterfeit
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know there are ways to put
 
04:28:26.239 --> 04:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
you know there are ways to put
watermarks

04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
watermarks
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know i know of a product that is a
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
synthetic dna that is invisible on the
 
04:28:32.319 --> 04:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
synthetic dna that is invisible on the
ballot

04:28:33.510 --> 04:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
or on the paper and if you put a special
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
light over it it shows up i mean there
 
04:28:40.229 --> 04:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
are tools like that
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that uh that could be used that i don't
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
think would be onerous or
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative growing thank you madam
 
04:28:55.429 --> 04:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
back to the high-speed scanner question
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
are the
 
04:29:02.070 --> 04:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
milford machines that are going in are
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
they scanning machines as opposed to
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
counting machines that we currently have
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the technology that is used currently is
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
the acuvo device which is an optical
 
04:29:11.439 --> 04:29:12.469 align:start position:0%
the acuvo device which is an optical
scan

04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
scan
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
device the newer devices and the one
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
tested in milford is a digital scan and
 
04:29:18.000 --> 04:29:18.870 align:start position:0%
tested in milford is a digital scan and
so

04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
they do have the capability of
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
collecting images of
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
on every ballot
 
04:29:27.990 --> 04:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
as far as scanning then
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
all the ballots regardless of of uh you
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
know whether they're run through current
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
machines or not
 
04:29:36.720 --> 04:29:38.229 align:start position:0%
machines or not
uh

04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be an uh like a different
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
type of high-speed scanner maybe similar
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
to what was used at the
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
in in other words just adding to that
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
this would not be for the purpose of
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
counting the vote for
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
for the election it would be for the
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of recording it for
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
posterity and for the citizens
 
04:30:05.040 --> 04:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
posterity and for the citizens
there

04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
i think we're talking about maybe two
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
different things um the newer the newer
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
model ballot counting devices
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
using the digital scan technology can
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
record the images
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
of every ballot and so those can be
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
pulled up
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
after an election if we're talking about
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
an audit and using a machine
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
check the counts on election night
 
04:30:29.760 --> 04:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
check the counts on election night
um

04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
there are high-speed high-speed scanners
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
that are capable capable of doing that i
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
believe they also could record images if
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
if they were
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
directed to do so
 
04:30:42.960 --> 04:30:44.710 align:start position:0%
directed to do so
okay

04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
and one further question one more
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
04:30:47.680 --> 04:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
if

04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
first of all i i agree with you on the
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
mailing the ballots from a vendor to the
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
various voting places
 
04:30:58.000 --> 04:30:59.269 align:start position:0%
various voting places
um

04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
again similar to to question you were
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
asked if if that's changed
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
we could still have the same
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh authentic authentication
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
device in the ballots but if that were
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
all done through the secretary of state
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
and distributed from the secretary of
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
state would that alleviate your concern
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes i mean that's the way the process is
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
now is that you know we
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
hire a vendor a printer
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
who works with us on preparing the
 
04:31:30.960 --> 04:31:32.070 align:start position:0%
who works with us on preparing the
ballots

04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
part of that process is working with
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the company that that programs the
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices so that the
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
timing marks and everything are
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know are properly placed on the
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
ballot so that the machines can read
 
04:31:44.960 --> 04:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
ballot so that the machines can read
them

04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
once the the ballot design is set the
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
printer prints off the amount that
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
we asked them to print for each town
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:31:59.110 --> 04:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
once they come off the press we have our
 
04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
own staff that package them
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
and ship them make sure that they're
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
delivered to the town
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
 
04:32:13.680 --> 04:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
secretary

04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
04:32:15.840 --> 04:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
secretary
um

04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
as i said we have a few people who have
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
signed up since the hearing started
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask that their comments be
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
hello again and again thank you for the
 
04:32:40.950 --> 04:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
04:32:40.960 --> 04:32:42.309 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
um

04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want i will be quick i want
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
to say that i support the
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
concept of bringing in security measures
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
on the ballots i think that's a good
 
04:32:50.239 --> 04:32:51.510 align:start position:0%
on the ballots i think that's a good
idea

04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:32:54.309 --> 04:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
i agree with the secretary of state
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
that his office should continue to
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
handle the processing and the creation
 
04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the ballots
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
because it is a recipe for disaster and
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
if you distribute that to each of the
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
towns you're assuming that each of those
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
towns assumes what their
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and as i pointed
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
out in an earlier testimony that
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
mistakes are made
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
not everybody understands what their
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
full responsibilities are and it it
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
really could be a real mess for the
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
entire state and because
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
we are the first in the nation we have
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the integrity of our
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
elections are never questioned by
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
anybody outside of our state we don't
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
want to give them valid reasons to do
 
04:33:31.039 --> 04:33:32.789 align:start position:0%
want to give them valid reasons to do
that

04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
in section 4-3
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand the first
 
04:33:36.719 --> 04:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand the first
paragraph

04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
it it says all ballots received shall
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
after inspection be stored in lock boxes
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
can you give us a page and i'm sorry i
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
think it's page
 
04:33:47.840 --> 04:33:49.029 align:start position:0%
think it's page
two

04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:33:49.039 --> 04:33:50.551 align:start position:0%
two
okay

04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
three if you count the cover oh yeah the
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
bolded okay um it just says all ballots
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
received shall after inspection be
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
stored in lock boxes
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
and encrypted
 
04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
such that only the senior election
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
official shall have the ability to
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
access the ballots
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure what that's referring to
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh the word encrypted
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh concerned me and the the other part
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
that concerns me is only the senior
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
election official
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
so when you're providing
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
any one person without any kind of
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
checks and balances or
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
additional controls you're assuming that
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
that person is honorable and trustable
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
and not everybody is unfortunately
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
and you're assuming that they're
 
04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%
competent in their duties
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
and then a third question is that
 
04:34:36.320 --> 04:34:37.189 align:start position:0%
and then a third question is that
if

04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
something happens to that person
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
are they the only holders of the
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
encryption keys
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
so you know there would need to be
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
definitions as to how that if if if
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
things did get encrypted i don't know
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
what it is that would be encrypted
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
but you know i think there's questions
 
04:34:54.150 --> 04:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
there that would have to be answered you
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
didn't you won't want to leave this to
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of each individual
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
town's election officials because that's
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
another disaster for
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
on page 3 it says page 3 at the top
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
i agree that it would be helpful
 
04:35:12.879 --> 04:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
i agree that it would be helpful
for

04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
voter integrity election integrity to
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
keep ballots in a locked facility with
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
video monitoring and logs
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
and lock storage containers
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
i welcome controls for absentee ballots
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
i won't get into them they're all listed
 
04:35:30.561 --> 04:35:32.070 align:start position:0%
i won't get into them they're all listed
there

04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
i agree with the secretary of state i've
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
spent hours
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
talking with the secretary of state
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gardner
 
04:35:43.830 --> 04:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
and secretary scanlon
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
was was
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
was in the room at the time
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
that some of these conversations took
 
04:35:49.680 --> 04:35:50.629 align:start position:0%
that some of these conversations took
place

04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh and you know one of the things that i
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
think is
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the utmost importance and maybe one
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the most important things that the
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
state could do for
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
bringing confidence of voters
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
up to where it should be
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
for election integrity is the ability to
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
make ballots public documents
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
there are if you can finish up that
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
would be great okay
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
there there are multiple things
 
04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i know that rep rowan has some
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
concerns i know that the secretary of
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
state he just
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
expressed a couple concerns about
 
04:36:30.551 --> 04:36:30.561 align:start position:0%
you know the confidentiality of some
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
ballots that might have special markings
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
on them
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
and there's another bill for this and i
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
believe oh no there's not but
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that there will be an
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be brought up that
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
will address this
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
and have everybody's concerns addressed
 
04:36:46.320 --> 04:36:47.189 align:start position:0%
and have everybody's concerns addressed
because

04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
the last conversation i had with
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gardner was that i i
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
think we had
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
um i think we had consensus on most of
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
these things all right if you can finish

we have a few minutes we're trying to do
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
three minutes plus whatever i gave ken
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
mr eyring i'll go as fast as i can okay
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
um first of all thank you and and for me
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'm one of those people
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
who uh believed always in elections i
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
live in kensington new hampshire it's a
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
small town i've been involved planning
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
board and other things for over 30 years
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
and you know i couldn't believe anything
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
there would be any problems and
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
in my town or anywhere else and so like
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
everything else i did my due diligence
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
what concerned me the most is that
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm in support of this bill
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
because we need to do something with
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
trust and transparency
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
we have so many shortfalls in the
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
election process if we take at least
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
this one step it will help us and let me
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
outline it for you um
 
04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
currently there is no chain of custody
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
requirements on the memory chips
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
or the microchips there's no chain of
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
custody and the sec i have a letter from
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office that
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
states that
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's no software security review or
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
defined specifications
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
there's no audit capability or defined
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
by the state secretary of state
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's no best practice audits by the
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
town clerks to review
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
or inspect the activity logs and those
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
are really important
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
there's no security directives updates
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
to the machines since august i'm sorry
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
april 9 2010
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
and there's no testing against any
 
04:39:02.719 --> 04:39:04.709 align:start position:0%
and there's no testing against any
controls

04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
controls
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
and what frightens me the most is this
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
last statement by jeffrey soristo who is
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
head of lhs who we trust with everything
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
here in the town in the state
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
it says in on march 2021 our systems are
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
also subjected its lhs systems to a
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
post-election audit in connecticut
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
massachusetts vermont and a push for
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
those random
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
audits because we feel it's important to
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
the integrity of the system the reason
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
why there is no post-election audit in
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is because there's no
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislation directing one to occur a
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill is currently being considered to do
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
just that
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
so we have so many other shortfalls in
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
our system if we can at least start with
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
ballot integrity it will be a great step
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
for us going forward
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions from
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i would like to
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
pick up uh from him what he's saying is
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
like in the windham audit um harry
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
hursty the auditor he said in europe you
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
automatically have an audit right after
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the election
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
not in u.s
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
so um we need to have that in place and
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's one and second is
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
when you consider this bill and i
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
is that if we need to have the machine
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
that can read all these new marks and
 
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
stuff like that uh let's break it up not
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
just all by lhs which is the one vendor
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
that supply all the machine in the in
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and the whole new england
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
they supply the machine they're testing
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the machine and they maintain the
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
machine and they check the machine it's
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
like you ask one person to do the whole
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
thing so who doing the audit of this
 
04:40:58.638 --> 04:40:59.430 align:start position:0%
thing so who doing the audit of this
work

04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
of this machine to make sure that they
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
work properly and machines do make
 
04:41:03.360 --> 04:41:04.550 align:start position:0%
work properly and machines do make
mistake

04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that is very dangerous
 
04:41:07.280 --> 04:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
so that is very dangerous
and

04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
the records that we see at the windham
 
04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
audit all these towns is all messed up
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know when people brought it in they
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
had to like
 
04:41:19.030 --> 04:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
wait half an hour for them to sort
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
things out it's all messed up and those
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
high-speed machines the scanning machine
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about well in
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
reality we have to wait for them to run
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
to stables and pick up these cheapy
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
machines but they set up to scan that
 
04:41:34.798 --> 04:41:36.070 align:start position:0%
machines but they set up to scan that
day

04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
the whole other set up not prepare this
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a cheap machine and standing like
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
like what what high-speed machine this
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
is a cheesy machine was it in my own
 
04:41:45.440 --> 04:41:46.470 align:start position:0%
is a cheesy machine was it in my own
office

04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
so i support high-speed scanning machine
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
high quality to store all these ballasts
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we can still as long as we need we
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't need a lot of space for that
 
04:41:57.840 --> 04:41:58.628 align:start position:0%
don't need a lot of space for that
and

04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:58.638 --> 04:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
the uh in merrimack election there was
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
this one person he received a ballot is
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
pre-marked with a candidate that he
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support i interviewed him
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
so and then they didn't have enough
 
04:42:14.070 --> 04:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
ballots for the day so they had to copy
 
04:42:14.080 --> 04:42:15.270 align:start position:0%
ballots for the day so they had to copy
more

04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
paper ballot you know and the same thing
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
happened in
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
in um
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
in bedford and when i went there for the
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
recounts many of my friends watched the
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
video and said you know what child
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have the chance of custody
 
04:42:29.120 --> 04:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
they don't have the chance of custody
right

04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
and it's so easy to make these copies of
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
these ballots so we don't even know
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
these boxes balance is legit
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's how much faith we have right now
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
in our election process so please
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
support this bill because this is so
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
important and the law needs to be
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
updated on these this thing because like
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
online crime we didn't have way back
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
then now we have all this technology to
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
track every package that you do
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
why not tracking our ballot i receive
 
04:43:00.868 --> 04:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for november election
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know i'm not supposed to
 
04:43:04.470 --> 04:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
receive these things
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know otherwise i would have kept it
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
and bring it to the aeg and process all
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
these things
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
so who sent this ballast in
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
i didn't request it
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony does
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
oh by the way one more
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
at the windham
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
sorry one box in there the label is a
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
box it's a printing company in
 
04:43:27.920 --> 04:43:29.590 align:start position:0%
box it's a printing company in
california

04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
california
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
in california
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
how is that that new hampshire balance
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
gets stored in a box from california a
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
printing company
 
04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is weird that doesn't show up in
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
your report in the forensic audit
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
all right that concludes the the
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that i have signed up to

speak on hb
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
1522 there were individuals who
 
04:43:58.948 --> 04:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
indicated their supporter opposition to
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
the bill remotely by registering online
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
74 people supported this bill online and
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
three opposed thank you representative
 
04:44:12.400 --> 04:44:13.990 align:start position:0%

and in regards to people that did not
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill we had three people

sign up and they were all in favor of
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%

1527
 
04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
is a bill relative to the storage of
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
total vote counts produced by the
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices and
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill is with us
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce it
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative yakovovic

04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.040 --> 04:45:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%

i'm
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
the merrimack district 24
 
04:45:12.160 --> 04:45:12.948 align:start position:0%
the merrimack district 24
um

04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
and the bill
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
deals with the information the
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
information we have um
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
tapes that machines print
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
the receipts um
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably a simpler bill
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
here i'm trying to capture the
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
information we got and presented to the
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
public so these requests
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
um to get to the data the the receipts
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the machines
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
came to me from concessions from people
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
outside of town people in town
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere there was a lot of hearsay
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
after the election i i was actually
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
helping with the recount of the wyndham
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
election and everybody was shocked when
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
we saw the 400 vote discrepancies there
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then people started looking for
 
04:45:55.280 --> 04:45:56.868 align:start position:0%
and then people started looking for
explanation

04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
on their own and they didn't have much
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
to go by so
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
if they had some more data maybe they
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
could have helped or uncovered some and
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
if um i i lean towards providing
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
information to the people so they can
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
draw their own conclusions rather than
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
giving them something
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
post-processed something we interpret
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
because they probably will not
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
trust much anyway
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
and they do want to see the the source
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm asking for the tapes
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the machines to be photographed
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
um at the at the end of the day the
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
moderator could do it the town clerk and
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
email to
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
04:46:36.400 --> 04:46:37.350 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
and

04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
that record would be kept
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the website the isos website could be
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
presented to the public of each town
 
04:46:49.590 --> 04:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
the original tapes would stay in the
 
04:46:49.600 --> 04:46:50.788 align:start position:0%
the original tapes would stay in the
town

04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:46:53.830 --> 04:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah this will provide the uniformity
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
basically in the eyes of the public
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
anybody could be able to see what the
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
machines counted
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
probably in the windham case since one
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the machines provided a lot of
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
overvotes that
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
would have been questioned right away by
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
members of the public so anybody who's
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with forensics
 
04:47:15.430 --> 04:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
could identify some issues there
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
um so the tapes the taste would be kept
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
in in towns the
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
scans of photographs would be sent up to
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
the sos
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
office to be posted online and then
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
sometime later the sos could transcribe
 
04:47:32.550 --> 04:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
them into a spreadsheet which is
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
which will show
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
per town how many machines were used
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
what the outcome
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
of which what the total counts of each
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
machine were over votes configuration of
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
the machine settings things like that
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
if they could populate this spreadsheet
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
no special specialized equipment is
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
needed you know the night of the
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
election this is all they need to take
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's what the deal is about
 
04:48:03.600 --> 04:48:05.350 align:start position:0%
that's what the deal is about
transparency

04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
providing information to people and
 
04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
let them deal with it
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
so we're not hiding anything thank you
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
04:48:20.000 --> 04:48:21.670 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
um

04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's really two-part question could you
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
explain to me what
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
reports for options settings sort
 
04:48:29.830 --> 04:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
settings and tally settings mean
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
and does the accuvo tabulator generate
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
those kinds of reports now or can it if
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm not the
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
top most expert into the machines but i
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
believe they can be configured
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
differently in
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
um different locations
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
so we're going after the configuration
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
settings of the machines
 
04:48:50.320 --> 04:48:51.590 align:start position:0%
settings of the machines
um

good job so
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's not much more for me to say i
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
did want to
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
point out that this would be one way
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
that people can see
 
04:49:50.958 --> 04:49:52.230 align:start position:0%
that people can see
the

04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
number of overvotes which is printed at
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
the top of the
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
battle report the tape
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
if the bill we discussed earlier today
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
goes through then this would still show
 
04:50:06.390 --> 04:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
it but it would show it on the
 
04:50:06.400 --> 04:50:09.270 align:start position:0%
it but it would show it on the
individual

04:50:09.270 --> 04:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.280 --> 04:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
races

04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
races
 
04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
but overall it makes things clearer for
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
everybody who wants to take an interest
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for mr c
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative tarousian
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
i thank you madam chair thank you mr c
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
for taking the question i don't know if
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know not and i don't so that's why
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm asking uh
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
what happens with those tapes now are
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
they retained at the town level does the
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state get them
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah do you know the answer
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know the complete answer i do
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
know that uh
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
the town clerk has to keep a copy but it
 
04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
usually it's kept in the box sealed up
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the ballots
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
after the election so
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a copy and didn't
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
post one up on the
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
the wall in the
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
clerk's office or something like that
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
and there i don't know that there's a
 
04:51:02.948 --> 04:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
standard on what's supposed to be done
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they're supposed to
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
print out three of those reports on each
 
04:51:06.638 --> 04:51:11.190 align:start position:0%
print out three of those reports on each
machine

04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
further questions for mr c
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill as
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
hi uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%

04:51:31.040 --> 04:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
um

04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill for voter
 
04:51:35.440 --> 04:51:36.708 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill for voter
integrity

04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
and election integrity
 
04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
this will make it easy for people to
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
actually help
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
view the results of each town
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
and to see if there's any anomalies that
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
are taking place in any of the towns
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
i know they're speaking from first hand
 
04:51:56.550 --> 04:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
because there were there's a group of
 
04:51:56.560 --> 04:51:57.590 align:start position:0%
because there were there's a group of
people

04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
who literally went to every town to
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
collect the paper tapes
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
those paper tapes were then put into
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and then we we
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the results of every machine
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
in every town that we acquired
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work hundreds and hundreds
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
of hours just to get to the paper tapes
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of traveling
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was kind of like a sister bill
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the bill that you talked about i
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
believe yesterday with the voter
 
04:52:23.360 --> 04:52:24.708 align:start position:0%
believe yesterday with the voter
checklist

04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
04:52:24.718 --> 04:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
checklist
where

04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
i asked where the bill asks that the
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
voter checklist be published
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
online at the secretary of state's
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
office because that's also a process
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
where you have to go to each individual
 
04:52:36.638 --> 04:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
where you have to go to each individual
town

04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get the checklist
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours lots of travel
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
lots of wasted fuel
 
04:52:44.560 --> 04:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
lots of wasted fuel
so

04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
you know if if the now the paper tapes
 
04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
when they come out they're stored at the
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
town level after the elections
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal for
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
the town clerks to take images or scans
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
of these and then send them as a file to
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office that's
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
minimal work
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
but it will save citizens hundreds and
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
it provides transparency
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
and again you know one of the things
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
that i'm most focused on is the
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
perception of new hampshire's elections
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
because we're the first in the nation
 
04:53:19.600 --> 04:53:20.708 align:start position:0%
because we're the first in the nation
state

04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
and questions were raised
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
due to
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
what took place in wyndham
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you know the state stepped up uh
 
04:53:29.200 --> 04:53:30.070 align:start position:0%
and you know the state stepped up uh
they

04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
you this committee passed the bill
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know sb43 in order to allow that
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
type of transparency to take place
 
04:53:38.480 --> 04:53:40.230 align:start position:0%
type of transparency to take place
so

04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know this info is already
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
available on the 91a
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
so we're not asking for anything that's
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the data would be
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
segregated by every machine
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
this ties into some of the concerns
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
that i expressed earlier because you'd
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
be able to see overvotes you'd be able
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
to see if machines are working properly
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
or not you'd have more rise on the data
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
to potentially point out to town
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
election officials that maybe there's
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
something they should look into
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know i don't see any drawbacks to
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more work for the
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office that have to
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
assign someone
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
to transcribe the data from the
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the paper tapes to
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
alex to the spreadsheet so they could
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
get posted
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
i did speak about this with secretary
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
gardner last year
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
he expressed a concern that they
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that within a few days the
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
election and my response was you know
 
04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
even if it's a month
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know that would be fine you know we

04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
i believe he was there for part of the
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
conversation that i had with secretary
 
04:54:57.030 --> 04:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
gardner i'm hoping there's no issue
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
there i don't want to speak for him on
 
04:54:58.480 --> 04:54:59.750 align:start position:0%
there i don't want to speak for him on
this

04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
but all of that is uh
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
this is a really important bill if
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
if if this state is is
 
04:55:06.878 --> 04:55:10.310 align:start position:0%
if if this state is is
really

04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.320 --> 04:55:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
serious

04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
about um you know
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
transparency and election integrity i
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe this would would help
 
04:55:18.000 --> 04:55:19.110 align:start position:0%
believe this would would help
elevate

04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
elevate
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know what we're trying to do as a
 
04:55:21.520 --> 04:55:22.470 align:start position:0%
uh you know what we're trying to do as a
state

04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
to provide as much information to the
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
public as possible
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
the question by rep bergeron about the
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
the types of settings the tally settings
 
04:55:34.550 --> 04:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
the sort settings
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
this language in here there's different
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
types of reports that are generated
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:55:41.520 --> 04:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
and um
rep

04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
rep
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
yakubovic had asked me what the name of
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
that report is and i didn't know so i
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
gave him
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
i gave him all of the things that are
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
printed on the paper tape and these are
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
the things so you know this would
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
specify the report but not by name
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know what that name of
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
the report was
 
04:56:01.350 --> 04:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not something that that you
 
04:56:01.360 --> 04:56:02.390 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not something that that you
know

04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
generates more work it's just the report
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
that you choose when you say print
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
report which one and then it spits out
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the machine that's all i have thank
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
you very much for the time
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%

like thrown at me like crazy you watch
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
these things on the news but i don't
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
know what it is
 
04:57:10.320 --> 04:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
know what it is
so

04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is an important thing that you know
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
we should put i support this bill of
 
04:57:16.798 --> 04:57:17.788 align:start position:0%
we should put i support this bill of
course

04:57:17.788 --> 04:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
course
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
1527 because it should be available for
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to trust but verify like president
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
reagan said
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i've been at the education
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
testifying to these bills that to teach
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
civil civil rights and information about
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
constitution to our children so these
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
should be good example so our students
 
04:57:44.550 --> 04:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
our children our future leaders should
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
know what to look for to ensure that
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
they have a place in this country in the
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
future so they need to have real stuff
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
so when we walk into or we just watch
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
the news or just walk into the election
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
we know what it is we the peasants
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
should know what it is
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
not just
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
this professional up there
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
monopolize everything like lhs
 
04:58:09.030 --> 04:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
monopolize everything in our elections
 
04:58:09.040 --> 04:58:10.390 align:start position:0%
monopolize everything in our elections
equipment

04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is wrong so this builds it looks
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
small but it's important and i go to
 
04:58:18.550 --> 04:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
this election they usually tape this
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
result on the wall someplace very we
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
usually take a picture and we post it on
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
facebook so our friends are watching it
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
or a live stream of people watching it
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
but we are just a few influences if it
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
goes on to the secretary of state and
 
04:58:36.550 --> 04:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
the official websites of the town the
 
04:58:38.948 --> 04:58:38.958 align:start position:0%
whole town should be looking out for
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
election integrity because the result of
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
