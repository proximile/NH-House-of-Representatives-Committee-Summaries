00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
have camberells are you sure about that
 
00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 align:start position:0%
I mean you were in there for a long time
 
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
because what they said to me was that
 
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 align:start position:0%
their terminology of average
 
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 align:start position:0%
compensation was tied to pension the way
 
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
they figure out their pensions and as
 
00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 align:start position:0%
opposed to average salary that you know
 
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
the final salary did you get that
 
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.590 align:start position:0%
the final salary did you get that
clarified

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
yes and so that's why I'm saying this is
 
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
the section average final compensation
 
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
shall mean this is the part of law that
 
00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
defines what average final compensation
 
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
is and if you look at the amendment to
 
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 250
 
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's what that's the phrase we're
 
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.010 align:start position:0%
that's what that's the phrase we're
using

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
right so I am pretty sure about it
 
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
um we've just delayed everything yeah so
 
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.410 align:start position:0%
um we've just delayed everything yeah so
um

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 250 average final
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
compensation and you'll notice by the
 
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
way in the in the amendment to House
 
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 250 existing law for group one uses
 
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
that same phrase average final
 
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
compensation so this pair this you know
 
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
this set of this section of law says for
 
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
group two average final compensation is
 
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
this for group one average final
 
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
compensation is that and they're very
 
00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
very similar they're not different in
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
the way that they're talking right so
 
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
I'm very I'm very sure about this one
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but we're we're you know we we have a
 
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
an extra week now because of the delay
 
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
an extra week now because of the delay
so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
um we could get an official word from
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
Marty or something like that if we if we
 
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
want to right well I see you're still
 
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
alive so they must have agreed with you
 
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.770 align:start position:0%
alive so they must have agreed with you
right

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 align:start position:0%
so there's a fire over in his hometown
 
00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
but but they may have a point with
 
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
regard to 436. right so my intention
 
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the amendment to House Bill 436 was
 
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
to take away was to change the
 
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
three-year thing to five years right but
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
not to change the whole basis of the of
 
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
the calculation right so it was to be
 
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking but it seems like at least
 
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
what they think is that
 
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
is that it's not really they're not
 
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
really getting their highest three years
 
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
or five years they're getting something
 
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
very different than that and so
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
to answer that question we really do
 
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 align:start position:0%
need Marty I think
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
um and I sent him an email I don't know
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
if he's responded yet but
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
I will follow up on this I did send
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
Marty an email on 250 because I know we
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
sent him the amendment we had gone back
 
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
and forth with it but we I gave him the
 
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
official Amendment a few minutes before
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
he had to leave so I just wanted to make
 
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
sure he agreed that it worked as you're
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
you intended I haven't heard back yet
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
we've kind of been going back and forth
 
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
but as soon as I know I'll let
 
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire know to confirm
 
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.009 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire know to confirm
that

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
in some sense
 
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not crucial right I mean if we
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
agree in principle to putting 436 in the
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
budget we can certainly do it and
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's lots of time before the budget
 
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
becomes law to make changes to the
 
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
section if it turns out that that it's
 
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate or whatever I mean
 
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
even after it passes the house it's got
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
a whole nother bite at the Apple after
 
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
the Senate and so on so
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
um you know if this isn't right now and
 
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
and we can't be very certain about it we
 
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
can just take the first amendment that
 
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
they gave us uh last last week and do it
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
that way you know so
 
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.210 align:start position:0%
that way you know so
but

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
I would like to do it my way if it is
 
00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.630 align:start position:0%
I would like to do it my way if it is
right

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
um we'll try to get some answers because
 
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
I heard from folks too after your
 
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
meeting and they disagreed with your
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get that squared up
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.009 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
um

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
anything else we'd like to take up while
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I guess the first thing
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
was we had made an inquiry about the
 
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
granite Place Building whether there was
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
any possibility of arpa funds I don't
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
know if you've heard back from them on
 
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.570 align:start position:0%
know if you've heard back from them on
that

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
I have two emails out and still no
 
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
response yet back okay and then the
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
other thing was in hb2 do you you guys
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
remember we took the 40 million dollars
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
out and then we left the 10 million and
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
we removed the words and constructing we
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
just had designing and so I was a little
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable just sort of making that
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
change without checking back with the
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um Mike and Melissa did check back with
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
them and they did have some clarifying
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
language and I don't know if you have
 
00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.170 align:start position:0%
language and I don't know if you have
that

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
if people would give me a second I'll
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
look up your email and then I can it's
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
not complicated and we could just get
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
rid of this issue so
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can I yes okay so what John
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hanson said was that he would suggest
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
adding the language as follows
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
preliminary design and complete site
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
survey and he explained all the things
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
that that would allow him to do so I I'd
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
like to suggest that we are a little
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
more precise in how the money is going
 
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
to be spent and change the language as
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
suggested by doc because right now all
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
so excuse me since we were given a brand
 
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.930 align:start position:0%
so excuse me since we were given a brand
new

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
document of seven pages now with what
 
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
we've already accomplished
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh I believe Mr Hoffman or Melissa
 
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
passed it out just before we went
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
to lunch and there are a couple of
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
we might be able to whittle down if you
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
have that document in front of you does
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
it have a date it's uh was it's dated
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
so everything on the first page has been
 
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.129 align:start position:0%
so everything on the first page has been
addressed

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
so we go to
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
section number four
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's a newer one than that probably
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
that one right there in your hand yeah
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
so the first page is completely shadowed
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
out so that means it's all been
 
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
addressed so we have
 
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
section 42 the historic housing
 
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
preservation tax credit we were waiting
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
for something apparently from Ways and
 
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
I have not received anything but I don't
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
know if we've reached it
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
I thought I'm not I don't remember which
 
00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.450 align:start position:0%
I thought I'm not I don't remember which
member

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
let's do cheer I'll be right back I'm
 
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:01.700 align:start position:0%
gonna go get my box of goodies all right
 
00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:07.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
so for the I can give you an update yes
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
just because I've been following it for
 
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 231 which has this exact
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
language in it they were we were hoping
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
they would exact last Tuesday on if they
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
did not org up onto Wednesday they did
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
not but I believe they'll be hearing it
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
this week but this the historic housing
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
tax credit does have an implication
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
because there's it's a
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
um a credit against the bet the business
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax the business profits tax
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh five million dollars so I believe the
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going off the cup I had but I
 
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.300 align:start position:0%
believe the impact was
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
3.25 million a year if the full 5
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
million was given out on a credit and
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
they were to use that credit against
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
their subsequent tax periods or
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
liability okay thanks appreciate it
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and it was modeled after
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
the um Community Development Finance
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
Authority credit
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
so any thoughts
 
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.370 align:start position:0%
so any thoughts
members

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
not being ever on ways and means I
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't have any thoughts exactly
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
but it says
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um it's intent they want to be able to
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
convert historical structures to better
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
residential use and it's intended to be
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
income generating
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
so it's a housing issue obviously
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
Melissa you have any idea what the uh
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
RSA 77a those
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
taxes imposed by sure that is the BPT
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax credit okay uh
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
77e is business Enterprise tax credit
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I keep saying credit at
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
the End Business Enterprise tax and RSA
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
400a is the insurance premium tax oh I'm
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
sorry I guess I did hear you say that
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
too many things floating around in our
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire yeah so
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um this one to me it just seems very
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of convoluted because basically in
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
in order to create this fund that will
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
be given to people who are doing
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
historic preservation
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
um we're going to tell businesses that
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
they can direct a certain amount of
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
their tax money into the fund and will
 
00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:37.019 align:start position:0%
pay them back 65 percent of whatever
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
value they put into the fund right so
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
it'll cost them
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know if they put in a hundred
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
dollars it costs them thirty five
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in a sense right 100 goes into
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
the fund they get back 65 on their taxes
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and they actually are it's gonna
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost them thirty five dollars like that
 
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.310 align:start position:0%
cost them thirty five dollars like that
um

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know it might be simpler just to
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
keep charging them their you know their
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
taxes and put into this fund however
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
much we want to allocate to that fund
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
and be done with it right so
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.180 align:start position:0%
sure but but you know at some point
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's all part of the incentive that's
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
involved in you know so I don't know it
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
just and it also seems like a lot of
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork because whoever wants to do
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
this has to apply to dra saying I want
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
100 000 worth or something and and dra
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
has to add all those up and say okay
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have to stop at 5 million so you can
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
have your hundred thousand you can have
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
your whatever and you know it seems like
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of paperwork involved rather than
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
just allocating some whatever we want to
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
put into this fund
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
well since excuse me since we've already
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
heard that there is a bill in the Senate
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
with identical language I suppose we
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
could as the Senate do their work yeah
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
let them do something yeah decide later
 
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:15.500 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
I mean okay with that representative
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I would say that makes
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
sense especially because we're
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
tying ourselves in pretzels here and we
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
have no input from our own ways and
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
means committee on the decision
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
so all right so Melissa will strike 42
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
so now we go to this invest New
 
00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
so now we go to this invest New
Hampshire

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this a little bit
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
it's a substantial amount of money it's
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
all General funds it used to be arpa
 
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.550 align:start position:0%
all General funds it used to be arpa
funds

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
so thoughts
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
on section 43.
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah Joe that's right thank you Mr
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
chairman we had a brief conversation
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
earlier about this I haven't put
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
anything into writing uh because I
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't want to talk among the division
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
about it so I invest in h is a program
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's more Market based for Workforce
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
housing or any sort of type of housing
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
that they can either accelerate the
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities approving the housing or
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
assist the developers through loans to
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
build it whereas the affordable housing
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
fund administered by NH housing which is
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
separate from the state uh is the
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
federal matching grant program just for
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
my ID I I have a couple of ideas sort of
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
layered into hb2 on this area
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
I think the invest NH there there's a
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
problem for problematic to me
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
regarding the grants and Loans to
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Developers for the
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
expansion of Workforce housing I think
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
these programs invest NH and the
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund do complement
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
each other in which the affordable
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
housing fund and NH housing will
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
actually look at the developers
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
portfolio or their sources of financing
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
and change their allocation at the end
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
of it based on the use of invest and age
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
funds in the development I think we
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
should just focus invest in h on the
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
grants to the municipalities strike out
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
the loans to developers because these
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
are this is essentially any developer
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
not just Workforce housing or affordable
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
housing any developer can get a loan
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
from the state to build housing I don't
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
think that there's a need for that in
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
the financial Market I think if it's the
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
affordable housing project and they want
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
the loan from NH housing they can go get
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
the loan from NH housing whereas the
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
grants from invest in h would be grants
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
to municipalities to under my thinking
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
not currently in hb2 but grants to
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
municipalities to incentivize the
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
approval process because that's where
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the real issues is
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities will say well the impact
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
fees that we have or whatnot aren't
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
going to be able to maintain the roads
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
from this new project or the water
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
pipelines or whatnot so let's focus the
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
grants from invest NH to in in our
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
version of hb2 to just grants from to
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities let the housing fund be
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
loans so I'd like to make that change
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
and then also because it has been made a
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
priority from the other body via the 231
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
that they have I think we can also then
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
reduce the amounts for both programs to
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
help us balance our side of the budget
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
and you know if the other body wishes to
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
then increase them back to these levels
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
they're free to do that with their money
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
but I think for us we could keep the
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
programs intact but maybe bring invest
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
NH down to 15 and bring the affordable
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
housing fund to 15 as well to make about
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
a 25 million dollar reduction in this
 
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.590 align:start position:0%
a 25 million dollar reduction in this
area

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
would seem practical and pragmatic to me
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
and making the fix to invest in age so
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's my idea I'm happy to get that
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
drafted uh the language drafted to make
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
that change formally but that's where my
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
head is that
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
all right appreciate the work you've
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
done on this and sounds like a fairly
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
good suggestion to me representative
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
grassy yeah and Mr chairman and I you
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
know I I think what you had started out
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
sounded like a pretty good idea but when
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
you came down to cutting the money I
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
mean housing isn't critical critical
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
need for the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
reducing this amount of money is
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
problematic I could see you know the
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
housing authorities money should or the
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire housing should stay
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
there and this invest in age I wouldn't
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
be as as opposed to seeing us reduce the
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
invest NH portion of that money down to
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
maybe a smaller amount but to basically
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is eliminating
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and putting invest in
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
H's responsibilities
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure exactly I didn't
 
00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
understand exactly if you're going to
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
put all the responsibilities in in New
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
no sorry so I I would propose to make
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
invest in h just grants to
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities bring their budget line
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
down to 15 million okay so reducing that
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
from 30 million to 15 million okay and
 
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
then the affordable housing fund not
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
changing the the statute on our
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with NH housing and what
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
their so their amounts not changing
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
because I thought you said you're going
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
to drop theirs down so I would drop
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
theirs down 10 million uh from the 25
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
they requested down to 14 million which
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
is still more than we we have typically
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
given them in the budget but I think the
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
thing is is that housing is a priority
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
in the state and I would hate to see us
 
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
reduce their funding I think invest in h
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
we could drop that down but leave the
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority where it is just to
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
show that we are concerned about that I
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
know you're saying let the Senate decide
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to trust the Senate to
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
make any responsible decisions as well I
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
think we should we should hang tough on
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
our side of this no I I appreciate that
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
but I also I believe the Senate has
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
passed 231 which includes the funding at
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
this levels then we should keep it at
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
this level
 
00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:13.549 align:start position:0%
this level
so

00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
area if we get rid of the loan aspect
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
and invest New Hampshire isn't the loan
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
repayment a way of
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
renewing the funds that are available
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
for Grants and Loans so from so invest
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
in h is fairly new it was created last
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
summer and this is the second year of it
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
and the first year it has General funds
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the NH housing has the separate has
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
really a separate fund beyond the
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
federal matching fund that we're
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
investing to for the loan repayments and
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
like the 40-year financing that they
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
offer so I know they do we we don't
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
really have that with invest in h where
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
their loans are generating future
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
revenues and even if they were they
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be generating them for years
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
can I ask one other question sure so is
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
is this the way it's proposed in this
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
document the way in invest New Hampshire
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
already exists as a program doesn't it
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
it was funded with the 100 million
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
dollars of arpa funds
 
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.250 align:start position:0%
dollars of arpa funds
um

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
so if we change the language of this our
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the existing
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
it's funded by General funds now so it's
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
no longer you no longer have the federal
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean now if we do this what we're
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
doing is we're continuing a program that
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
we started with the arpa funds right so
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we set the terms of
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire that we were using
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
the arba funds for so I don't know how
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
many federal limitations there are on it
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just not sure your idea has
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
good Merit I just don't wanna
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
fiddle with something that the gum
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's already functional maybe people
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
know more about this than I do
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure Melissa Mr Hoffman I
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I jogged across the
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
street was I had a couple of handouts
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
one from uh former represented umberger
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
and one from Ben Frost
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I've been hanging on to them until
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
you discuss these sections so all right
 
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:43.870 align:start position:0%
you discuss these sections so all right
perfect

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll just say I figured this language
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
came from the governor in the way that
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
the program is currently set up
 
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
the program is currently set up
foreign

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
although I guess it's not in law in any
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
way right because this all looks brand
 
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.230 align:start position:0%
way right because this all looks brand
new

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things I think that
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
what we want to see is is I think that
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know particularly what
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney is talking about
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
is is municipalities
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
be basically the controller of this this
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
money by through grants that they can
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
get to put towards
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
um you know different types of projects
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
that are not in funded by the private
 
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.490 align:start position:0%
that are not in funded by the private
sector

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
and would it prohibit
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
um government you know like a community
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to work with like Catholic
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
Charities to do something would it
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
prohibit that I don't believe it would
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I think I want to step sort of back
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
and get into
 
00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
and get into
um

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
the the truth behind the housing crisis
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
that we're in
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
um it's largely a crisis of Supply yeah
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
right there is not
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
so to my knowledge and what I've I've
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
seen uh for the last few years it's not
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
a funding portion from the private
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
Equity or or public funds to build more
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
housing it's not a financing issue
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
because it's profitable it's a
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
profitable Enterprise even at Workforce
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
and affordable housing there are funds
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and financing for it the issue are the
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
incentives to the municipalities to
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
approve more projects that that's the
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
linchpin that is actually driving the
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
supply crisis and and the supply side
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
problem that we're seeing with housing
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's why I I would
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
rather focus it on the incentives to
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to those you know Board
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen councils and planning
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
boards to approve more projects that fit
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
for their towns
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
that's why I think the state funds and
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
invest in h should be directed just
 
00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:44.299 align:start position:0%
towards the grants incentivizing
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
approvals to plans because I I I'm I
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
believe that the financial financial
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
industry and developers have access to
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
the capital they need if their project
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
is is good but their projects need
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
funding based on the approval from the
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities and incentivizing
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to build more housing is
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that we can do with the grant
 
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.370 align:start position:0%
one thing that we can do with the grant
program

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
I agree with some of that I I mean there
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
are certainly I think there still is a
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
an affordability standard that maybe
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
this would help uh achieve Workforce
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
housing most people at work can't afford
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
them uh you know that's a problem with
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing particularly if you're
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the Seacoast area
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's something that this may
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
be the proposal that you have may be
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
something that would be excellent to do
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
that and I'm also looking at alternative
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities as well that
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities could sponsor whereas it
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
may not be profitable for a a for-profit
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
group to to do as well you know there
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
are other things we have for for
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
unhoused individuals right now that that
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
this as a grant program could help out
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why I hate to see it reduced
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
because I think you're going to see 15
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars is going to last long
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
but 15 but I would be willing to go as
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
low as 15 million dollars as long as you
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't affect the New Hampshire housing
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget so that would
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
basically be cutting the invest in New
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire down but I think you know and
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
umberger's letter here certainly talks
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
about the crisis in housing as well so
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
that she certainly supports fully
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
funding it absolutely Sheriff I may I I
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with you 100 I have no
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh reason to believe that the budget
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
that the governor will sign in June will
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
have 50 million dollars for housing in
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
it I just think we can sort of set the
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
blinders on invest in h to being the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
grant program uh and making our math
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
work better for our side of the budget
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
knowing that by the time it gets to June
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's going to be restored
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
so I just well I do want to make that
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
clear I know it sounds like you know not
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
as optimistic as you are on that one
 
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:50.900 align:start position:0%
that it'll be restored
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
well the fact that this sentence past
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
other legislation in the Senate will
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
have you know likely to have more higher
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue numbers than us uh would lead me
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
to believe that they'd be able to
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
restore a priority of theirs
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
but I we're free to disagree on that
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is not a breaker so
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
Ross letter is quite interesting because
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
it does as you've probably seen there
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
have never been any federal funds
 
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
have never been any federal funds
received

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
and I thought there had been some
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
mistake in there but
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
and also the amount of real estate
 
00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:29.419 align:start position:0%
transfer tax which I believe is at
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
r-e-t-t has been helping to fund
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
the housing fund for um
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of years with some substantial
 
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.529 align:start position:0%
a couple of years with some substantial
contributions

00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:44.289 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:44.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire any I I think he
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
just didn't list the federal stuff well
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
it says in his letter that there's no if
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
you look up uh oh his third paragraph
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
did not receive any Opera funds and has
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
never received Federal funding
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a different fund that
 
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a different fund that
they

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
you know the affordable housing that's
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Housing Authority and
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
um I think we had oh here's you can see
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
that in the past what we've done is
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
we've had general fund bonds supporting
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
the housing fund there's a couple of
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
times we did operating funds but I know
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
just being on public works we did um we
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
did some Capital Appropriations for it
 
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
were those federal funds no no no that's
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm sorry yeah the issue as far as
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
Federal funding I'm not aware that
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
was the Federal peace
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah that's we always worked on that
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
with them because it's loans it's okay
 
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:55.580 align:start position:0%
to bond and then loan back right
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair it's not clear from um it's
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
not vital that we know but uh it's not
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
clear from representative umberger's
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
letter where whether these
 
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.970 align:start position:0%
letter where whether these
um

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
the money here was flowing to the
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
municipality or to the developer or if
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
that would make a difference to them
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know I guess I was thinking I
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
wonder if you made a grant to a
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
municipality if they would be then able
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
to use some of those Grant Monies to
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
work with Developers
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to use some of the money
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
to promote something within their
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
Community I couldn't answer that
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
my only attempt at answering that would
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
be we would simply make it as a
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
perimeter that the program was to make
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
grants to municipalities uh for the
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
purpose of accelerating the approval and
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
construction of Workforce housing would
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
keep that language in
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I want to get into the
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
the depths of what the grants can then
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
be used for but if they could use them
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
in that way I think I think Bea would
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
have to set up an approval process an
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
application process for what you know
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
what a municipality would get per unit
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
being constructed
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
could be used for extending water lines
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
or I think the infrastructure
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
improvements are the key that
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
municipality because it's it's always
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
the you know not in my backyard
 
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.529 align:start position:0%
the you know not in my backyard
um

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
frame reference where it's going to
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
increase the impacts to Services due to
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
a project and so that's where I think
 
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.100 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure Investments
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
municidality can make while uh Workforce
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
housing or affordable housing project
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
are coming to town for some small towns
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's the key to getting it approved
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's the blockage so many towns it is
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman did we ever receive
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
anything back from New Hampshire housing
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
where we stood or they stood
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
specifically for the amount of money
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
that they've loaned out what they have
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
available I think we discussed that but
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
ever get anything back I think
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney's made some good
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
points and one of the things
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and I were
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
speaking to some the other members of
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the other divisions this morning in
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
is looking for whatever funding they can
 
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:27.980 align:start position:0%
find for some very
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
important things like home care which is
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
a it's like a 3.1 percent increase
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
in home care and they were hoping to
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
adjust that figure up somehow but they
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
have no money so they look to represent
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
the McGuires got the sharpest pencil in
 
00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:47.179 align:start position:0%
the room yeah
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
but I think there's some Merit to what
 
00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has said as far
 
00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has said as far
as

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
changing some of that
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
taking the developers out perhaps and
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
putting municipalities and maybe
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
bringing the amount of money down but
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yeah I especially
 
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.430 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yeah I especially
like

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
ending the duplicative nature of these
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
two programs because as we heard can
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
somebody apply for both yes right I mean
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative I like to know
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
um so the governor wants to put 30
 
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:28.340 align:start position:0%
million into the invest in New Hampshire
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
up to now all the money for that program
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
has come from arpa so what are they
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
getting from arpa this year do we know
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
that I don't think anything nothing so
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
is that why he's so adamant about
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
putting the 30 million in there that
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be my assumption but yeah because
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to assume okay so
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
being that we know you know how tight
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
this budget is uh is it reasonable for
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
us to maybe give him some but reduce
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
this amount
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
that would just speaking for myself that
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
would be my suggestion because that's
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
 
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.110 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
Griffin

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of Apple money
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to run out
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't see how we're going to
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
continue every program
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
that has been surviving on optim money I
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna have to be real
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
careful about that
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
so yeah reduce it
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
I do think we heard from the
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner commissioner Caswell that
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
the alpha money has to be spent within a
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
year or two so perhaps there's some
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
remaining funds that could be sent to
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
invest in each I don't know like again I
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
hate to suggest her
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Sweeney I'd like to
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
ask my friend from Rochester would you
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
be okay with cutting investment age down
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
from 30 million to 10 million and
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
cutting the affordable housing fund from
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
25 to 20 million so it's still a 25
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
million reduction but it's mainly on
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
invest in h and the affordable housing
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
gets 20 of the 25 million
 
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the play honesty
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
all right so that we have a couple of
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
numbers flying around representative
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
Sweeney would like to put something down
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll I'll stick with the initial 15
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
million for both reducing invest in h by
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
15 and reducing affordable housing by 10
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
and striking from invest in h the loans
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
to developers that were that's in the
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
hp2 language just making it grants to
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities I'm happy to write that
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
all up and get an actual
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment if needed but uh Melissa is
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you to get that
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
language to change
 
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:07.460 align:start position:0%
sections uh well
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
43-48 would affect those sections I
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
would second that motion
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
all right is there more discussion on
 
00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.349 align:start position:0%
all right is there more discussion on
that

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
I know what is in your caucus too it's
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary uh really high priority
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
in our caucus and I mean absolutely no
 
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:36.020 align:start position:0%
disrespect on your efforts or anything
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
but I will likely vote no on the motion
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
all right any further
 
00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:50.950 align:start position:0%
all right any further
discussions

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
I suppose the clerk yeah we'll have a
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
vote on this because it'll be a written
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
remind me what sections
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
well it starts at 43 as far as a
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
subdivision for invest in age and
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
travels down through 48.
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
even though those are effective dates
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
which probably won't change so it's uh
 
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.810 align:start position:0%
which probably won't change so it's uh
moved

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
do you mind just repeating it um
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
is it 15 million and 15 million 15
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
million okay so it's 15 million and 15
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
and then removing the availability for
 
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
and then removing the availability for
mute

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
mute
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
all right are we all clear in the
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
language seeing that we are any loans
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
right this this will become strictly
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
granted oh I'm sorry okay sorry so yeah
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
this is just so investment would just be
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
grants to municipalities okay remove
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
developers entirely and it's just going
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
to be grants to municipalities is that
 
00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin yes
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative Campbells yes
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
grassy no
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be good yeah
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
can we have wait for Marty and be here
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
in 10 minutes
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
well I did tell the folks that were here
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
from the fire department and elsewhere
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we'd make a decision tomorrow oh so
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
you'd rather have them tomorrow but I'd
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
like to hear what he said yeah he can
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
certainly see yeah
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
just to talk about it so we really
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
understand that yeah Etc right yeah yeah
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
just as long as we're clear we're not
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to be voting on anything right
 
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.050 align:start position:0%
going to be voting on anything right
right

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:56.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
so doesn't this just look like some name
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
changes updating
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
oh it's yes it's spending they're giving
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
it would go from a Workforce Development
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
coordinator to a director
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
I mean I personally have no problem with
 
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
this considering the workforce situation
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
do we have a cost
 
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:43.609 align:start position:0%
do we have a cost
um

00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.060 align:start position:0%
I think on the table Charlie gave us
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
the memory
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
I would expect that salary difference
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
would be 20 000 or less Okay we okay to
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
279

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
279
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe we talked about this with
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
attitude

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:47.099 align:start position:0%
this has to do with distribution
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
yeah what the victims get
 
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.329 align:start position:0%
yeah what the victims get
um

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
from the assistance fund
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
maybe this was to pay for the extra
 
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.650 align:start position:0%
maybe this was to pay for the extra
person

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.329 align:start position:0%
person
who

00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
remember there was that extra person
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
we just approved something
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
did we approve that guy we did it first
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
take the questions had to do it
 
00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:37.630 align:start position:0%
take the questions had to do it
costs

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay thoughts
 
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.589 align:start position:0%
okay thoughts
um

00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.730 align:start position:0%
 
years

00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
it could reduce the amount of money
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
received by the victims technically I
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
suppose but
 
00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:07.970 align:start position:0%
suppose but
so

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
just because it says 30 it doesn't mean
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
they'll spend 30 percent I bet the 15
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
they were butting up against the ceiling
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
and they just needed more latitude I
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
can't imagine they wouldn't do their
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
utmost to get the most good to the
 
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.550 align:start position:0%
utmost to get the most good to the
victims

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
according to this they are spending 30
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bottom figure
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
all right so representative Griffin
 
00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:49.940 align:start position:0%
moves this you okay with this yeah
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
all right just to show a handson
 
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:55.820 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
so we did 80 281
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGuire look where we
 
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
we did 281 yeah
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
oh professional life should we do your
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
first yeah so we got you got from Carol
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the two other sections they wanted to
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.890 align:start position:0%
the two other sections they wanted to
keep

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.770 align:start position:0%
keep
yes

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:25.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
so we hopefully will have that Amendment
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire do you have your
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to yeah
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
I want to see here
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
I saw your notes but so the these are my
 
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.849 align:start position:0%
I saw your notes but so the these are my
notes

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
these are my numbers yes for that
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
section right so so for every section
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
there's a note here about keep or not
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
keep and then there's not that many
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
keeps it's mostly removed yeah
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay right so this this amendment
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
is remove everything okay okay and and
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have another amendment much smaller
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
there well not smaller than this but I
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
mean small smaller than yeah smaller
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
than the original pages that you know
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
put back a few things and our basic
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
criteria of putting back is if no one
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
has complained about it
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
if it's not trivial so there's there's a
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
few things that are just clean up but
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
they don't hurt anything not being
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
cleaned up until next year so we took
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
those out
 
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.069 align:start position:0%
those out
um

00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
but all the transfers essentially
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
um most of the transfers we're keeping
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
in with the one exception being the
 
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.089 align:start position:0%
in with the one exception being the
interpreters

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
interpreters
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
um which are now transferred meaning
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said I don't want
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
this put it back to give it to OLS no
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
BLC yeah yeah there's like four of them
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the auctioneers the boxing
 
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.250 align:start position:0%
the the auctioneers the boxing
um

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:09.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
you know and then it also removes
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think three of the small ones the
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendors the Hawkers and
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
Peddlers and the athlete agents now the
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
athlete agents that was a bill that was
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
itl'd in the house or wasn't it no it
 
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:26.660 align:start position:0%
was the Senate
 
00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:29.900 align:start position:0%
passed the house and didn't uh
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
so it was a house position
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
not this year obviously but yeah you
 
00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:36.349 align:start position:0%
not this year obviously but yeah you
know

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and then there were a couple of
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
um cleanup type things
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
from past house bills past things so so
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
in the past some things have been moved
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
into oplc but the but the rest of the
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
law didn't catch up quite right and so
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
there's a few fixed is that 655
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
is that the First Amendment we saw kind
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
of yeah but but but
 
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
um the assessing certification board
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
had a few fixes the Allied Health Board
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
had some fixes in that area
 
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.930 align:start position:0%
had some fixes in that area
um

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
the the manufactured housing something
 
00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:19.339 align:start position:0%
or other board
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's a couple like that
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
um which are really just clean up
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
they're not well they're clean up and
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
and in a couple of cases the board is
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
going from like seven people to five and
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
I think the governor wanted to do some
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
of those things because he has to
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
appoint all seven people and they have a
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
hard time finding them so we we
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
um there's just a few of those that we
 
00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.690 align:start position:0%
um there's just a few of those that we
left

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
well do you have an amendment for your
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
suggestions the ones that you want to
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
look back well we Melissa's working on
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
yeah but I could read you what it is if
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
you want oh a representative Sweeney
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
first yeah my only question
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see a list of the licenses
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're essentially pulling out because I
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand this amendment strikes out
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
everything and then we'll restore the
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
licensing we're phasing out
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
to me the
 
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take we're we're
 
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to keep the licensing for any
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
thing that anyone's complained about I
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
don't know if that that doesn't sit
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
right with me because people can
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
complain about everything we do and if
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
we just you know I understand didn't do
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
it because we got one email so I I just
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
want to be able to fully review
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
ever so more than sorry but more than
 
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.829 align:start position:0%
ever so more than sorry but more than
yes

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
exactly right like I want us from the
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
beginning right and tomorrow you'll see
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
the one that has the the reason I'm
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
writing it that way is so that the thing
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
you'll see tomorrow is the things that
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
are in yeah as opposed to saying remove
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
this remove this remove this and we're
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to be flipping through and saying
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
oh we didn't remove that you know what I
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's like
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
we don't I'm sorry Mr chair no I was
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
just going to say to representative
 
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:10.700 align:start position:0%
Sweeney's Point we've heard from the
 
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists this summer in favor in
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
summer of homes right you know so
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
um yeah but you know when it comes to
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
forestry soil scientists all right
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
electoral paths you know they've all
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
seem to be opposed so so let me say some
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
well all right you're probably yeah let
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin Golf yeah but
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of groups that in the
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that we all sat through Monday
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
last Monday
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of groups that that are
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
being removed there that nobody got up
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
and complained about
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
and yes and some of those are you know
 
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
and by white and you know we all get
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
emails and phone calls and everything
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me like most of the
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
activity is
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
limited to several small you know
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
several not small groups but several
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
active groups and I thought Edna did a
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
super super job and I don't understand
 
00:49:13.319 --> 00:49:14.809 align:start position:0%
super super job and I don't understand
why

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't take any DNA's recommendations
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
and amend
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
amend hb2 based on Edna's
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations this this approach is
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
just wiping everything out and then
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
trying to put
 
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.270 align:start position:0%
trying to put
so

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
the thing is
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
what we're running into is
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
we can't in one day become experts in
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
this area right and and even though Edna
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
did go through it in detail they still
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity via retained bills
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
and bills next year and so on to do a
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff right
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the the the the the issue is and I
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
think it's just
 
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
um as our chairman said we're getting
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
inundated with complaints we can't make
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
an intelligent decision on this
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
complaint versus that complaint for you
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
know and so on I will say just in
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
general so
 
00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:21.650 align:start position:0%
general so
um

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
because you know my wife has been
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
on this committee for 12 of the last 14
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
years and
 
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:30.829 align:start position:0%
years and
um

00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing is it is an area
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does not do that well
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
I mean we have a fantastic legislature
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
and all this sort of stuff but but we
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
say yes to a lot of things there's
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's a license for example on this
 
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.309 align:start position:0%
there's a license for example on this
list

00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that only us and Illinois license
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
as a reaction to one case in Exeter that
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
the license wouldn't have fixed anyways
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
Etc right and so but but there's plenty
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
of other cases right Foresters Maybe
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
less than 20 States license them Etc and
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
we do we have a lot of Licensing and and
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
it tends to be because we have
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
non-professional people in our
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
legislature and and for example
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects right we have
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects licensed because it
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
was done by Chuck Morse in 2005 he's in
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
the landscape business he wanted to be
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
licensed right or he wanted friends of
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
his to be licensed or whatever right and
 
00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.770 align:start position:0%
his to be licensed or whatever right and
so

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
and and the same sort of thing I've
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
heard the same thing about why this
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
profession was licensed because because
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
one of those was in the legislature and
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
we you know people come to us and we
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
tend to say yes right so in general what
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
you learn in this area is the people who
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
do the work want to be licensed right
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's true because it it's a Restraint
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
of competition all right
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
um there's plenty of studies you know
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
where they say for example you study
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
areas where
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
so for example dentists dentists are
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
licensed everywhere right but there's
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
some places where if you're a dentist
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
you can move to that place and be a
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
dentist with no trouble and there's
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
other places where you move to that
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
place and you got to pass a test and
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
take take this class and do this other
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
stuff and it's complicated and there's
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
some and there are studies that say
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
Dentistry costs 10 percent more in the
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
second kind of place compared to the
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
first kind of place right so the the it
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
costs us a lot of money to license all
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
these things okay so all the complaints
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard are not from people who say
 
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.549 align:start position:0%
we've heard are not from people who say
um

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
this board you know I had a problem and
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
this board fixed it for me therefore you
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
should keep this board they're all from
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
people who say don't get rid of my board
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know I want to be licensed and so
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's what you know that's just the
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
characteristic of this of this um field
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's way too much to dump
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
on this committee at the last minute and
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
try to you know make sense of it so
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're trying to cut it down to just all
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
the super super non-controversial stuff
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
and you know we'll we'll bring these
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
things up again next time that's all I
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
think representative McGuire has made
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
some good points because one of the
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
things that stuck out in my mind last
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
Friday is when representative Ebel asked
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
the executive director had she talked to
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
anybody any of the agencies affected by
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
these changes and the answer was no so
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
that concerned me that people really
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
haven't been thoroughly involved that
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to be affected by the
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
changes in this uh the old PLC and I
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
think representative McGuire
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting we remove things the entire
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
section and then put back the things
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
that we know haven't been terribly
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
controversial and apparently this is
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
your list representative McGuire yes
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
okay and and they're made and there were
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
two more I think from apparel today or
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
they are here Physical Therapy yeah okay
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes all right so these are the notes
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
sorry let me turn this up so these are
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
the notes of the things to retain okay
 
00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:42.829 align:start position:0%
the notes of the things to retain okay
um

00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
so the first one is the assessing
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
certification board fixes something
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
there was a bill last year that didn't
 
00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:52.099 align:start position:0%
fully make the changes it wanted to make
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
athlete agents were just removing them
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
00:54:57.119 --> 00:54:57.770 align:start position:0%
simply because
um

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
no one's complained about it there's
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
only about three or four of them total
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
in the state very few States license
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
this area so yeah absolutely sorry
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
so on athlete agents what I had seen was
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that was going to
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
remove the license it was itl then Edna
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
then they were talking about converting
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
it into a study committee and then they
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
decided because it was covid they
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
forward with it so there really hadn't
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
been a determination one way or the
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
other did something happen after that in
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
no I thought it was the other way around
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
it passed the house in the past and then
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
the Senate killed it well what I saw was
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that it was in Tony Lucas had
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
said so
 
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.690 align:start position:0%
said so
the

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:49.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
issue there here is that I mean we can
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
straighten this out but because
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
because athlete agents are repealed in
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 there is a board associated with it
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
it is under the Secretary of State's
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
purview and so it's not indicated to be
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
transferred so one thing I thought is if
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
if it's correct that
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
um the athlete agent thing is hasn't
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
been repealed by anybody either side
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
maybe at least we could move the board
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State to oplc yeah
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's really can't be much of a board
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
when there's only no no you know I
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
understand so my and then my other
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
question and I don't think it is a board
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's just that it's just the
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
certification kind of thing right you
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
pay a fee and say I've you know maybe we
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
can check that out but that leads me to
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
my next question is are there any boards
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
that we are leaving behind for some
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
reason that should be transferred
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
yes and no so the one board that is
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
listed to be transferred is the
 
00:56:59.579 --> 00:57:01.010 align:start position:0%
listed to be transferred is the
interpreters

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
interpreters
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
from their their administratively
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
attached to education the Department of
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
Education and I think Carol decided
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
to leave them alone for now
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
so that one could be transferred and was
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the original House Bill 2 but for
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the Carol decided not to
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
move them
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
so why don't we just start right at the
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
top okay
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
so but athlete agents is really getting
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
removed so there would no longer be a
 
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:36.500 align:start position:0%
license for an athlete age
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
unless we Loop unless we restore it or
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah I don't I don't know if
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt but I was
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
just Mr Hoffman I have a bill number I
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
can give you and maybe we can track the
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislative history of athlete agents
 
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:54.020 align:start position:0%
and figure that out
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
auctioneers this is a move from the
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to oplc
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
so Allied health professionals
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
right now there's there's a couple of
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
there's like physical therapists and
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
speech therapists and a few other
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
similar things that are under a board
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
called Allied health professionals and
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
that board was moved to oplc so there's
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
like an extra layer there that's not
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
really necessary the boards are still
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
there but now there's the Allied Health
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
professional board and now there's lplc
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
so it could be just so what this does is
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
it just makes those individual boards in
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
lplc without the Allied Health
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
professional board if you see what I
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
mean so so that's what this is doing so
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
tell us what who comes under the Allied
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
Health profession there's like five of
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
them and I know for sure it's physical
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
therapists and there's there's a few
 
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.270 align:start position:0%
therapists and there's there's a few
others

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
it was in this um handout that
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
director Courtney gave us
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
see this one in this big colorful thing
 
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:27.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
so it's this page Allied Health
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
governing board
 
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:37.250 align:start position:0%
governing board
um

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:39.410 align:start position:0%
um
16.

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
16.
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
um one board to implement procedural
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
rules for right
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
it existed but now oplc has the
 
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.490 align:start position:0%
it existed but now oplc has the
authority

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:51.500 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't even list
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
so this board that we're that's getting
 
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
rid of this layer doesn't itself issue
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
any licenses it was just kind of the
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
oplc for those other boards if you see
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
what I mean so that's that's that one
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
um but if you really want to know let's
 
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:10.940 align:start position:0%
look at page
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
112 Maybe
 
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.690 align:start position:0%
112 Maybe
yep

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
allies health professional here we go
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay athletic trainers occupational
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
therapists physical therapists speech
 
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:32.420 align:start position:0%
language pathologist and hearing care
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
providers and genetic counselors so
 
01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
all of them have their own boards
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
they're still staying they're still
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
licensed it's just that there's no
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
extra layer on top of them okay because
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's it's important for Medicare
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that they have to be
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate a redundant regulatory
 
01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:07.130 align:start position:0%
eliminate a redundant regulatory
framework

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that one
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
um boxing and wrestling moved from so
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State he had no trouble
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
 
01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:17.289 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
um

01:01:17.289 --> 01:01:17.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
electricians it's just a tiny cleanup
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it allows if you're if in if you've
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
got experience in the military being an
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
electrician that can count towards your
 
01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:29.569 align:start position:0%
electrician that can count towards your
experience

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
when when you're you know to be licensed
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
so that's what that one is
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
um genetic counselors that's part of
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
this Allied Health thing Hawkers and
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
Peddlers it's currently with the
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State get rid of it Dan
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
tell us what I'm sorry represent where
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
tell us what a genetic counselor does I
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
they're they're a member of the uh of
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
the Allied Health I'm not going to
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
answer this one here but I did have a
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
comment or a question on the the Hawkers
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
and Peddlers yes and I want to I
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
understand it's something you're
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
I I mentioned this at the last meeting
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
we had I don't know if you were here or
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
not but as a city councilor I had an
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have to work on a city
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
ordinance for Hawkers and Peddlers
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
because we were having concerns about
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
them in our community and one of the
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
things is is that the the people that
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
came in before our committee said that
 
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
well why should we have to get a license
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
here in Rochester and then have to go to
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and get a license and then
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
go to Barrington get a license then go
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
to Dover and get a license
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
when I can just get a license in the
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
state we looked at him and said you can
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
get a license from the state and he said
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah and we said well go get a license
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the state and then you're covered
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
everywhere in in the state by
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
eliminating this what it's going to
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
require now is that each individual
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
Community have their own Hockers and
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
Battlers licenses requirements and
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to get a license in
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
every Community they go to whereas if
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and has one license
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
they just go wherever they want in the
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they're all
 
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.770 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they're all
set

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
and that's what the concern I have is
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
that we're now going to require that
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to get how many
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
communities do we have in New Hampshire
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
you don't have to get that many licenses
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
all right instead of just one so I would
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
be that's something I'm very concerned
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
about I would like to you know maybe
 
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
take some time to be able to talk to my
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
my code enforcement officer and see what
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
their requirements are now and if
 
01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:17.339 align:start position:0%
something has changed since that because
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then and then the next one is the
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
same I I tender and vendors
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative cambrells I know this is
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a on you no that's a good point
 
01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
I mean uh I was hoping that when they
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
remove it from the state that the that
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the towns would not have a hawker
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
Veteran's license after that either
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
because the RSA is removed most of the
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
towns use the same RSA I believe to do
 
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
the hawkrum Peddler's license so killing
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
it here should kill it in all the towns
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding and that's
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
what I would want because I faced that
 
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:54.740 align:start position:0%
situation now I run uh charity Raffles
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
and when I'm in Boston I got to go to
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
Boston if we're having the meeting in
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
London I got to go to Loudoun it's and
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's CLI and I gotta always remember
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
what town I'm in when we do the drawing
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
for these Raffles because if not I I'm
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
in violation and uh and it's ridiculous
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
especially for these charitable events
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
to have to pay thirty dollars every time
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
for our license that's what you have to
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
pay each town so my understanding was if
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
we kill the RSA
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
the towns have nothing to hang their hat
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
on this is RSA 320 and 321. yeah are we
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
killing the RSA that's the thing and so
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's okay yeah okay so but let's see
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
here so correct again correct me if I'm
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
wrong but I thought I could then go to
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
my town and say hey this has been killed
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of your paperwork because all
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
your paperwork references that RSA and
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
it'll no longer exist all right let me
 
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
so representative Cambridge do you have
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
any idea I don't
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
um why this law came into place was it
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
to try to control people that were out
 
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:02.540 align:start position:0%
pedaling and talking their goods
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
by my understanding and you probably
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a good understanding to
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative grass he was you know you
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
get a lot of transients to come through
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
and they would set off shops to do
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
certain things and uh to sell certain
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
Wares and then the the cheat people and
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
they'd leave town and and again I don't
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
know at least this made them go through
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the motion of applying for a uh a
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
license to do it and it may have just
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
been a revenue you know stream Creator
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
but I'll defer it to representative
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
grass yeah the experience we had is that
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
people were coming to town that you know
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
many times and occasionally criminal
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
records and they were there scamming
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
people I mean you used to have a lot of
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
door-to-door salesmen that were out all
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
over the place particularly magazine
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
people would come in sell subscriptions
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
and descriptions would never show up and
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
or sell books that weren't what they
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
said they were going to be and so by
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
doing it this way we were able to get
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
rid of scammers in some sense that you
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
know if somebody was out there selling
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
we could pick them up and if they didn't
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
have a Hawkers and Peddler's license
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
where they were had been checked by
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
someone in the state then they were in
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
violation and we could boot them out of
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
town or you know find them and put them
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
out of town and but you know that was
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things my committee said you
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
know if somebody's checked you we don't
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
have to check you a second time one
 
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
license for the entire state would have
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
been the best thing to do then as you're
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying have to pay in each individual
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
town that was kind of ridiculous and I
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if you're
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to be removing this that it
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't give the opportunity for
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
communities to still do that because
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
some communities will say you're still
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
going to need a Hawkers and Peddler's
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
license so that we make sure that it's
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be and I think you know so
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
at least people are checked for criminal
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
backgrounds right as well so the answer
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
is this does not affect the power of
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
towns as far as I can tell this is
 
01:06:50.809 --> 01:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
simply moving what the state does in
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:53.210 align:start position:0%
this area
um

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
so uh so you still could
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
require 50 100 and how many rounds are
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
there different licenses so this doesn't
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
solve your problem in fact I think it
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
makes it even worse okay so are you sure
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
that the town wouldn't wouldn't double
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
dip and not only require the state
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
license but the town license we didn't I
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
don't know what other towns have done
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
but we've said if you've got a Hawkins
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
met the requirements yeah so if we
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to do what you described there is
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
a part here
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
um there there is a line you could
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
remove here that only to make it only a
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
state license and not a town license
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
right but again maybe that's better as
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
another bill okay that's what I was just
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe it's better as another
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill and that I would be happy to work
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
with you on this to get it straightened
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
out for next for next year do you recall
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
what the cost of the license at the
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
state level is I don't
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
um well the main thing is you've got to
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
have a surety bond
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
okay so the annual license fee renewal
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
is fifty dollar fifty dollars a year
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
plus a surety bond and they've never
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
they've never had an experience where
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
the surety bond was needed so you know I
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot there yeah
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the point as far as this
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
whole exercise is we're finding things
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we could have let's say unknown
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
consequences unintended consequences
 
01:08:14.819 --> 01:08:19.070 align:start position:0%
consequences unintended consequences
okay

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
um mechanical licensing board there was
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
a just a very minor
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
cleanup section that's still going to be
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
a board Etc same with departments but
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
this repeals the State Board of Fire
 
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.689 align:start position:0%
this repeals the State Board of Fire
Control

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:31.699 align:start position:0%
Control
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
on section 430.
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
section 430 page 154 and I don't know
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
much about it but it does repeal a board
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't know much about
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I'd like to make
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
a general comment
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
we're in over our heads here right yeah
 
01:09:01.799 --> 01:09:05.150 align:start position:0%
we're in over our heads here right yeah
yeah

01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
no you know the governor
 
01:09:09.249 --> 01:09:09.259 align:start position:0%
the government
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
created a budget he's a piece of State
 
01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.269 align:start position:0%
created a budget he's a piece of State
executive

01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh agile
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
our job is to see whether the funds are
 
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.169 align:start position:0%
our job is to see whether the funds are
there

01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:21.179 --> 01:09:22.249 align:start position:0%
there
to

01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.450 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
to make the budget work and now we're
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
all these licensing things and and
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
they're really policy things and I think
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
we did the right thing when we when we
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
sent the thing to uh Edna and they
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
certainly addressed
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of the groups that had the
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
Elijah's feedback on the governor's
 
01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:50.990 align:start position:0%
Elijah's feedback on the governor's
proposal

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
proposal
but

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
now we're down yeah and now we're down
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
looking at every line of it
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
against the tight deadline
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
and my fear is that
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
we we don't know what we're doing in
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to make it we're
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to make it worse and I think
 
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's probably why representative
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I where we spoke
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
over the weekend thought it might be
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
advisable to just delete these sections
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
and whatever Edna as you suggested
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
because they had an amendment as you
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
recall to put this stuff back on House
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 I think it was and there were
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
some other things that were very minor
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State said he'd
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
like to give up but anything else where
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
we venture could be very problematic in
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
my opinion and again we're not the
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
but this is in our laps because it's a
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 issue that we have to deal
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
with representative Griffin follow-up
 
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.050 align:start position:0%
with representative Griffin follow-up
well

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
well
yeah

01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna own this
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
yeah and we shouldn't own it the
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
governor should own it the policy
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee should own it
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
and we're going to own it yeah if we can
 
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
do something and we're not really
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
equipped to deal with it in the short
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
period of time no that we're looking at
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
represent grassy I I think the one
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
comment about that is that when we had
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the director of the department that's
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to be doing all these licenses and
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
she was asked a direct question of did
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
you talk to anybody about these things
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
and in most cases the answer was no so I
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
think the governor just threw a bunch of
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
stuff in here figuring that we'd figure
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
it out and I think that was the intent
 
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
because what we're finding is is by
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
removing some of these licenses and you
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
know just
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
you know just cob lunches take the whole
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
thing is we got significant problems
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
here and by doing this we're probably
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
creating more problems than solving
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
problems so I wouldn't say the governor
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
had all the answers on these things as
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
well I think was just put all the
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
in there and we'll take it out you know
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
let somebody else take it out
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
well let me represent talk about this
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
particular section of evil okay what I
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
was I just want to say that I did ask
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative Carol Maguire if Edna had
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
gotten through the whole bill and she
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
said no and she was only able to
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
represent a couple of things that the
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee had done so to say that
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
they've actually reviewed it I they
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have an opera theirs jammed up I
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
think as we are so they did the best
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
they could do Under the time so we don't
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
really have their blessing at all
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
well I don't think that's true for one
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
thing oh really oh I thought it was okay
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
all right but secondly on this
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board this is this
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
board was already moved into oplc and
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
this particular section when there were
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
is a cleanup that should have been done
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
at the time and wasn't so that saying
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
these are all things it's not getting
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
rid of the board it's it's getting rid
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
of it's telling the board you don't do
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
things that oplc does for you
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
right so these are all normal things
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
that oplc does for boards that are part
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
of them and so that's what that's what
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
those repeals are it's not repealing the
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
board or anything like that it is though
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
reducing the size of the board slightly
 
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.890 align:start position:0%
reducing the size of the board slightly
from

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:25.900 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
from
[Music]

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
anyways there's there's a there's a
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
reduction in the in the board it in oh
 
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.930 align:start position:0%
reduction in the in the board it in oh
yeah

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
from from two two gas Fitters to one you
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing so there's
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of changes in the in
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
the composition of the board and I think
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's likely because
 
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh and and also
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
this requires that the board hold eight
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
meetings a year well
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and and it has a quorum of four
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
members so that stuff is being crossed
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
out so they can meet it's actually how
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
long they how often they want to be
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
rather than by law they have to have
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
eight meetings you see what I mean
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
because these boards frequently they're
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
so small they don't have much work to do
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
especially when they're part of oplc so
 
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.830 align:start position:0%
especially when they're part of oplc so
therefore

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
um they want to meet less often than the
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
current law tells them they have to meet
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean so that's what
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's the this is what we would call
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
cleanup right it's
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's still aboard they still make their
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
own rules they still license people
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's license is changing all that
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's it's changing
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
that they have to be there with a quorum
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
that they have to have so many meetings
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so did
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of Edna so the rather the
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
whole committee they make a
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this or is this
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
um on this particular line I don't know
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I I do think they did go through as a
 
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.410 align:start position:0%
um I I do think they did go through as a
committee

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
the whole bill and look for the
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
highlights but you know on this
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
particular line section this is such a
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
minor section from their point of view
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
I know Carol read this line by line
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
whether the rest of them did I don't
 
01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
whether the rest of them did I don't
know

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
know
yeah

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
so um and you noticed um you know Jackie
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
grota she's been very has has looked at
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
it in a lot of detail and had certain
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
specific problems right so anyway but
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
but you can see this particular section
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
right yeah there's nothing here right
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
except making things a little easier for
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
this particular board
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
a representative Griffin I think it's
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
made of a very good point that you know
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
we could to do this thoroughly add to
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
his comments to do this thoroughly if we
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
were the policy committee it would
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
probably take us weeks at least a couple
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
of days really because we finally met
 
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:14.300 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
Edna folks on Friday and we're still
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
wrestling with
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
you know minor things but I think
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
when I like hopefully to see done after
 
01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:26.209 align:start position:0%
when I like hopefully to see done after
uh

01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
I get done with listening to
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt but
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
I think this needs way too much work for
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
us to you don't have to vote for
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything other than 107. yeah and there
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
may be some you know some small things
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
like again the amendment that they put
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
forward on Friday that we could
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
certainly incorporate it but going down
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
and saying you know what uh the pharmacy
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
board should be even though they're
 
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
so-called technical cleanups
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
look at it I have you know I'm not I
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the pharmacy Lisa so I can't
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
tell you what if that's a technical
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
cleanup or not but representative Hewitt
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
I agree that we're in over our heads
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.370 align:start position:0%
I've been
my

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
email box
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
looks like it's been hit by a tornado
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I've heard from
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of people mostly in the
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
medical profession because I have a lot
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
of contacts there
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking as I was looking at
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
we were talking about here
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
I just picked a place to look for one of
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
these boards and I looked at a place
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
every applicant for initial permanent
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
licensure or reinstatement shall submit
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine no the office
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
of professional licensurement
 
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.090 align:start position:0%
of professional licensurement
certification

01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
and the office of a professional
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
licensure certification has a lot of a
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
lot of boards and things that we're
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
trying to save
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
the trouble is unless there's something
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
here that I can't find and if I can't
 
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
find it I'm not going to vote for her I
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee you that
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
I can't find
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
where the office of professional
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
licensure has
 
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.450 align:start position:0%
licensure has
members

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
who are involved in some degree
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
in the boards and so forth that they are
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
taken care of in Terms of licensure
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
I don't mind them having having the
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
authority to to
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
look at complaints and and
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
letters that they get but to to put them
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the trail
 
01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:09.470 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the trail
right

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I I didn't pick a lot of Physicians
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
and surgeons I ran across it okay
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
and right so that's a section that is
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
not we're not contemplating leaving that
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
particular section
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
from here right so you're looking at
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
section 437 right right this is the this
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
is the page that shows you the things
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
we're considering leaving
 
01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:39.860 align:start position:0%
it stops at 4 30 and starts again at
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
484. so 437 is not there okay do you see
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
what I mean yeah all right the the oplc
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
is an organization with
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
um currently 83 employees about to
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
become 89.
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
so there's lots and lots of people there
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
including attorneys and all that other
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
stuff that do all of the they're the
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
staff for all these boards right
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
and they do the work for all these
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
boards the boards are the the management
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
they they figure out what they want to
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
do with their group
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
but oplc is the ones who actually take
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the hundred dollars and give you your
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
license and they check that you're
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
qualified and all that sort of stuff
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right we need to really move along
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
or representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
chairman before we we vote on any of
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
these proposals
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps tomorrow after we continue our
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
recess from tonight uh for our meeting
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps the other representative McGuire
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
maybe the governor's budget or policy
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
director can come here and we can talk
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit more sure okay
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
because we're not we're not going to
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
make a decision on any of this tonight
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
at least that's my hope yeah there's a
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
lot since I have to leave you know we
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
have uh yeah we have
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
um very little left except this
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
particular section oplc we've gotten
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
very soon and that's why Marty is here
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
yeah 436 so we'll turn over to Marty
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
because we've got to make it we don't
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision tomorrow on
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
those two bills but we should but Marty
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah can I just ask a process question
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
so say representative McGuire brings in
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment we don't like the amendment
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
we make changes I mean we have to be
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
done tomorrow so if we don't like the
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
amendment we make changes and then we
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
just basically have to wait until those
 
01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:49.460 align:start position:0%
changes are made and embodied in another
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment for us to approve or how does
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
that work
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
back up say that again okay so what if
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
he what if representative McGuire brings
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
in an amendment that has all these
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
changes yeah tomorrow and we don't
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
approve his Amendment but there are
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
certain things we would like about his
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment would it go back to OLS and
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
redo it and then we'd have to approve
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
the Amendments tomorrow night or it's
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
just process I just wondered how it
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
works well if representative McGuire
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
comes in with an amendment we'll vote it
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
up or down and if someone else would
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
like to offer another amendment with the
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
things they like we can vote that up or
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
down yeah but if I don't if we didn't
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
have it in our hands okay well they can
 
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
get stuff to us and then we can actually
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
later but they would really like us done
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow right we still have technically
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
till like Friday so we could even get
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
together and vote Melissa we're just
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to say because they're committed
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
votes you can vote without having the
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you we've done
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
that a few times on other bills we vote
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
as a committee of what you would like us
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
to see then we go and draft work with
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
OLS to get it drafted to bring it back
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee but you don't have to
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
take another vote you can just vote on
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
what you expect the language to be okay
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
because they will see it we'll see the
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
final language and then we'll send it to
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
you but we've done that a couple of
 
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.310 align:start position:0%
you but we've done that a couple of
times

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
for further clarify this and I'm
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
familiar haven't done this it's been a
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
long time but amending bills amendments
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
that come to into committee and making
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
some changes to I think what
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has done here is
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
admirable and it's certainly something I
 
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
can support and you know the Hawkers and
 
01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
Peddlers saying is something I have a
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
question about but if you're willing to
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
take the unintended consequences but the
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
thing is could we change
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
like maybe take one out or add one in
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when we're doing it and then
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
have them draft that Amendment that's my
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
understanding the way it can be done so
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
we can basically use his his draft his
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
his Amendment as the basis and then we
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
give it to the LBA and work that out
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
after we mark it up I think that's
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's great because I'll tell you it's
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty satisfactory to me so
 
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
all right representative Griffin are you
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
all okay over there yeah
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I just say one thing when I left
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon after that hearing it
 
01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon after that hearing it
Edna

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
right I thought well they have addressed
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
virtually every issue
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
that was in contention by any number of
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
people on Monday and they certainly
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
addressed most of the emails
 
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
the the issues they addressed were the
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
ones that resulted in most of the emails
 
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.050 align:start position:0%
ones that resulted in most of the emails
and

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:32.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that we were going to
 
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:36.380 align:start position:0%
come in this morning
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
okay let's adopt
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
e-dnas proposed amendments
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
on these areas that are in contention
 
01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.530 align:start position:0%
on these areas that are in contention
and

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.810 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
be done with it now that's kind of a
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
simplified approach obviously there
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
because we all know that there's a lot
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
in that bill there's a lot in that bill
 
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.450 align:start position:0%
in that bill there's a lot in that bill
but

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
to try and scrap the bill and start over
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
then we own it and I don't think I don't
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
think we're qualified on it we're not
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
the executive branch we're getting into
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
their area we're not a policy
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee where finance committee
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
and if if we concentrate on the million
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
dollars of fees we're going to lose
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's our job see we're going to lose
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the oplc language in those
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
250 somewhat sections we're going to
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
lose about nine hundred thousand dollars
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
right and and presumably it's going to
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
be half a million dollars the savings or
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
something five to six hundred thousand
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
of savings all right but they'll still
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
be self-funding but now we're getting
 
01:25:59.699 --> 01:26:00.970 align:start position:0%
be self-funding but now we're getting
into

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:00.980 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:04.139 align:start position:0%
wow like we're we're gonna run we're
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
gonna run the state
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think that side job I think I
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
should obviously I should point out I
 
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
mean when when these things come up to
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
the floor you vote on them you know I
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
mean we're going to have to ultimately
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
you do vote on these we're gonna have to
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
defend whatever comes out of here first
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
before the division right then for the
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
full committee and then the house and as
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
I told Dan on Friday
 
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
I cannot support the sections with oplc
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
the way it is now I just can't and I
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
won't and I've always if I don't feel
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
comfortable about something I remember
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
years ago as a kid when I was an intern
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
in DC listening to a United States
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
Senator said I don't feel good about it
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
so I vote no and if you don't feel good
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
about something you have you got to vote
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
no and I think anything that comes out
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
of here we have to feel good about it
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
support it as best we can and there'll
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
be some compromise perhaps even with
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
this oplc thing like with the Hawker and
 
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
Catalyst that we don't all agree on but
 
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
I think it needs probably a clean slate
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
as representative McGuire has put
 
01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
forward and then we can I hate to use
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the word Jerry pick and we can Jerry
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
pick the things that aren't
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
controversial and what Edna told us in
 
01:27:26.689 --> 01:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
that amendment that we saw 655 and make
 
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
those changes but the way this came to
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
us it was you know without saying too
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
much I think it was a little unfair to
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
put so much in for us to review in such
 
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
a short period of time and then rely on
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
e-dna in such a short period of time to
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
get us their recommendations because
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
this is not establishing the department
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
of energy as the executive director said
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
to us Friday this is a lot more than the
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
department of energy was this
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin recalls from
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
being here so
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
we will move on to this tomorrow morning
 
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah Marty sorry to keep you waiting we
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
have a number of questions that we hope
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
you can clear up for us and I'll turn it
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
over to representative McGuire because
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're his amendments yeah so so Marty
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
when I took out sections two and three
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 436 the firefighters
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
beat me up over n Corrections and
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the sense that they say their pension
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
is not based on the five highest years
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
of service but it's somehow based on all
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
years of service under current law and
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
what they want to go back to is three
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
highest years so can you explain that in
 
01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
detail I I can representative I'm gonna
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna take a come in from a higher
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
level and sort of narrow down because it
 
01:28:55.090 --> 01:28:55.100 align:start position:0%
is a lot to unpack here we need that yes
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
so so basically you know average final
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
compensation until 2011 was the highest
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
three years of earnable compensation and
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
our honorable compensation is separately
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
defined in the statute in the next
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
um Roman and A1 and 100 A1
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the chain changes were made in 2011
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
for members who were not vested by one
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
one of twelve it it on the surface it
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
changes from a three year average to a
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
five which is very straightforward and I
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
think everyone understands you know
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
typically a five-year average is going
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit less than a three you
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
know in most cases
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
um there was language
 
01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh put in to that section for these uh
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
non-vested members and future hires uh
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
regarding uh something called
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
compensation over base pay so this was a
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
New Concept that was introduced uh in
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
2011 and what if that's fairly
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory it's like you have a
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
base salary that's which contract says
 
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
you know that's you know if you didn't
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
work any work straight time that's what
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
you get at the end of the year other
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
types of earnable compensation over base
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
uh compensation over base pay would
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
include overtime
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
um uh longevity bonuses
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
um retirement incentives things like
 
01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.430 align:start position:0%
um retirement incentives things like
that

01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
um unused sickened vacation time that's
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
paid out either at the end of your
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
career or during the course of your
 
01:30:16.139 --> 01:30:17.450 align:start position:0%
career or during the course of your
career

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so so some of those pay types were
 
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.870 align:start position:0%
um so so some of those pay types were
excluded

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
um the the unused sickened vacation time
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
were excluded from earnable comp so they
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
don't count so so the way the
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
compensation over base formula works so
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
this is where uh I can see people
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
describing is I don't get my true high
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
five is
 
01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:36.229 align:start position:0%
five is
um

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
when we when that person comes to us to
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
get a retirement estimate or to retire
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to count back
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
from their retirement date and 12-month
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
increments uh backwards and find the
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
highest five years in that scenario
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's the last five or they're
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
non-consecutive or wherever they fall
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
um since um 2011 when the law changed
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
employers have been reporting
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
like two lines for members you know
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
compensation and compensation over base
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what happens is
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the base pay and you know
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't get impacted At All by
 
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't get impacted At All by
this

01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
um what what it does is we find the high
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
five years and then we look at the
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
percentage of compensation over base and
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
the high five as a total percentage of
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
the AFC so if somebody was making fifty
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
thousand as base and they had ten
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
thousand is
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
um you know over time or other
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
compensation over base it's you know ten
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
one ones
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
ten thousand out of sixty thousand
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
dollar totals or whatever that
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
percentage is
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and then what we have to do is a
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
second step and this is where it gets
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
this is actually where it gets confusing
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
um is then we have to look at all of
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
their reported compensation since
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
January 1 of 11. and look at the
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of compensation over base for
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
the entirety of their career since uh
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
one one of twelve correct I'm sorry and
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the percentage is
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
higher in the highest five years we have
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
to apply the lower percentage you know
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
the career percentage in that high five
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
so that could knock down you know the
 
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.610 align:start position:0%
so that could knock down you know the
total

01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
total
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
um you know pensionable wages that go
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
into AFC for somebody in their in their
 
01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:24.500 align:start position:0%
high five and in a super
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
straightforward not real world example
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
of this is for instance you've got
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
someone who is in a position where
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
they're just working days okay they're
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
not taking any extra shifts or doing
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
anything extra and then in their last
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
five years they're going to sign up for
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
every overtime shift they can so they
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
their compensation is is inflated but
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
when you take the percentage and the
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
rest of their career including the high
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
five it's going to be lower than just in
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
the five because they had zeros for all
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
those other years another example where
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
this could hurt a member is if somebody
 
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
was on a disability for a year so they
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
were only getting you know disability
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
pay they weren't getting any you know
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
short-term disability not permanent
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
things like that so
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
that that's I think where the statement
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't capture all of your
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
money or all of your compensation and
 
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:13.580 align:start position:0%
the high five comes from is that
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
compensation over base calculation and
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
that isn't just specific to the group
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
two uh members in House Bill 436 this is
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
all group two members hired after seven
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
one of eleven and all group one members
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
um you know who were not vested prior to
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
one one of twelve but it works the same
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
for all of them typically the group
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
tooth is more comp over based just
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the work than
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
you know a teacher that's pretty much a
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
contract job you know with maybe a you
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
know a stipend for being department head
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
so it you know wouldn't have as much of
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
an impact but it is it is in the lot
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
consistently for both groups right now
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
so if a group two let's just talk about
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
proof too if they were doing a
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
significant amount of overtime such as
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
the what correctional officers are right
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
so as I understand that many
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
correctional officers are working 60
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
hours rather than 38 and a half or
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
whatever 37 and a half
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
um they're working 60 hours so if they
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
only did that toward the end of their
 
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.610 align:start position:0%
only did that toward the end of their
career

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
with this under the current way we
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
calculate knock that down take away that
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
overtime from their pension or no some
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
of it but not all of it because the the
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
overtime work the overtime worked in the
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the high five some some of that
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
factors in but it's it's it's it's it's
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
against the percentage of the whole you
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
know last 12 years so you know if it's
 
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.810 align:start position:0%
know last 12 years so you know if it's
okay

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:42.470 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
let me put um actually right before I
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
came over I emailed you a handout I did
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
last year on House Bill 1587 which some
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
folks on this committee may remember it
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
it modified the group two tier B portion
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the comp over base slightly and it
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
had an example where if somebody worked
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
25 years and their compensation over
 
01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
25 years and their compensation over
base

01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
um you know was five percent of their
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
pay for 20 years and it was 10 for five
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
years you know
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
um under under
 
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
um under under
um

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
prior law before 1587 that five percent
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
is what would be able to
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
apply to the AFC
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
um last year that added the high five to
 
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
the other career so it ends up being
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
like six percent more instead of the ten
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
percent but it you know it
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
it is by far the most difficult
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
to comprehend and explain
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
um piece of our statute let me ask it a
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
different way suppose somebody worked 60
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
hours a week their whole career yeah
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:35:46.679 --> 01:35:49.310 align:start position:0%
all right
and

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything in 436 would their
 
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
pension be the same would their average
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
final compensation be the same
 
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
either way except for the three five
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
year difference do you see what I mean
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so so their Mount over base would
 
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
be sort of the same if if that you know
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
that hypothetical person in a vacuum you
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
know 50 of their salary was a base and
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
that other fifty percent was comp over
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
base for the entirety of their career
 
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes all of that compensation would count
 
01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the pension count because it was
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
consistent okay throughout the career
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
obviously in the real world things are
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
going to fluctuate and people we have
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
life events that you know prevent them
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
from working certain times but yeah in a
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
vacuum yes you know the I think the idea
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
behind this I think and I think this
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
comp over base was I
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
believe it might have been added in
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on Senate Bill
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
three I don't know if it was fully you
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
know vetted through the Committees in
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate but the idea was to
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
um we you know not penalize someone who
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
worked you know their their job their
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
Community used over time you know to
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
keep staff down so they work you know
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
over time and had differentials their
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
whole career versus the person who only
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
picked them up at the end for this whole
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
intention of doing their their pension
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
and whether whether that actually
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
did what was intended you know a leaf to
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
others but that that was sort of the
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
rationale when this was added
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
um to the statute by the sponsor okay
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
and is this a big change if if we kept
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
this the current definitions for average
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
final compensation
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
but did the the change of the
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
percentages that you know everything
 
01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
became two and a half percent
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
is that a large change to the bill or is
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
that a minor change to the bill
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it is it collectively it probably is
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
a large change to the bill again in
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
those sort of hypothetical situations
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna impact individual
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
members differently based on their pay
 
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
history you know since we've been
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
collecting this data in 2012 so it's not
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
a blanket you know
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
good bad for him and bad for him it
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
could be neutral for one and and you
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
know you know well actually you know
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
better for the other person so it's
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
gonna differ and this there's two you
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
know there's two pieces we're talking
 
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:12.659 align:start position:0%
about AFC and that is the most
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
complicated piece and hard to pin down
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
the the other piece is the earnable comp
 
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:18.709 align:start position:0%
the the other piece is the earnable comp
piece

01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
um in the current bill versus the your
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that took it out is the
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the definition of a runnable comp for
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
the unused
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
um accruals at the end of career you
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
know that that could significantly
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
impact depending on the vacation and the
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah vacation and sick pass
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
depending on the employer and how much
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
they allow people to accrue and at what
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
rate they do it you know that could you
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
know a three-year average of a thirty
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar payout adds ten thousand
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
to your AFC I see you know type of thing
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
so there's two there's two you know the
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
two sections you take out work together
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
in some ways but they both have an
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
impact on um you know the value of the
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
benefit that's it so so I would call
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
adding in unused vacation as that would
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
be more very clearly spiking whereas
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
what you described with this average
 
01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
base thing maybe a little bit less so
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
does that seem reasonable
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that the average base
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
come over base thing a member may have
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
little control over that some depending
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
on on their work situation yes so
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
vacationing uh you know there's
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
different definitions of spiking that
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you that use of accruals is part of
 
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
honorable comp had been in the plan
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
since the beginning until it was taken
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
out for non-vested members in 2011 so
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the legislative behind
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
intent behind making that change was
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
that you know you know I don't want to
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
use the S word or put words in people's
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
mouths 10 years ago but that was you
 
01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
know it had been the legal part of what
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
everyone was doing there was some high
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
profile cases that led to some
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
discussions about this
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
um you know some employers may be very
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
tight on how much people can accrue and
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's not big change other employers I
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
remember they change the policy probably
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
20 years ago but Portsmouth used to have
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
unlimited leave I'm sure that cohort is
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
a sort of retired out of the system by
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
now but you know it it's going to vary
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
among employers on that how much people
 
01:40:22.090 --> 01:40:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
represent chembrels thank you Mr chair
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a suggestion you let me
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
know if this is doable since we're
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
talking about here a death benefit
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
basically if they die on oh this is not
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
this is 436. my apologies
 
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to that and we have
 
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
some thoughts on it okay no apology
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
necessary this is
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
so so let me get back to this one yeah
 
01:40:50.530 --> 01:40:50.540 align:start position:0%
it all of this language
 
01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:54.659 align:start position:0%
you know total and compensation
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
can we just use the words uh average
 
01:41:00.649 --> 01:41:00.659 align:start position:0%
salary or top five years we can't can we
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
it was much easier to do that before the
 
01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
comp over base calculation was added
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
into that that calculation I mean and in
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
shorthand we still do that and I I think
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know some members have said that's
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
confusing for them so it was right to
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
add more language around how comp over
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
base works but you know again you know
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
10 15 years ago somebody you know you
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
know with with the statute and a you
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
know an envelope and a pencil can kind
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
of figure out their own pension benefit
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
because it was more straightforward but
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
with different pay types being excluded
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
for different membership tiers in this
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
comp over base calculation it makes it
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
more opaque to the member what they're
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to end up with you know
 
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.830 align:start position:0%
actually going to end up with you know
um

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
do you normally send people a letter
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
every year saying if you were to retire
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
at such and such a date your pension
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
will be x what once once a member
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
becomes vested after 10 years there's a
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
member annual statement that's issued
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
they're online you can opt to get it by
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
mail instead but and it shows a
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
projected benefit based on the current
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
you know as of June 30th of the year you
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
worked if you know type of thing so
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that that is that is something we put
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
out yeah
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
um any other well so I have a question
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
maybe for representative McGuire or new
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
Marty so the LBA prepared for us to
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
document date of the 20th on the McGuire
 
01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:23.890 align:start position:0%
document date of the 20th on the McGuire
Amendment

01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:23.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:27.380 align:start position:0%
0891h where's that
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it says that the increase of House
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 436 on that amendment to
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
communities will be over 6 million
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
dollars have you seen this document
 
01:42:40.729 --> 01:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I think that was the Pearson
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment from last friday08 918 but you
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
know part of that is some information we
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
um submitted it it's it's actually
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually it reduces the
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
um you know um political subdivision
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
costs from um
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh 14.38 million in contributions to
 
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:02.900 align:start position:0%
9.10 so it you know that Amendment
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
reduced the annual cost to employers
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
going forward by a you know significant
 
01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:10.310 align:start position:0%
going forward by a you know significant
percentage

01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay so this was the Pearson Amendment
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah there's so many that yeah the one
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
that capped the maximum benefit at 125
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
and moved it from 120 to 125 with no
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
escalator okay so so that that lowered
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
the rate impact
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
um on employers for future normal costs
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh by all uh one percent of
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire do you have the
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
latest Amendment what number is your
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
latest Amendment on 4th 36.
 
01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:47.699 align:start position:0%
um good question this was uh
 
01:43:51.609 --> 01:43:51.619 align:start position:0%
hb2 1083.
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like I need a slightly more
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
so Marty while you're here
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay while you're here let me ask you
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
about let's switch gears slightly to
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
um house bill 250.
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
and you you saw the amendment I handed
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
out today
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
so one thing they were complaining about
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
is they say you can't use average final
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
compensation because somebody doesn't
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
have average final compensation until
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're vested that's not so is it no if
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody either you know
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
um you know passed away before vesting
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
or you know was was killed in line of
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
duty you know two years into the job we
 
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
would take the to the salary record we
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
have and average that is what the AFC
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be they wouldn't get you know
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
years of zero or anything like that it's
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to be obviously smaller for
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
somebody starting out but you know
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's happened on occasion because the
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
um acts of death battle accidental death
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
benefit is payable you know for a job
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
related death at any point in somebody's
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
career you know it could be on day one
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
um you know the with the non-job-related
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
death benefit you have to be vested for
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
10 years to apply for that one but this
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
this is at any time in the career so if
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough this is the same if
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
somebody started their Public Safety or
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
public service driving New Hampshire
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
later in their career and they were
 
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
vested by age but didn't have that many
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
years of service we take whatever years
 
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
they have to use the AFC and you know we
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
don't divide it by three and add zeros
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
and things like that okay
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
um now you notice that under current Law
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
Group ones their accidental death
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
benefit is based on average final
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
compensation but group twos are based on
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation right so do you
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
is there any particular reason for that
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
or do you think it's kind of an
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
oversight I I actually don't I Melissa
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
can email me about that at midday and
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed the initial hearing
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
at another midday commitment Jan and I
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
were doing a presentation
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
um so so when I got back to the office I
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
I looked and I I have a copy of the
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
original RSA 100a from 1967. that
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
language is is the same as it was in 67
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
and so then I went down the hall and dug
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
into a file and found a statue for the
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
police retirement just the predecessor
 
01:46:37.450 --> 01:46:37.460 align:start position:0%
system RSA 103 A3
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that language was in that you know
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
back in the early 60s as well so so
 
01:46:45.169 --> 01:46:45.179 align:start position:0%
there was some intent somewhere in the
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
past for the group to accidental death
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to be half of you know annual
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
comp annual learnable compensation
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know it wasn't changed you
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
know five years ago or anything like
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
that it's been around for at least 60
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
plus years
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
so average final compensation is
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
generally less than earnable or not
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily wait you know
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
um it it could potentially cut both ways
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
depending on your if you took a pay cut
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know to move closer to home or
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
something in your oh I see you know but
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
but you know generally the you know the
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
final year of salary and that's it can
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
include you know uh unused time accrued
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
time because you can't take it because
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're not with us anymore kind of thing
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that so there's this stuff that falls
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
into that last year's salary a
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
three-year average
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
typically would be probably lower than a
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
one-year average but again
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
year of earnable compensation is a
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
holdover for many many decades and I and
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
the AFC for group one was in the
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
original statute as well that wasn't
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
modified over time either so
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
um I just think it's better to be
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
consistent but that's me all right
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Cambro yes thank you this
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
is the one that I wanted to make a point
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
on maybe for simplification if it can be
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
done rather than getting through all
 
01:48:05.649 --> 01:48:05.659 align:start position:0%
this gobbley and all this language
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is a death after all that we're
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
talking about are not all lives equal so
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
why couldn't we just offer a lump sum
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
whether that is 85 000 or whether it's a
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand offer and again this is
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
a unique thing not too many deaths occur
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank God so why don't we just outright
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
offer 85 or a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
for any death regardless of time whether
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's one day or 30 years of Duty a death
 
01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
is a death all eyes are equal and offer
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
a lump sum instead of these stupid
 
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.550 align:start position:0%
a lump sum instead of these stupid
formulas

01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
comment Barney what would that
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
completely policy decision so if if you
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
bring that forward we'll run the numbers
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
but um okay I think the constituents may
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
have opinions they'd be willing to share
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
do you know sure do you know what the
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
average of the 19 people currently
 
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
getting benefits um I I received a
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
question through LBA last week about if
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
if the bill was made retroactive
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
um you know and there there are 19
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
spouses currently receiving a you know
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
group two accidental death benefit with
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
an annual payroll of about six hundred
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
thousand I forget if it's a little more
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
or less than this 19 so that's the
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
average is probably about 30 000 you
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
know in that range
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know and fortunately you know
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're blessed that there aren't a ton of
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
Duty related deaths in either group one
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
or group two some of these benefits are
 
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
small because you know the the death
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
occurred in the 70s or the 80s or the
 
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.310 align:start position:0%
occurred in the 70s or the 80s or the
90s

01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
90s
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know we've got a
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
um annuitants receiving that benefit or
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
in their 90s themselves now so they lost
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
their spouse a long time ago
 
01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.410 align:start position:0%
their spouse a long time ago
yeah

01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
so representative cambrell as you raise
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
it interesting way so this would be kind
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
of like a life insurance policy that
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
you'd go out and purchase for you know
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether you get a hundred thousand
 
01:49:59.689 --> 01:49:59.699 align:start position:0%
dollars or half a million dollars but a
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
one-time like a life insurance policy
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
upon someone's death that's kind of what
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at yes I I do want to be
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
sure uh be careful uh this when we give
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
this benefit is it annual to the spouse
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
or it it it's it's paid out as a monthly
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
benefit so you know does it whatever the
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
annual amount is you know whatever the
 
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:21.980 align:start position:0%
number is they pay it annually for a 20.
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
annual amount has been divided by 12.
 
01:50:26.890 --> 01:50:26.900 align:start position:0%
monthly until until they pass away yeah
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
until death of the spouse or remarriage
 
01:50:29.639 --> 01:50:30.790 align:start position:0%
until death of the spouse or remarriage
yeah

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me since we've had all
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
these complicated formulas anyway we
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
could come up with an average amount
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
that would be fair to all whether
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
they're New or Old come up with some
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
average amount and that would be
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
acceptable to all and again these are
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
these deaths are rare so that would be
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
paid on an annual basis not just a
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
one-time payment well that's how it is
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
Into The Spot until the spouse dies oh I
 
01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
know I thought that's what he said
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
earlier like a one-time person that's
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
why I'm correcting myself yes I
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
apologize because I realize that it has
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be uh uh continuing into the spouse
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
dies or until the children are uh 18 18.
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
so and again that's that's rare too and
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
so it's just that these
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
goofy formulas that they have you know
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
very complicated I mean I I learned
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
English you know and I and I know with
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
average compensation means it means
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
something totally different to them and
 
01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
accidental death means something totally
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
different to them than it did to me so
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can simplify this and have
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
them all come to an agreement yeah that
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
makes it representative
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
Salem Sweden thank you Mr chairman yeah
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
just goofy formulas in my head so 19
 
01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
recipients around 600 000 so it's about
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand the original Bill wanted
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
to really double it so I think that
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
number that we'd settle on would be
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
about sixty thousand
 
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
annually for any going forward
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
because it's not retroactive it's
 
01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.330 align:start position:0%
because it's not retroactive it's
I

01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable yeah it's been you
 
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
know yeah all right thoughts on that
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
seems again speaking for myself seems
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
pretty reasonable
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's certainly
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
simple is better hopefully but yeah
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you have a
 
01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you have a
question

01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
surprisingly I didn't find uh
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
Dan's amendment of 250
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
very complicated I thought it was pretty
 
01:52:34.739 --> 01:52:36.490 align:start position:0%
very complicated I thought it was pretty
straightforward

01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:36.500 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
see we would take marriage final
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
compensation all that you know just have
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
a one-time annual payment it's going to
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
be rare
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not like you're going to be
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
calculating it every month or something
 
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.570 align:start position:0%
calculating it every month or something
and

01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:54.709 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me like a simple way to do
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
it what are you going to do you're going
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
to have people with who are making
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
I hate to talk about people dying on the
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
job but they're going to have different
 
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.890 align:start position:0%
job but they're going to have different
salaries

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how you do it lump sum
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
thing I I thought your amendment to 250
 
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:17.629 align:start position:0%
thing I I thought your amendment to 250
was

01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and address the
 
01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:21.109 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and address the
issues

01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:22.669 align:start position:0%
issues
unlike

01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
some of your other amendments
 
01:53:28.729 --> 01:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
it is getting late now yeah again to
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
clarify it's not a lump sum it's a sum
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
that would be divided by 12 and given
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
out every year every month to the
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
spouses or the the kids until they pass
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
away and again I think all lives are
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
equal value if you died on the first day
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
or in the 30th year I think it's a
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
simpler formula and if they don't like
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
it we'll go back to representative uh
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
McGuire's thing and and that that turned
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
out to be a nightmare so
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to get quoted
 
01:53:58.380 --> 01:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
you're going to get quoted
anyway

01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
um is there a figure representative
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
gambrels that you would like to use or
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney for then I like
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
the 60 that representative Sweeney put
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
up because it seems to make sense 30 000
 
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
average now they wanted it doubled we
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
give them 60.
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think I think that's fair all right
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay everybody okay with that or show of
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
hands please
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
could you prepare that for us thanks
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
all right we'll call it a day
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
um unless there's something else Marty
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
could you please be here in the morning
 
01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:44.219 align:start position:0%
at 9 30. absolutely sir and I'll
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
probably repeat the comp over base again
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it you get to sleep on that as well
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
it it's it's extremely complicated
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I can forward that stuff to you if
 
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
you want to forward it to the committee
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm reminded that we've been invited
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
to the governors uh executive Council
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
chamber tomorrow I think at eight
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
o'clock eight something anyway we can
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
all go and see what we think about oplc
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney so Jim do we do
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
we expect tomorrow to take at 9 30 an
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
hour on the retirement bills then an
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
hour on licensing then we solve all the
 
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:21.980 align:start position:0%
other world problems afterwards
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's very little left on there's some
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
a few amendments uh are you going to
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
have another amendment tomorrow for 436
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
for 436 or are you gonna all right well
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're done with 250 now yeah okay
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
um we still have 571 we have it um and
 
01:55:44.649 --> 01:55:44.659 align:start position:0%
you have an amendment for that right
 
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah you got two they're both simple I
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
think but you know
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
there's there's bicycle at yourself yeah
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
I guess it's been a lot more simple than
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
yours right
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
um on oplc I will get Carol will be here
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay okay so
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
um she can answer any questions about
 
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:06.890 align:start position:0%
um she can answer any questions about
that

01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
what else so I I will talk to Carol in
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
detail about 436 okay because I do think
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
those guys
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know they were sent off but maybe
 
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.870 align:start position:0%
you know they were sent off but maybe
not

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
after listening to Marty not
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion there was a
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
confusion but but it may not be
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
justified the level of angst but you
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
know but but we could maybe come up with
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
some kind of compromise because my main
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
thing is I don't want to restore Spike I
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't want them to say okay I've saved
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
up a year worth of vacation so now my my
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
my uh salaries twice what it should be
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
right you know that kind of thing that's
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's the key part of it so
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
all right Johnny you did you have
 
01:56:50.639 --> 01:56:51.649 align:start position:0%
all right Johnny you did you have
something

01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
that you I know you mentioned the other
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
day there was something with Das that
 
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.169 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jody grimbulis
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I represent a company called workday
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
workday is an Erp vendor one of many in
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
the uh in the country working on Erp
 
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
systems throughout the states
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
um there has been several different pots
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
of money that have been sent to
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
either through arpa money which is 15
 
01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
million a couple months ago there's 7.8
 
01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
million in the house bill 2. we approved
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
the other day and we have no problem
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
with that whatsoever the state should
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
take the money they're going to need to
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
upgrade the new system and the only
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing I would ask one of the things that
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
we have talked about a little bit
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
um is that could it go out for
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
competitive procurement I think right
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
now it's being looked at as a sole
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
source and I guess there are a number of
 
01:57:59.089 --> 01:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
players in the industry that would like
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to at least say there
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
are three years until that system
 
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.910 align:start position:0%
are three years until that system
becomes

01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:06.050 align:start position:0%
becomes
um

01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
not functional I think it's April 2026
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
is what was said in the arpa funds is
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
that when that system becomes on
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
um unusable and so if there is a little
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
bit of time between now and then does it
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
hurt the state to at least do an RFP or
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
at least a request for information from
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
the vendor Community to see what's up so
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
I have language that would add just a
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
sentence that maybe that should be
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
looked at and that is my request
