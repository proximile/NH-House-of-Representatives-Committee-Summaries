state had not employed an actuary if
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
where where where would the actuary come
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
from to provide the independent report
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding this work was all
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
recently done for uh Medicare Medicare
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid and so that the data is out
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
there and all the information is
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
available already it was just done the
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%

to be updating the information they have
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
453 thank you Mr chairman this is making
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to the Statewide voter
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
registration system and I understand
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire would like to
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
offer a recommendation of interim study
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
yes I would thank you um so all right
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
so we had new we have new since we met
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
we met and and this uh we didn't have
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
any problem with this um uh bill because
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
we were told that everybody liked it the
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
both our election law committee and the
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the one from the Senate and so on
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
but since then there this is just the
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation and there's a companion
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
bill which I unfortunately don't know
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
the number of but um we're told that the
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
Senate is going to itl the companion
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill which has the policy involved in
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
creating this this uh voter registration
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
portal and therefore this spending is
 
00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:45.110 align:start position:0%
portal and therefore this spending is
unnecessary

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that the an interim
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
study motion is uh is appropriate
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
because if the Senate decides they
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually you know change their mind yet
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
again and go forward with that bill they
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
can ask for a committee of conference on
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and then we can agree to to
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
passing it but but assuming that they're
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with their current
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
plans and not pass that bill then this
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make sense so interim study
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative papich Mueller
 
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
discussion representative papich Mueller
you

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
seconded it's already been seconded has
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
published representan question
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um thank you I would
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
just ask uh representative McGuire um
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
when that vote was
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
taken I understand maybe representative
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
Sweeney can comment but I understand it
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
was a committee vote but not yet a floor
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
vote in the Senate so there's still
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
still time to argue with them if that's
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
do further
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
discussion represent walner yes thank
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
you so explain to me what would happen
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
if the Senate um moved ahead and um did
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
pass the bill then there wouldn't be an
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation so this sort of like is it
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
the horse before the cart or the cart
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
horse yeah so thank you for the question
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
so again I think if they decide to go
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
ahead then they will ask us for comme of
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
conference on this bill oh is that not
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
true so we we'd have to we can't right
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
well if you if you know that they've
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
passed this before we have an action in
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the house then you could have a floor
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to pass to make this bill out
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
to pass I see you say yeah yeah yeah Mr
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mr chairman would it be
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to uh basically table this
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
bill till tomorrow
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
so we can have some further discussion
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
about this outside of the meeting and
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on and and I think
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea to put it off we
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
put it at the end of end of agenda
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I I think that's okay without a
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
problem we'll uh take this one up
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow any
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%

more and we'll be meeting again tomorrow

representative
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
evil thank you very much um I move ought
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
to pass on Senate Bill 47
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
76 second okay motion and second V to
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
pass on Senate Bill 476 would you like
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
to go into the finances of it I would um
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill proposes to um appropriate
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
$40 million which is admittedly a large
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
amount um this would be uh Capital
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation so it would be raised
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
through bonds the expend
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
for interest is estimated to be about uh
 
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
for interest is estimated to be about uh
$4.6

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
$4.6
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
million annually um commissioner Hanks
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
came and spoke to us about the uh
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
condition of the prison and you heard
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about the condition of the
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
prison from chair makoni who heads up
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways in our last um
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
session when we talked at length about
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
the condition of the prison
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
we did ask the treasurer to come in and
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
chat with us because obviously this is a
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
large um amount of money it is off cycle
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's out of the capital budget in the
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
last capital budget we appropriated 10
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
million even though the request was for
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
50 the upshot is for this uh amount of
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
money it would be for the architectural
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
engineering programming design and
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
construction documents for a new prison
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
for the men um you know you can't kick
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
the can down the road forever and at
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
some point we have to uh start to move
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
forward because we recognize that the
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
condition of the men's uh prison if
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
you've ever been there you know this and
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
if you haven't take our word for it um
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
it it it needs um it needs something uh
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner made a very effective
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh present ation about the millions and
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars it was
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
going to take to uh maintain the prison
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
um if we didn't replace it and also
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
there are litigation concerns always
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
when you let uh the prison deteriorate
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
which we experienced with the women's
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
prison which I think we can all agree we
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
put off too long um we asked quite a few
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
questions and we were convinced uh not
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
only the desirability of moving forward
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
with this uh we um were satisfied that
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
the amount that they were talking about
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the appropriation was uh the right
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
amount and of course it could uh go down
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
we did talk about other models of
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
Prisons that were being built that we
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
could look at um and all in all
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
especially after our conversation with
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
the with the treasurer we were convinced
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
um unanimously
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
that we should go forward with this bill
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
so on that basis I would ask the
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
committee to join division one and vote
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you further
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
discussions comments questions
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yes thank you Mr
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I I would agree that this is
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
some this is a big expenditure and it's
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
just the start uh we're told that the
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
prison eventually will cost something
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
like 550 million but we're talking about
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
a capital expenditure that will be uh
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
you know used by the state for many many
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
decades and so it's appropriate to
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
borrow the money and the current state
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
of the prison in conquered is horrible
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
and and it needs to be um it needs to be
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
changed and and needs to be updated and
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
the good news is that the biggest
 
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
expense of the Corrections Department is
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
personnel we're currently spending in
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
excess of
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
$70,000 per inmate for operational
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
expenses and the design of a prison can
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
be done in a much more efficient way
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
than it was back in the 18 whatevers
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
when when conquered was designed and so
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
therefore it's possible by having a new
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
prison we will we will save money on the
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
operational aspects of
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
that represent Edwards for question uh
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't know if that was
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
humor or not you said the prison was
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
built in the 1800s could you do you we
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
have a real date for the opening of the
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
prison well the original building was
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh built I believe before the
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
state house um because I understand that
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
the architect who did the state house
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
got the job because he had designed the
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
prison and and got it in under budget on
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
time and under
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
budg and so
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I guess the the but that
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
building it's on the same location but
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
that building which was because the
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
State House is
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
1819 um and the prison the original
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
building at the prison was was um 18
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
like 15 or something like that that
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
building's no longer there but the the
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
current building is 1878 and then there
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
are newer buildings also
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a very old building
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's 150 years you know
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
so further
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%

post
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
licensing and provides both Ina
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary inactive service status and
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
non-voluntary inactive service status it
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
also provides requirements for an active
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
status as well as a process for the
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
reinstatement to active status from
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
inactive status there is no appropriate
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
bill uh as most of you know I'm a CPA
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
but I've also held a real estate license
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
since I was aged
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
19 and I've only given it up in the last
 
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
19 and I've only given it up in the last
few

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
years um as best I could tell from read
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
carefully reading this bill it doesn't
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
change a lot of the current practice it
 
00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
change a lot of the current practice it
does

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
clarify that a realtor who earns a
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
commission as active
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
status can collect that commission after
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
becoming inactive
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
status and uh other than that it's it's
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much the just relates how things
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
have been going and redefines so it
 
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.430 align:start position:0%
have been going and redefines so it
defines

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
defines
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
postlicensing period which I believe is
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh from the time the license is issued
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
till the time it's first
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
renewed did I hear you say say that
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
there's no cost there there is no
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
be able to get it after the next two
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%

until the the end of work today um so I
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%

difference between the amendment that's
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%

may yeah basically what the
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment does two
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
things uh one there was a question
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
raised about the constitutionality of
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill making a uh making a payment to
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
an individual rather than a class of
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and uh the amendment
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
issue uh by incorporating it into the
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
bill and uh the second thing the uh the
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it uh it includes uh
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
well part of part of making it
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional is includes security
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
officers with police officers as those
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
who were killed in the line of duty U
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
are eligible for the $100,000 payment
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
the police officers are eligible for uh
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
the second thing the bill does is it
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
clarifies that it's only full-time
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
police offices and
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
full-time uh
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
security uh it's only for fulltime uh
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
police officers permanent permanent
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
security officers that will be eligible
 
00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.030 align:start position:0%
security officers that will be eligible
for

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
this I
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
think represent Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.710 align:start position:0%
think represent Maguire thank you Mr
chairman

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.710 align:start position:0%
chairman
so

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
um yes so so most of that was was
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
completely correct so this was the bill
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
to pay $100,000 to the family of Officer
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
hos who was killed at New Hampshire
 
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.670 align:start position:0%
hos who was killed at New Hampshire
hospital

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh very tragically and so
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
um and the reason and and we have an
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
existing um we have an existing benefit
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
for those that are killed in the line of
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
duty and it includes not just um police
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
officers but also firemen and um Public
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
Works officers and so on there's a whole
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
list and so this the reason that um
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
officer 's case didn't apply is because
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
he was a part-time security officer at
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
the hospital and security officers were
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
not on the list so the last line 24 of
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment adds security officers to
 
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:12.990 align:start position:0%
the amendment adds security officers to
the

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
list but
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but the uh in reading that whole
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
section of law we also pay this um this
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
benefit in certain circumstances that
 
00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
benefit in certain circumstances that
include

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
suicide and the argument there is that
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
suicide is uh can frequently be the
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
result of
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
PTSD it's job related and so but since
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
I'm adding some part-time people to this
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
list it seems to me that um that if
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're if your job is going to create a
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
PTSD type situation that would be for
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
full-time full-time employees and not
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
part-time so this
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
eliminates the U cause of this uh
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
payment in cases of suicide of
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
part-timers and and keeps it in the case
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
of full-timers
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Edwards for a question
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I had uh
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment um uh that draft
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
was drafted by OS to representative
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
Maguire and to representative Lee
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh I did that Amendment after
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
consultation with um one of the Senators
 
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
who is the key sponsor of the of the
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill and uh based on my understanding of
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
the facts uh Mr hos was a contractor he
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
he was not employed by the state and and
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
so the the intent of my amendment was to
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
incorporate Mr hass's uh death uh uh
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
gratuiti that's not the right word but
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
uh the death benefit the to to to
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
basically say that if we have contracted
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
out a
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
Frontline Security role that those
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
positions also would be included in the
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
future and and I I did that to make sure
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
that he was in the right category
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
assuming he was a contractor and and I I
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
just don't think it's good precedent for
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
us to be doing benefits by name after
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
the fact I think we should look for
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
categorical opportunities and and I'm
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
not I so I guess my first question sir
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
is what status was Mr hon I I understood
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
he was a contractor not an employee and
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
if and if that's the case line 24
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it for
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
me well I've heard from Senate a senator
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
as well and he says there's others
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
believe with him the family has said
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
they just want a clean bill that
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes him they don't want any other
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
amendments they don't want any other
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
people included in it and so if we put
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
in an amendment it's it looks acceptable
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
to me but if it if we vote this
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
amendment in and it goes to a committee
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
of conference then the Senate will
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
likely want this amendment removed just
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
a heads up um at least we've heard from
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
some of the Senators on this this
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment his name is still in the Bill
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes right this this is rather than make
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
new categories we could just just by
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
saying passing the bill with the person
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
named you don't have to worry about what
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
category he was in what his employment
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
status was if there's a bill that names
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
him that's
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient so representative Sho you had
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
a comment thank you Mr chair um I've
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
been pretty heavily involved in this
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
section of the RSA uh having sponsored
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
the portion that included the Public
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
Works employees uh as as soon as Chief
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
hos was uh killed I made similar
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
inquiries to representative Edwards and
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
I agree he was a different category I
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
would add a further
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
complication uh the the term including
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
suicide but the end of that sentence
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
says while in the performance of his or
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
her duties I would submit it's very rare
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
that someone commits suicide while they
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
are performing their duties it's usually
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
while they're off duty so I think that's
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
a a further complication that this
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
forward further comments representa hle
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um to the prior
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
comment I believe that the issue
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
regarding involving suicide comma right
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
in the performance of his or her duties
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
is current law so we're not making a
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
change there um
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
I have always had concerns about when we
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
start um addressing suicide with a death
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
benefit that we potentially have an
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of encouraging
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
someone who's facing severe depression
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
already that they now have yet a
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
financial um incentive to end their life
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's not that's not the purpose of this
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
bill it but it has
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
been there is an issue of an unintended
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
consequence when you allow suicide side
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
to be included but that's not the
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill this is regarding a
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
person who was employed either directly
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
or indirectly by the state of New
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a security guard um
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
guarding the state hospital potentially
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
a place that could be dangerous he was
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the metal detector um it is my
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding from news reports he was
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
still alive by the time he made it to
 
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
still alive by the time he made it to
the

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.270 align:start position:0%
the
hospital

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
and the underlying cause of what led to
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
this un tragic circumstances hasn't been
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
addressed or sorry is currently being
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
addressed by new rfps by the department
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure security guards are in fact
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
armed at our various institutions um
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
disarming a security guard is a real
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
danger to their life um so I I agree
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
with what we're trying to do for changes
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
here I just want to make sure that um
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
this passes muster relative to um
 
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
this passes muster relative to um
retroactive

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
law someone else
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you uh
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to assume that
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
representative Shu has confirmed what I
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
said that the that Mr hos was serving as
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
a contractor at the time of U of his
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
being shot to death and I very much want
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
to help uh their family and support
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
their family talking to the uh Senator
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I think that was you talked to as
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
well he I was supposed to be given the
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
phone number so I could talk to the
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
family and that number
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
never came to me as a promised um or I
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
would have checked on it personally that
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
that that this alternative approach
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
would be good uh I I I'm I'm I would
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
like to ask either representative Lehman
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
or Maguire if they have a copy of the
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I emailed them I'd like the
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
ability to enter that Amendment into
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
discussion unfortunately I don't see
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
think I ever saw that amendment I don't
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
know if representative mgu did or yeah I
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
I did um I don't know if LBA has it it
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
should have my name on it Edwards I
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't know um yeah I can you know if you
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
gave if you want to recess for for eight
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
minutes or something I can print them
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
protect their family but I I want to do
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
it in a way in which um we're not doing
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
one-offs retroactively it just it just
 
00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:56.670 align:start position:0%
one-offs retroactively it just it just
looks

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
looks
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh inappropriate from a principal and
 
00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.750 align:start position:0%
uh inappropriate from a principal and
consistency

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
perspective represent Heath for a
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you um Mr chair I too um
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
have spoken with um some of the Senators
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
and their intent in this bill was to
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
honor this man for what he did um for
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
his family and I think that we're
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
getting away from that intent and
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
purpose I mean this is our way that we
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
can honor him for giving his life for us
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and for so many at the state hospital
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
so I would love to see this bill go
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
forward unamended as is so that we can
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
honor um this man in the manner in which
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
he should be honored thank you very
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
discussion representative lean then I'll
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
come back to you and representative
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
walner yeah just a followup to
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative Heath it would certainly
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
be cleaner if you if you look at the as
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
it came to us from the Senate it doesn't
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
matter whether he's a contractor or
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else he was shot and killed and I
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
think we should honor this bills that
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
came forward is it says here a
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
department of safety security officer
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether he was in a contract or again
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
part-time employee I think we really
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
ought to move this forward and uh pass
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 appropriation without mucking
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
it up represent
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
walner I would agree um and it if um
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
be amendments to this particular
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
language about death by Suicide it seems
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
to me it's not in this bill I mean this
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
is not the time or the place to be doing
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
that it should have had a public hearing
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a whole another subject matter
 
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
and um for that I think we should go to
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
Bill okay we'll wait till representative
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire comes back in representative
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
Edwards again so so I just I just want
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people understands the
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
understand the Deep sympathy I have for
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
I I've served with people who've died in
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
the line of duty I get
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
it I just think that it's important for
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
us to to honor the family and to do it
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the right principled way and that is
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
not a call out simply by name if the
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
goal is to honor him we can do that in a
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
resolution I I I I don't think that's
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do we're trying to
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate $100,000 to for for a
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
particular purpose for a particular
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
person that benefits and that's all it's
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
all okay but I think there's a better
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
way to do it and I I really would like
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh you all to just maintain an open mind
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
until you can see what I the am the
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd like to bring forward R
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
zone a hold and then pres groa thank you
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
um if you had asked me the day after
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
this un unfortunate tragic murder
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
whether he was covered I would have
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
thought yes based on the job he was
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
serving um I'm aware of the the death
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
benefit policy that's been in statute
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and I would have
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
said he would have been qualified under
 
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.190 align:start position:0%
said he would have been qualified under
the

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.270 align:start position:0%
the
prior

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
language um but for the technicalities I
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
go I guess and the fact that we had
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
someone serving um to protect other
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
employees to protect our patients as a
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
security guard who was then murdered on
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
the job um who was not
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
covered I think we need to do something
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
but I also know that we need to at some
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
point address the underlying policy and
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
I think that was the attempt of the
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
committee to make sure that those
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
positions in the future that are serving
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
that that role of security um are in
 
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.069 align:start position:0%
that that role of security um are in
fact

01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
protected representative groda
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair coming from a policy
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee that often addresses these
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
matters I would recommend to this
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
committee that you pass the bill
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
unamended and leave it as is and then
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
address this issue on a policy issue so
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
that we know we have it in the right
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
place because this amendment right now
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
is at odds with what is in St statute
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to create a situation
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
where you have things conflicting or not
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
in compliance or meshing so that would
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
be my agreement I understand
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards position and I
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
agree with it and sympathize I just
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that this amendment is the
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
right thing for the right for right now
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
that's my recommendation to you thank
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right is represent
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
Maguire back yet no
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
he did find my Amendment and we're just
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
making copies now my my copy doesn't
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
address the issue of suicide at all I I
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
would I don't think that's appropriate
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
bill okay we have uh one Amendment
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
before us from
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative is that representative
 
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
representative is that representative
Maguire's

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes
 
01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:27.870 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes
all

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
right representa McGuire there's not
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
great acceptance among the group for
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
your Amendment but we'll put it up for a
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
it would you like to discuss the
 
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
alternative first sure if you've got it
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
out so uh this or maybe representative
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards would like to speak I I can
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
permitted Mr chair you already recognize
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
to spe all right so um so I wanted to
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
verify a few things with OS the key
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to verify was uh that it
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
was constitutional to do a retroactive
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
benefit and in indeed it is uh and
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
there's precedent for it so those people
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
worried about the constitutionality of
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
looking back to to provide a benefit
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't need to concern
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
themselves too much about that what what
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
my Amendment does is it inserts at line
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 um a simple line that says
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety security officers
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
assigned to provide public facing
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
Security Services whether contracted or
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
employed directly and and and and what
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
that gets at is this would put it into
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
statute where Mr hos would uh his family
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
would benefit from this amendment and
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
and be eligible for the death benefit so
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh and it does it in a way in which I
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
think we preserve um the the the
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
principles of not assigning specific
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you um one would argue
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
if they were in the Edna committee that
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
that was their po policy area and you in
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
the finance committee shouldn't be doing
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
policy independent of that committee
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's just something we may hear
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
amendment I I would like to move um my
 
01:05:45.279 --> 01:05:46.990 align:start position:0%
amendment I I would like to move um my
Amendment

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
20241 1599 Hotel I'll second okay um do
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
we you have an extra uh sheet to call
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
the role second Mr chairman
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
question yes is it an intent to take Mr
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
hass's name off the bill because that's
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
what you're doing by this
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that wasn't an intent but that
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
would be a consequence um so there there
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
could be a way to uh to tweak this so
 
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't remove his name uh from
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
the underlying
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
bill I like I said I I think his family
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
should be honored this is a legislative
 
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.109 align:start position:0%
should be honored this is a legislative
act

01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
um the sequence of event would be such
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that um if this was amended it would go
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
back to the Senate there'd be a
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and it would
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to go to the governor and so on if
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
we passed the bill as it came to us from
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate then it would go and we
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
didn't make any changes it would go
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
right to the governor and it would
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
expedite perhaps the payment to the
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
family just just for further comment Mr
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that if we're going to
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
do something like this I think there's
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion here today that
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
maybe this is something for further
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation next year uh not to do this
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
if you know we supported in those of us
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
in division one supported the amendment
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
as it was to try to add these other
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
positions in but I think it's
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
complicating the issue and I think that
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is pass the the bill
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
as it came to us send it to the
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
governor's desk it it achieves what we
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
want to achieve all this other stuff is
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
additional legislation I think needs to
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
be dealt with by the policy committee
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
next session representative Hall thank
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um relative to the naming
 
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
if we left the title in the bill and on
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
line six said amend the bill by
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
replacing section two instead of all
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
after the enacting Clause the title of
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
the bill would still be there relative
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
to officer um Bradley hos but it would
 
01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.390 align:start position:0%
to officer um Bradley hos but it would
address

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
concurrently the Gap in our statutes
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
relative to someone who is serving as
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
security um and that Amendment could be
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
easily drafted for tomorrow morning
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
which would be this text with one
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
additional line being the current
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
title so I guess we have a motion before
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
us for Amendment
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
1599 so to dispose of that Amendment
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
call all right let's all right show of
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
hands all in favor of 1599 raise your
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
hand one
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
hand the majority says no
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%

01:08:28.679 --> 01:08:32.669 align:start position:0%
all right Amendment defeated
by

01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
hands representative McGuire do you wish
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
to move an
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendment but you already told me my
 
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
amendments won't pass right so said I
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
already told you what while I was out of
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
the room no what no we did not vote on
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
it without you being here oh I see I
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that well no but you said
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't uh I well all right fine
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
I I will move Amendment 1695 H so this
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
has the advantage it still set has the
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph with with officer hass's name
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
and it's it's very similar to the one we
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
just proposed it's just that it doesn't
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
have the word Contracting under security
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
officers it has this security officer
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
line right so further discussion on
 
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.910 align:start position:0%
line right so further discussion on
Amendment

01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
1695 wa a second I'll second it for
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
discussion but I will not be supporting
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment representative leean
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
seconded further discussion seeing none
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
I assume you're ready for the vote we'll
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
do it again by raising hands all those
 
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
hand two
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
opposed overwhelmingly
 
01:09:51.679 --> 01:09:53.390 align:start position:0%
opposed overwhelmingly
defeated

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay we still have before for us I
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
believe a motion of ought to pass is
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
that was that what you made
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and representa
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
Sweeney seconded a motion of ought to
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
pass I I will change my motion to ought
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
to pass on Senate Bill
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
604 without any Amendment make it clear
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
that it's ought to pass without any
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment Mr chair represent Sweeney
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
second further discussion representative
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards is out of the room and I think
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
he would probably like to be included in
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
the vote I'll wait for him to return I
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
didn't even notice him
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
leave represent papich Miller thank you
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair while we are waiting for
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I know that he
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
was suggesting that he would like to um
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
redraft his amendment in order to
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
address at least some of the concerns of
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
the committee and under the
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances I was wondering if maybe
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to give him you
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
know until tomorrow to do so and uh then
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
we can consider that Amendment and then
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
dispose of the bill it would not impact
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
our ability to put the bill on the same
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
house calendar I hope we can move
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
through the schedule tomorrow as quickly
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
as we have
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
today so we also agreed to put off
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
553 which we had an amendment before us
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
that people wanted a chance to read and
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
I wonder if if we are ready to take
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
it was it was put before you look
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
through your stack it might be buried
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
under one of the other amendments so Mr
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
chairman we do have 188h but we don't it
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
have the newest version that includes
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
the sunset language this is what this is
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
not the new the latest version of the
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
amendment we're still waiting so we're
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait till tomorrow on
 
01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait till tomorrow on
that

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
one uh either if we can get it before
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
the end of day today or tomorrow we can
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
do it tomorrow we're about to wrap up
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
for the day because everything else we
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
have has been
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
put off for also Senate Bill 591 has an
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
amendment coming no all right are we
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
ready to take some action on Senate Bill
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
591 and do we have an amendment we do
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
not have the uh representative McGuire's
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment for 591 on 591 yeah okay so
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
last

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
three Mr chair could I please ask for
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
clarification again why are we delaying
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
understand um wait Ed we were waiting
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
for the return of represent Edwards for
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
the motion of just simply ought to pass
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
and decided to wait for him to return
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
before we head that
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
vote representative T thank you Mr
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I just don't know if if a
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
recess of till maybe 2:30 could be would
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
be enough time or not I'm looking to the
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
LBA people is that your request I'm
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if they believe that if we
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
recess to 230 if there's a chance the
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments would be drafted by then I
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm directing the question
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
through you to them all right
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
and LBA any question any answer to that
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
I think that would give OS a little bit
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
more time to draft these because they
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
just got them before lunch so all right
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
we'll take a break till till 2:30 and
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
see if we can wrap up any of the these
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%

all right you may have some amendments
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
in your place you can look at while
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.119 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
order

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:29:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
waiting on oh no she is
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
okay who's gone uh Connie Lane oh she's
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%

okay so we're gonna voting 64 straight
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
is it being 2:30 I'll call the finance
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
committee back from recess and we'll
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
continue we have before us an active uh
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
a to pass without Amendment ought to
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
pass on Senate Bill
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
604 uh we took some a moment for
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
everybody to look at that and realize it
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
was just a h Bill and nothing else so
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
everyone understand it is there any
 
01:31:09.159 --> 01:31:10.189 align:start position:0%
everyone understand it is there any
further

01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
discussion and we have a member that
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
says he won't be back representative
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman so I'm I'm
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to the B the reason whole reason
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to amend the bill in the first
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
place and not is not to not pay uh
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
officer H's family but I have a problem
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I think the bill as written is
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by part one article 10
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
so in my reading of part one article 10
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
constitution we cannot simply write a
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
check and and pay someone specifically
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
by name that's the problem and and we
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
can we can set policy and have benefits
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
and all those kind of things but to but
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
to single out a specific person you know
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
if I I couldn't you know write a check
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
to you know Joe Smith um uh and make a
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
bill like that right so um so that's
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill effectively does now of
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
course there's good reasons and all that
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff but I think we want I
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
wanted an amendment to make it General
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
right so that it's it's not we're not
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
writing a check to a specific person
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're writing a check to someone in this
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
situation right what part of the
 
01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution are you talking about part
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
one article 10 well how does it read
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
well I can I can quote it to you if you
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
two represent hacken Phillips I I I was
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
here last term when we had a specific
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
bill um with an appropriation that um
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
was defined as folks who had uh lost um
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
some money due to
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
some Investments I'll try not to
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
characterize what type of Investments
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
but um you know I I do believe that
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
there were very few limited people who
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
benefited from that
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that was not deemed
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and in this case we are
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a family um who will
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
benefit from this appropriation so again
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's another class of folks that will
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
benefit so I don't believe there is a
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional concern and furthermore I
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the Senate has clearly had
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
the moment and the time to think through
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
the same issue and they found it fit to
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
pass it along to our house uh
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
furthermore the policy committee also
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
approved it so here we are looking at
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
the appropriation and I think it's our
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
duty um on this committee to really
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
focus on that Financial commitment and
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state um is capable
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
of making that appropriation so I I
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
would move I hope my colleagues will
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
join me and move forward with approving
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass for
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
604 thank you so I have the section and
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we are all
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
individually sworn to uphold the
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution and whether others read it
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
in a different way or whatever that's
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's you're referring to
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
article 10 right of Revolution yeah it
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
that that's just that's not actually the
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
title is not part of of the Constitution
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's put in by the Secretary of
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
State but what it's here's the first
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
sentence government being instituted for
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
the common benefit protection and
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
security of the whole community and not
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
for the private interest or aument of
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
any one man family or class of
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
men all right so government is not for
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
anyone the ENT of any one man family or
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
class of men which is
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
how I would describe this bill we could
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
deny payments to
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
employees I mean it's it's kind of wide
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
contracts yeah um even
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
$100 M Mr shair yeah represent hle thank
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I would like to note in
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
the docket that this has not gone via
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
any house policy committee that when it
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
came over from the Senate it was
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
referred to finance directly and not
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
through let's say Edna which it might
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
have been because it is a typical policy
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
that would have gone through Edna that
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
for some reason in the process it
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
skipped a policy committee so I do think
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
having policy discussions might be
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
appropo in the fact that on the docket
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
it did not get to a policy committee
 
01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.189 align:start position:0%
it did not get to a policy committee
this

01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
time thank you further
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Maguire thank
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and and again the reason
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're passing this bill or or or want to
 
01:35:59.550 --> 01:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
is not because it was officer hos
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
specifically it's because of the
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
situation he was in right it's it it is
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
for a general purpose right we we would
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
want to give this benefit to anyone in
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
that situation whether it's Joe Smith or
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
hos or anybody else right so that's the
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
whole point of of passing the amendment
 
01:36:19.159 --> 01:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
whole point of of passing the amendment
thank

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
you representative grot thank you uh Mr
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to tell the committee
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
that because the bill was written as
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
such and did not include specific policy
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is why it went directly to finance
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
and did not need to come to anything to
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%

study all right now I believe we have an
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
553 and rep representative Sween is
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
recognized to describe it Mr chairman at
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
this time I move Amendment 1910 H to uh
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
553 uh this bill I'll second it thank
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh this
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill we we certainly heard a lot during
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
testimony about it we've taken the
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
Senate version of the bill and we've
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
scaled it to a an encouragement Bill and
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's really the best way to
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
describe what this amendment does is it
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
encourages that funds deposited in PP uh
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
be invested in collateralized in New
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with the shall strive
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
language to make that encouragement but
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
it also makes it so that they shall
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
obtain the highest rate uh rating
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
possible uh for stable local government
 
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
Investments uh so it's really trying to
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
build the strongest system possible
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
while encouraging reinvestment into the
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we certainly
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
heard about the economic benefits
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
investing in New Hampshire will and we
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
heard the concerns from the towns and
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
counties uh so this amendment really
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
does seem to fix
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
strive to fix uh by encouraging the
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
investment in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
while ensuring that return on investment
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
is still the the priority of it uh the
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
the new version of the amendment as I
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier has a sunset clause
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
in it so that it will be repealed come
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2030 so the uh that goes
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
into effect December 30th 2030 that
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
provision of the repeal um so that we
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
can have an opportunity to review in the
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
coming years whether or not this policy
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
change has a notable impact on PP or the
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
community towns and the investment and
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
the future legislature can go from there
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so the sunset provision is in this
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and the I think the
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought and a good
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
deal was was struck on the underlying
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you in line 20 uh Roman
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
confusing no less than 30% of the funds
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
held by the public posit public deposit
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
investment pool and insure in insured or
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
collateralized deposits that meet the
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
requirements it seems like we're pushing
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that back into the bill that we didn't
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
want in there so so thank you Mr
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
chairman that sentence does start that
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
phrasing starts with the term shall
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
strive which is an encouragement with no
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism so it's simply the
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
legislative intent to d uh for for that
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
to occur with no enforcement or
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that that be the the case
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's simply purely
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
encouragement the original bill as
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
presented from the Senate was 100% in
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
invested in insured and collatz in New
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's it's simply
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
encouragement that 30% B representative
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair uh two
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
points the first one is a small one I I
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say December December
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
31 2030 for Sunset I I I thought June
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
30th 2030 was being floated what are you
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
did you say it the way you want it yeah
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I I had it as December 30th
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
2030 okay the I I had talked to a
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or somebody and it sounded like
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
because of the Contracting Rhythm Jun
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
June 30 was the was the right day of
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
2030 but I'm I'm not going to okay bite
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
over months after so they can still fix
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
the contract before followup followup
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and then when this was being
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
discussed with a a a friend from the
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
other body um it was suggested that line
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
21 would be up to 30% not no less than
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
30% what what what kind of discussions
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
did have been had about 30% whether
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create a a a a ceiling
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
to strive for or a floor to to not fail
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
to meet I I think thank you for the
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
question repres I think with the
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
language of shall strive the different
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
up two or no less has no practical
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
impact since it's we really just want
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
them to get to 30% but there's no with
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
no expectation or requirement to get
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
there uh I think the terms obviously if
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
if the other body feels strongly about
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
that they can form a committee
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
conference and I would volunteer to
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
serve onor all right thank you for the
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
answers representative

and has been a great
 
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
success its goal has always been to

obtain the best return available with
 
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.550 align:start position:0%

01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%

collateralized the uh the Amendments
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
that are offered Sofer those
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
requirements somewhat but there's no
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
need for amendments this bill is a bad
 
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
Bill and we should not pass it all the
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
users of the pool that we heard from
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
oppose the law due to the likely
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
deterioration of their investment
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
returns in 2020 3 the law was amended to
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
place the trust under the state
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
treasurer the state the state treasur
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the pool's advisory committee are
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
currently reviewing and developing
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
policies and objectives for the pool the
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
legislature should let that process play
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
out without mandating a geographical
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
constraint on that process that may
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
limit the pool's returns please support
 
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
the Judgment of your County city and
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
your town treasurers by opposing this
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
bill I plan to oppose the
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
bill and uh if the Amendments pass they
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
soften the bills somewhat but even the
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
amended bill I plan to vote
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
against further discussion represent
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
grassy yes Mr chairman I I'm not opposed
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the amendment because I think the
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
amendment makes the bill better than
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
what it was as far as the municipal and
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
town and and and trustees of trust funds
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
that are out there currently and and I
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
think that it really you know just makes
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
it aspirational I'm a little wondering
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
why we have to Sunset something that's
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
aspirational but obviously that's what
 
01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
the bill the amendment that we have
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
before us and I'm willing to to support
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I will oppose the bill
 
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
because I think that you know as
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin said we had just
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
about every Town Administrator and
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
County Administrator here T telling us
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
that they did not want to see this
 
01:45:59.310 --> 01:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
change they want to see us to to to not
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
do this this time to let the state
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
treasurer it's only been put into her
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
hands this past year to let the state
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer work on their policy and and
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
then if there's a you know if if there's
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
a problem uh you know we can deal with
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the future what I would recommend is
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we take the amended bill and we
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
send it to inim study because that's
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
something I think that we need to take a
 
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
look at to address the issues that they
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
have because the this negotiated
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
settlement was not not done in
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
consultation with any of the towns or or
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
Trustees of the trust funds this was
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
something that was done by the treasurer
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the banking and the and the bankers
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
Association I think that you know this
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
has been let the treasurer do their job
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
let's inum study this to see what
 
01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
happens over the next 12 months and then
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
we can you know a bill can possibly come
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
in in the fall if nothing happens over
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
the summer to to deal with this issue
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
but right now we need to have more
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
involvement by the municipalities in
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
this and that's who we represent is the
 
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.390 align:start position:0%
this and that's who we represent is the
municipalities

01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's why I will I will vote
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment but I will
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill I think the orders I
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
have of of questions is going to be
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham representative
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
papichi then representative Hull
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham is recognized
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I was intending to
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
not uh support the uh the base bill but
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
I am going to support the amendment and
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
I will support the bill as amended I did
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
talk to my cities and towns and our
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
County uh our County for example has 5
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
million and PP out of 35 million total
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
investment uh the rest is all invested
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
in state so there's still a lot of money
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh I believe uh uh going that direction
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
um and um but there was a siment that
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is State money and it makes sense
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that uh everything else being equal
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
would be good for the money to stay in
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
state and um with an aspirational
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that's put forward this way
 
01:47:53.229 --> 01:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
um uh I think I think think that's
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
enough that uh uh when the fund is going
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
out to look at places to put their money
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard that uh there was 20
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
Banks they do business with none of them
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh it it'd be nice that
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh they consider New Hampshire as part
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
portfolio uh and um I think this uh
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
amended Bill does that and uh I
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
complement both The Originators and the
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
amends for for doing this work thank you
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative papovich Muller thank you
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in the interest of brevity I
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
will state that I second most of the
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
statement of my colleague representative
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
Grassi a couple of differences between
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
me and him I don't really see this as an
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
aspirational policy I see it as a soft
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
mandate with gentler wording so I will
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
support the amendment but I still
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
consider it something that will lower
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
the investment on returns my other
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
minor nitpicking is that we don't
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
represent the cities or the towns we
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
represent the residents of the State
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
directly and they are the ones I'm
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about because they will end up
 
01:48:59.709 --> 01:48:59.719 align:start position:0%
having to take to pay higher taxes
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
because they will get less return on
 
01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.270 align:start position:0%
because they will get less return on
their

01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
investment and um to make a long story
 
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
short the last thing I'll say is that
 
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
there is this is not a all things being
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
equal if all things be were equal the
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
money would already be invested in state
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's not invested in the state because
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
there is more of a return to be made
 
01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:23.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere else by forcing part of it to
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
be invested in the state we are lowering
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
this returns and this is why I'm going
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment but oppose the
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you repres hle thank you Mr
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
chair um my question is is there an
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
interest by the committee as a whole for
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
an inim study on this I've heard it from
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
one person I'm aware of some others who
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
are supporting the amendment because it
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
makes the bill less bad but given that
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do significant policy in
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
an off year is interim study a better
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
motion and is it possible to see if that
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a majority to take that up right
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
now you would have to defeat the the
 
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
motion before us to take up another
 
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.470 align:start position:0%
motion before us to take up another
motion

01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
okay represent hacken Phillips thank you
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I was wondering if I could ask
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny if he could speak
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the origin um of the
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
six-month Sunset maybe you could it's
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
not six month um oh it's a sixe sun okay
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
that makes much more sense and I retract
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
representative grassy from yeah I I
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
think this is something this is first of
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
all I'm wondering why this didn't go to
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce instead of here it should have
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
went to Commerce first to have the
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
banking division look at that and I
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
certainly if we've sent it interm study
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
that I was wonder if Commerce could
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
actually pick up the bill and study the
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill there in Commerce and develop
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
something because I think that would be
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place to have an interim
 
01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.589 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place to have an interim
study

01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
done representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
chair I do have a question question now
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to line 31 effective
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
date and then it proceeds to say section
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
four of this act shall take effect on
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
December 30th 2030
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
not U cease to take place on December
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
30th 2030 well that's typical the way
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
they write
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
repeals it refers to section 4 which is
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
so there are two effective dates in the
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill on the second page the remainder of
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
this act sh take effect upon its passage
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
so only the repeal section takes effect
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
on December 30th
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
2030 so further further questions
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
chairman and representative
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
Lane yeah I'm I'm in agreement with
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and Griffin on
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
this um this is policy that's been in
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
place since
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
1991 there's an advisory commit ittee
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
that helps the head of the program which
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
was for a long time the banking
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner last year we changed it to
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
the treasure but it helps them set
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
policy for these for this fund and that
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
committee includes two New Hampshire
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
bankers and so that committee is
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
perfectly um capable of implementing
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
this policy that's in this bill if they
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
think it's prudent the fact that they
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
haven't done so in 30 years tells me
 
01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not a good
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
idea um and so I don't think you know we
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
we specifically asked in committee we
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
asked the treasurer is there a sense
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
that there's something wrong with this
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
fund that needs to be fixed and she said
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
no you know that that it it it's not a
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
case of something you know broken that
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed so and all the people
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
that came to testify who actually have
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
money in the fund are happy with it and
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't want changes so so I again I'm I'm
 
01:52:58.750 --> 01:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
in I'll vote for the amendment but not
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bill itself repres Lane um thank you
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
I get I want to go back to line 21 on
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
the comment uh that was made I think was
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards I I do think it's important to
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
make it up to uh 30% because that is the
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
ceiling if you say less than you can't
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
go below 30 that so that is requiring
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
them to invest in 30% and I don't think
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
intent um of the compromise but I I
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure but I I would say um
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
while I'm favoring in general this
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
amendment I I can't vote for it as
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
written unless somebody can explain to
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
me that I'm wrong which I often am so
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Sweeney will exempt
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for the question
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
so it it the full phrase does start with
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
the investment advisor selected by the
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
state treasurer and advisory committee
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
shall strive to maintain no less than
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
30% of the funds the the phrasing shall
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
strive is what makes it the
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
encouragement certainly no less or up to
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
or after the sh strive feel
 
01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
interchangeable at that point there's no
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
requirement in the law that it be 30%
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
the striving is the encouragement is to
 
01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
get to no less than 30% but is not
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
required mandated or there's no and
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty to anyone if it
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to there it's simply
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging them uh yes it's encouraging
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
no less than 30% it's a take down from
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
where it was at 100% in the original
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill um so it's just to get to that
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
encouragement level but with the with
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
the wording shall strive it makes this
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill encouragement not a mandate uh the
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
only thing that is that is required is
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
in the second uh subparagraph 2 be where
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
the investment advisor selected by the
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
state treasur and advisory committee
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
shall achieve and maintain the highest
 
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
attainable rating for stable value local
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
government investment pools that is the
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
requirement that's in the bill the
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
section above is the encouragement uh
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislative intent thank you does that
 
01:55:12.589 --> 01:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
answer your question all right follow up
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair wait a minute there's
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
a follow up for her question then I'll
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
come to
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
you um uh thank you representative
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
Sweeney I guess I would um respectfully
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
disagree with you um because when
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's parsing the words I think the
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
goal at least that I understood was to
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
invest up to and I know and it would be
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
striving to be up to so um I I have some
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
concerns with that uh part of it and my
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought was if if it doesn't change the
 
01:55:52.069 --> 01:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
meaning to you to say up to could we I I
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
know we've amended this thing to death
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
but if we do that amend it and then also
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
change correct the the
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
um the uh effective date uh at the last
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.669 --> 01:56:12.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow representative Griffin thank
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair all other things being
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
equal it seems to me that the state
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
treasurer and the and the advisory
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee would try and keep Investments
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
within the state particularly if the
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
returns were the same so I think this is
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
the bill and the all these amendments is
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
redundant I think either we should study
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
the bill make it on interim study or
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
just defeat it we really don't need it
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
we know that the uh
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
Treasurer has uh only recently taken
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
over control the treasurer's office and
 
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
she test testified that they are
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
currently reviewing policies with the
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and um I think we
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
should let that process work its way out
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
the people already have the ability to
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
invest as they see fit in New Hampshire
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine that they wouldn't
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
if they were getting the same returns
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
safety represent Edwards on R and rotate
 
01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um 48 hours ago I
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
would have wanted to have said exactly
 
01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
what representative Griffin has said and
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
in the course of some phone calls and
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
and discussion with colleagues I respect
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh I I was willing to do this on a
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
limited trial basis for five years see
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
how it works out but I really had it in
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
my head that it was a sealing of 30% and
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
and I I and I understand the power of
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
the strive to comment I get that but it
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
still seems to me like it's sending an
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
opposite guidance message than the one I
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
intended to have us send and and so I I
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
think I I'm I'm I don't really want to
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
support this amendment as written and I
 
01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
apologize if I fail to communicate to
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
that but uh interim study would also be
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll support the amendment I
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
understand the up to or no less than but
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
change and I do think that this is a
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
good option for New Hampshire because it
 
01:58:39.069 --> 01:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
keeps the money
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
here what to me if the interest rates
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire are not competitive
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
enough then the treasury has the option
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
to go elsewhere but I think giving the
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
chance for New Hampshire to have this
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
These funds and use them to build upon
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
the state is a great idea and I would
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
support and I hope that people will look
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
at it that way and this is an option we
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
are presenting an option that is good
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
state representative hacken Phillips
 
01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just um want to
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
allay some of the committee's
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
concerns as some as a former Banker
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
myself I uh understand the important
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
importance of the community reinvestment
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
Act and the true trickle down benefits
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
to our community here in the state when
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
banks are putting more development funds
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
into their service areas now those
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
values of those properties that they
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
invest in create more tax revenues for
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
our communities and that trickles into
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
the state so we can provide more
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
services so there is a secondary perhaps
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
uncatchable um benefit you know it's
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard to quantify that um
 
02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
immediately but we do know from the
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
folks um who have really run the numbers
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
and reported on this issue that there is
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
a huge un you know potential benefit to
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
to our state that can come as a
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
secondary benefit from whatever
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
perceived minor or um you know di
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
Minimus loss of investing from you know
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
moving those investments from out of
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
state to into state so you know I really
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
think that the sky will not fall if we
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
in fact undertake this opportunity um I
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
do think that the timing of the six-year
 
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
you know trial is a responsible amount
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
of time to see if this is something that
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
can take hold and benefit our state I
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
believe we would see that secondary
 
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
benefit within that time period um and
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I have overheard observed the the
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
treasur speaking with the prime sponsor
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill talking about the
 
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
importance of sending the policy
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee a piece of legislation that
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
gives them direction to try to strive
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
for this 30 percentile um or some
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
threshold amount for for the state for
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
these Investments so you know that's an
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
important signal to send to that
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee and to the treasurer so I
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
really believe that you know we should
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
not be sending this to interim study I
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
think this is something that we can act
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
on um immediately and um you know
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's up to our or at
 
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
least the 30% threshold I think is
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
really not critical I'm happy to defer
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
to the community on that or to the
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
committee on that um it's just this is a
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
really really strong opportunity for our
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
state to really sweep up some of the
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
benefit from the pp that is not
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
currently being realized in our state
 
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
because those Investments are going
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
frankly internationally so U for those
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
of us who have really dug into the Weeds
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
on the issue and
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the division who have really dug into
 
02:01:57.629 --> 02:01:57.639 align:start position:0%
this issue um I think we would be
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
missing a huge opportunity for
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
investment in our state if we just put
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
this into inam study I think you know
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
every day is critical and this money
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
could really be put to use for our state
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I I hope the committee will um I
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
hope they will see that secondary
 
02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
benefit and vote with it okay I've got
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh three people waiting to comment
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative papovich then
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative cabri kemell and then
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative GR
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um to make a long story short
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
there were comments made that we need to
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
give New Hampshire investment opportuni
 
02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
is a chance I can assure you that they
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
are having this chance right
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
now I mean there is nothing preventing
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
the PDP from investing in New Hampshire
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
if the returns in New Hampshire are
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate the point of the PDP PDP is
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to give municipalities an option to make
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
a slightly higher interest trade by
 
02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
assuming a slightly higher amount of
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
risk because the insurance are not
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
collateralized and or guaranteed or
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
insured the current Amendment which I
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
will support it because it's less bad
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
than the current
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be worthy to say at least
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
30% and why not 100% to be fair because
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
once you say no less than 30% there is
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
no upper limit look the opportunity that
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
we are missing here is the opportunity
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
to force the municipalities to take a
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
lesser amount of return on their
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
investment and therefore it's an
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to burden our taxpayers a
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more but boy will we feel
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
good about it so I would appreciate if
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh people tell you that in investment
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are all those unquantifiable and
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
unmeasurable benefits to remember that
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
you can always always count dollars and
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
cents and that our job when we give
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
these opportunities to invest to our
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and therefore our
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
citizens is to not chain them with so
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
many rules that they cannot make any
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
returns because we want to micromanage
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
where the money
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
goes in the interest of brevity I will
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
stop here if anybody wants to spend a
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
pleasant hour in the hallway I'll be
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
expand representative camell thank you
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think we're overthinking it
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
this is simply an encouragement
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment there is no mandate here not
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
even a soft mandate and I got to think
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
with currently 0% of the fund being
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
invested in New Hampshire there's got to
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of room there to look at
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and even if this does
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
nothing more than get in the future 5%
 
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
investment 10% investment in New
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a good thing and again
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's strictly an encouragement Amendment
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
and I will be supporting it
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative grassy no yeah the just
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
just two things I'd like to point out Mr
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
chairman first of all most of the larger
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
cities in this state you know some of
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
them use the pool some of them don't use
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
the pool because they have their own
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
Financial invest advisers and so this is
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the smaller mostly for the smaller
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
towns to be able to pull their money
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
together that's why it's called the pool
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
but I think that the thing that's that's
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
important to to think about here is that
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
this will really not impact anything
 
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
until next year because there's a
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
current contract that's out with the
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
investment advisors that we currently
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
have that will come up next year we have
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
time to put this into interim study to
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
study it and have a bill that will come
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
in that will direct them any changes for
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
next year in the in the meantime the
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
state treasurer and the advisory panel
 
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
that over that oversees this can can
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
work on regulations and take a look at
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
what these changes are for the next
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
contract what we're doing here is is
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
doing something that's going to impact
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
the next contract which I think is like
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
next March or June I'm not sure exactly
 
02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the date but we have time to impact
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
that by submitting legislation in the
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
fall and you know so so doing this now
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
will not do anything next month or two
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
months from now or three months from now
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in the next contract
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and what it what we can do is we can
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
study this and we can work with the
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
treasurer and we can meet with the
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
advisory panel and see or the Commerce
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
Committee can meet with them to make
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
good recommendations for good
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislations if we need it we may not
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
need it as most of the people said when
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
they were here if it ain't broke don't
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
fix it and it isn't broken
 
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
fix it and it isn't broken
representative

02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman I
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
believe in the people of New Hampshire I
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
believe in their
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
communities I believe in their
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
future and I believe in order to have a
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
bright and shiny future for New
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we need to in make the
 
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we need to in make the
necessary

02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
Investments and I was going to give my
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
support to the original bill but the
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Sweeny has
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
provided to us today I think makes it
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
even better because it's only an
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
encouragement for communities to
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
consider investing back into New
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think by investing back
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
you make our future you guarantee our
 
02:07:25.229 --> 02:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
future a brighter uh a brighter one
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman I'm afraid
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
that a number of members are misreading
 
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment as compared to the
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
original Bill if you look at the
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
original bill on line page one line 8
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
one of the phrases invested or deposited
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire that's
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
the geographical thing is actually
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
missing from from the amendment so the
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
amendment no longer requires These funds
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
to be invested or deposited within the
 
02:08:02.189 --> 02:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the key line that
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
is the same in both is actually in the
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
amendment line 22 insured or
 
02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
amendment line 22 insured or
collateralized

02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
collateralized
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
deposits so that's the same as as in the
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
original Bill and that's the the part of
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment that pushes the money
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
into a bank because and and and
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
disallows other kinds of Investments say
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
commercial paper or money market funds
 
02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
commercial paper or money market funds
or

02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
whatever which are not insured or
 
02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
collateralized and that sort of the
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
source of of Greater returns is is
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
having I mean they're they're quite safe
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
but they're but they're not insured or
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
collateralized insured or collateralized
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
is what makes this A Bank in investment
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding but but
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
specifically it no longer says invested
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
or deposited within New
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Griffin many of
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
the comments uh we've heard here
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those in favor of the bill
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
operate under the assumption that of the
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
$700 million in the fund none of it is
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
invested in New Hampshire I'm afraid I
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly how much is but
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure a portion of the money is
 
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
invested in New Hampshire and by moving
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
this inm study we can get an answer to
 
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
this inm study we can get an answer to
that

02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
question further
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
okay are we ready for the
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
question the amendment before us is 1
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%

what they think of it in the senate for
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the Statewide vote on the interim we
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%

find out before we return to Senate Bill
 
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
45 Mr chairman yes I I can tell you what
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
my plan is I I spoke to um assistant
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Hennessy she's going
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
to speak to Senator gray about those
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
details right good but one thing we can
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
do and I'm we're going to draft an
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is to change the
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
$450,000 to a dollar and that way we can
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
pass it as a dollar and if at some later
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
time they they decide they want it they
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
can come back for a committee of
 
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
conference we can go back to
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
$450,000 so all right that's the that's
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it I I was mistaken
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
so you'll have that Amendment for
 
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we'll have that for tomorrow
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%

02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
5 representative Griffin is writing a we
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%

to discuss that now represent
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
we we haven't done anything on that one
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
yet have we no that's next all right Mr
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
chair we have three amendments we have
 
02:17:00.429 --> 02:17:00.439 align:start position:0%

all three out all on 591 yes I'll handle
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
out yes
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
um we've always had um issues relative
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
to uh the Youth Development Center in
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
division 3 why is it that it went to
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
three it was it was more in Department
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and and division one Justice
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
treasury are in there that division so
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we switched it over
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
there all right
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
go all right we got one lengthy one here
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
we can well most of that's
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated all right we'll take some
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
only Mr chairman I'm I'm personally only
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
planning to move Amendment 19 1911 if
 
02:18:53.549 --> 02:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
that's the one people want to
 
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
concentrate on so you won't be bringing
 
02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:04.359 --> 02:19:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
and just to explain 1911 briefly while
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
you're reading it eliminates paragraphed
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay everyone has 1911 in hand will
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
recognize representative McGuire to
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
explain it thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
um this bill Senate Bill
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
591 um allocates $60 million for the YDC
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
settlement fund uh that's on top of $100
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
million that was previously allocated
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it also makes quite a few changes to
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
the um to the procedures of the
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
settlement fund and and limits and
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
deadlines and things like that so what
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
we heard in committee was that the
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
original thought two I guess it was two
 
02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
years ago when when the100 million was
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
allocated was um that that was there's
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
some argument as to whether some people
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
may have thought that was all it was
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to be or that was a down payment
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever but what the what the
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General told us was that we
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
expect to be liable or we expect to pay
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
claims um
 
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
totaling roughly um $750 million on this
 
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
on this um matter that because there are
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
something like 1,500 victims and claims
 
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
have been averaging roughly a half
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars a piece so that works
 
02:21:21.630 --> 02:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
out $750 million so even if but this $60
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
million plus so far they've spent 85 so
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have 15 remaining so allocating
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
another 60 that's enough to carry us
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
through the end of the bium because uh
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
that would give us 75 the bill itself
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
has a limit on how much the state must
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
pay per per year and that's 75 million
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
so this carries this bill would carry us
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
through through the end of the
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
bium um the bill also creates a uh an
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
installment plan kind of scenario so
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
that so that um victims will be paid you
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
know so much per year until they're
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
fully paid um with a 5% interest rate on
 
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:16.150 align:start position:0%
fully paid um with a 5% interest rate on
unpaid

02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
unpaid
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
funds um what does my Amendment do so um
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
my amend
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment um eliminates paragraph
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
14 um which is found I think on page 14
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill um and that's the paragraph
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
that allows us to borrow money to pay
 
02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:37.550 align:start position:0%
that allows us to borrow money to pay
this

02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
settlement right so one thing I did talk
 
02:22:43.469 --> 02:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
about when we were had this in committee
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
was in in division was that it's
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I think to borrow money to
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
pay operating expenses and so uh you
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
know this you might consider this in a
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
gray area I just don't think I think
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's fine to borrow money to build a
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
prison to build roads to do Capital
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
costs but I don't see settling lawsuits
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
as as capital costs and so uh this would
 
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate the possibility that money is
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
borrowed to pay this
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
claim and I'm happy to answer questions
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
members for representative
 
02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.429 align:start position:0%
members for representative
Maguire

02:23:26.429 --> 02:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
motion representative Lehman thanks Mr
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
chairman have you run this amendment by
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Attorney
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
General um thank you for the question no
 
02:23:40.750 --> 02:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
just the speaker and those those type of
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
people okay but but one thing one thing
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
I I did it I did hear from um the
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general and actually it's not
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's the Assistant Attorney General I've
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
been talking to about this is that the
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
whole bill is is a result of um is a
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
result of negotiation between the state
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys for the plaintiffs and
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
and so um and so a lot of the details
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
here um are are result of that
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
negotiation I we I considered other
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
changes in particular I think the the 5%
 
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
interest rate is a bit high and I would
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
change that to something lower but um
 
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's presumably a negotiation item the
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
exact way we come up with what this
 
02:24:37.469 --> 02:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
amendment changes is that we're not
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
borrowing money I mean that's that's
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
strictly our business it you know the
 
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
way we come up with funds that's up to
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
us that's really not a subject of
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation further question
 
02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
representative em yeah thank you Mr
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
chairman I would also comment that the
 
02:24:58.349 --> 02:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
original uh position on this for
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs was that they could be paid
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
out over time going into this that was
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
part of their agreement is that they
 
02:25:06.429 --> 02:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
agreed they could be paid out over time
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
so we're not introducing anything new
 
02:25:14.349 --> 02:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Mooney is is your
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment could it be part of this one
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
or is it separate
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
um separate
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay question over here representative
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
grot thank you I have a question for
 
02:25:33.319 --> 02:25:34.710 align:start position:0%
grot thank you I have a question for
representative

02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire in regards to the attorney's
 
02:25:41.309 --> 02:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
fees uh line
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
33.33% yeah thank you for the question
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it reads as though my amendment is
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
doing that but it's just the way it's
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
drafted that's from the original bill um
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it and it is part of I I believe
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually existing law yes so so
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
that was part of their original the
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
original law that created the settlement
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
fund and so on the the reason it sort of
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
looks like it's part of the amendment is
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
because we're crossing off section 14
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
the very first paragraph and then we're
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
repeating all the following stuff as
 
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
though what used to be 15 is now 14 what
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
used to be 16 is now 15 and so on if you
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
see what I mean so um all that stuff at
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom is is from the bill and a lot
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
of it is from existing law apiz so the
 
02:26:39.150 --> 02:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
part that you are referring to is the
 
02:26:41.469 --> 02:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
very first PR lines four through eight
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's what's being removed by this
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendment right but okay thank
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
you represent Abel thank you thank you
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chair having not seen this
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment before considering that this
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
is an
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
unbelievably important uh bill that
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're discussing here
 
02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
i' I mean speaking for myself I mean I
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just really uncomfortable doing
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
something like this at the last minute
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
in executive session in
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
finance without at least an opportunity
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
to caucus or to just put it on hold for
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
a day and understand what this
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
does I don't know how others feel any
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
others U support that raise your hand if
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
you do
 
02:27:33.399 --> 02:27:35.309 align:start position:0%
you do
yes

02:27:35.309 --> 02:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to just say something
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
along those lines and that is the
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
alternative to amending the bill is
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I think and and the
 
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
problem with ought to pass is this is a
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
$60 million hit to the general fund and
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
if we just say ought to pass it it's
 
02:27:59.070 --> 02:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
going to go straight to the governor
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
this was not amended by the house and so
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
um and so they're they're potentially is
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
future negotiation over what what uh
 
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
burdens we can place at the on the
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
general fund at this time how much money
 
02:28:19.469 --> 02:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
we have and so on so if we don't amend
 
02:28:19.479 --> 02:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
we have and so on so if we don't amend
it

02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
that takes this particular Bill away out
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
of those negotiations whereas if we do
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment it can be they can ask for
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee of conference in that
 
02:28:31.630 --> 02:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference the total
 
02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
general fund can be considered and so
 
02:28:36.190 --> 02:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I think an amendment makes
 
02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
sense thank you okay representative able
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah just one other I mean if the
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
discussion is where the money comes from
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
and doesn't come from like whether it
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
should be bonded or not whether it's the
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund that I understand but I'm
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
just not there's all this other about
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
the nego the uh attorney general and the
 
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
the fees and you know it just seems
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated to the uh uneducated
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
eye I would say
 
02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't I can see where we might need
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
another amendment but maybe not this one
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
but I say that without the benefit of
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
much time to look or absorb this at all
 
02:29:20.399 --> 02:29:21.510 align:start position:0%
much time to look or absorb this at all
representative

02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
tki I was just curious if um I know that
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't introduced it yet but if
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney described what her
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment does it may help us in our
 
02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
deliberations of what to do with the
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
First Amendment all right let's
 
02:29:37.710 --> 02:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Mooney so she
 
02:29:39.389 --> 02:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
can describe her Amendment and the
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
reasons for it okay thank you Mr
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm referring to my
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's number
 
02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:48.070 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's number
2024

02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
2024
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
1891 h it's very brief and I'll give you
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
some background and describe it I was
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
here last term when the fund was created
 
02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I always had uh some discomfort with
 
02:30:02.349 --> 02:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was a
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
2year window to file claims two full
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
years now the argument was made by those
 
02:30:12.510 --> 02:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
who were advocating for that window that
 
02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
it was needed in order to properly
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
publicize the creation of the fund and
 
02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
then wait for claims to be filed it was
 
02:30:23.230 --> 02:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
brought to light that perhaps uh
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
claimants would be incarcerated perhaps
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
living in other states perhaps
 
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in other states so I
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
accepted that argument um it worked
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
claims have been filed uh we're seeing
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
numbers coming in so to my surprise in
 
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
591 the window is open another six
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
months with a deadline of June
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
2025 so my Amendment brings the deadline
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
to file a claim back to the law as it is
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
now and that is to close in December of
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
2024 again keeping the window of filing
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
a claim at two solid years no more thank
 
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
rotate if um we could go back to
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's Amendment
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
because I
 
02:31:24.269 --> 02:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
think I
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I understand what this says so
 
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph 14 now
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
says lines 16 through 18 the cost of
 
02:31:36.429 --> 02:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
administration of the fund and any costs
 
02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general which are
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
outside of the ordinary operational
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
expenses shall not be paid for from the
 
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
fund that's what he's saying and then
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
Amendments excuse me leaves what used to
 
02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
be paragraph 14 and 15 as paragraph 15
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
and 16 so really the part that is very
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
different is line 16 to 18 it's it's
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
just this part of
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
the of the amendment that is different
 
02:32:10.349 --> 02:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
from the original bill would you say m
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question
 
02:32:21.359 --> 02:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question
so

02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.349 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:26.359 --> 02:32:28.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
the yeah so so if you look at the
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
original Bill page 14 or maybe you don't
 
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
have it in front of you um oh okay so
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's the issue
 
02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:40.990 align:start position:0%
that's the issue
um

02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
so the original bill in section
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
14 crossed off this stuff on line 4
 
02:32:50.349 --> 02:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
through eight
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
okay it
 
02:32:52.399 --> 02:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
okay it
added

02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
added
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
um it added stuff that's not on this
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
page right it added a whole paragraph
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
about borrowing
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
money okay it it used to say in the it
 
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
says in the bill to provide additional
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
funds not otherwise appropriated the
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
state treasurer is hereby authorized to
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
and shall upon approval of joint fisc
 
02:33:16.269 --> 02:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
and governor and counsel borrow on the
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
credit of the state for the purpose and
 
02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
for said purpose May issue bonds and
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
notes and so on right so that was the
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
borrowing part okay the stuff that you
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
see on lines 4 through eight was
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
actually the cross outs that was in the
 
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
bill those were cross outs in the bill
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
the stuff on nine through 16 those cross
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
outs were in the bill all the stuff at
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bottom the cost of administration
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
all that stuff was in the bill see what
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
I mean so this amendment is eliminating
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
something from the bill that's not on
 
02:33:49.359 --> 02:33:50.710 align:start position:0%
something from the bill that's not on
this

02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
page okay it's it's on Page in the bill
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's on page 14 lines 20 through 26 and
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's all about borrowing it's not about
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything else someone from the lab just
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
generously loaned me their version and I
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
understand now thank you um as long as
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here I i' so that answers your
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
question yeah so let me let me speak to
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
um representative money's Amendment
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
which has my name on it because because
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
I was uh I was um contemplating it and
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
and it made sense to me but this is
 
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
something I did explicitly talked to the
 
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office about and they
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
told me that this is the result of the
 
02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
the the extension six months is a result
 
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
of negotiation and furthermore it was
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
something the Attorney General wanted
 
02:34:47.550 --> 02:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
was this extension because because this
 
02:34:51.630 --> 02:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
deadline is deadline for getting into
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
the settlement pool not a deadline for
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
filing a lawsuit right so if we short
 
02:35:01.309 --> 02:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
keep the deadline for getting a
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
settlement that means and and some cases
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
that could have been settled instead go
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
to lawsuit that's quite expensive for
 
02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
the state we have to hire attorneys and
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so on and go to court and time it's
 
02:35:17.550 --> 02:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
time consuming and all that so um so
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is something and and the other
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
thing the attorney told me was that the
 
02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
fact that this bill is making a whole
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of changes to the policy of the
 
02:35:30.269 --> 02:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
settlement fund it takes them you know
 
02:35:34.349 --> 02:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
once this passes in June um it'll take
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
them into August to create new um new
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
rules and and new policies for the
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
settlement fund that matched the bill so
 
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
that the the attorneys for the
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs cannot talk to their clients
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
until like August and so and to and to
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
explain to them here's one of your
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
options take the settlement and so and
 
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
so it it's there's so many clients that
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
it that the that's why these attorneys
 
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
want extra time to to for for the for
 
02:36:11.309 --> 02:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
the uh for them to speak to those
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
clients rather than just the four months
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year right so that
 
02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why they want the
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
extension so I'm I'm personally not
 
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
going to vote for representative money's
 
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you representative
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
walner thank you representa Maguire just
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
said a lot of the things I wanted to say
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
but I mean the reason we set the
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
settlement fund up to begin with was so
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
that claimants could go through that
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
process and not through what potentially
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
could be a much more expensive process
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
of going to court so giving six
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
additional months makes a lot of sense
 
02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
in being able to get um our CLA claims
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
in and um the um correct forms and
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
paperwork filed I am not going to V I am
 
02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
not going to vote for representative
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
Mooney's um Amendment but I'm also not
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to vote for representative
 
02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
Maguire's Amendment
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I've spent quite a bit of time over
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
the last several years working on this
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
um I know that this was very carefully
 
02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:25.990 align:start position:0%
um I know that this was very carefully
crafted

02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
crafted

working on this bill along with the

Attorney General's office um and I did
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
not hear I did not hear from the
 
02:37:46.269 --> 02:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general that he was looking for
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
any changes to the bill and that he felt
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
that there was any need for amendments
 
02:37:53.389 --> 02:37:53.399 align:start position:0%

so here's the
 
02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
plan here we are as the finance
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee we work to get we worked on
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
all these bills in this
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee these are the ones that
 
02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
committee these are the ones that
passed

02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
so if they're well supported by this
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee I want your
 
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
priorities so six you can give me six
 
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
number ones and 12 number twos then I'm
 
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to look at all the number ones and
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go see the Senate finance
 
02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
committee and say
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
okay here's the ones we really have
 
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
priority if we don't get them you may
 
02:45:06.269 --> 02:45:06.279 align:start position:0%
see them two or three more times as
 
02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendments to whe the bills you
 
02:45:11.790 --> 02:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
like so that's the way I want to proceed
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
but I want to feel that the committee
 
02:45:17.110 --> 02:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
has some input to this that it's not
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
just my ideas but and and you may decide
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
it by the the amount of money or you may
 
02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
decide it by the how you felt about the
 
02:45:28.910 --> 02:45:28.920 align:start position:0%

02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:53.160 align:start position:0%

02:46:19.389 --> 02:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
front of me right we get six we get to
 
02:46:21.870 --> 02:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
select six for a number one and six for
 
02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
a number two and the balance for number
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
three well 12 for number two thank you
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and all the rest are threes and you
 
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to you don't have to score
 
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
everyone if you're not that interested
 
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
you might just give me your top ones or
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's up to you but I'll be I'll be
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the the ones that get number
 
02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
ones I'll be scoring them all up
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire are these Anonymous or
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
would you like our name on if you want
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
to write your name that'd be fine if I
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
you I didn't they didn't leave room for
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
your name but I would appreciate
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
it room at the bottom and any comments
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
where you say if I don't get this I'll
 
02:47:06.190 --> 02:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
kill somebody or something extreme
 
02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
but you know there obviously that
 
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
there's some that we on this committee
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
have put a lot of effort into some of
 
02:47:15.070 --> 02:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
these bills and I don't like to see the
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
way the Senate's treating them represent
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
H um
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair but there's a huge
 
02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of the spending for
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
several of these and should we be
 
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
encouraged to start looking at how to
 
02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
get to a total below a certain dollar
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
value because two of these are the bulk
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
of this by themselves yeah some of these
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
are all the money all and so what I'm
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
looking at is there's if there's
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
something under a million dollars and
 
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
there's I've probably mentioned to you
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
before that I went to an arpa meeting
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
where I just was was me and the speaker
 
02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
and couple of senators and and the uh
 
02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
head of the budget and head of of gopher
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so on where they have
 
02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
had arpa money that must be spent so
 
02:48:03.790 --> 02:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
some of the projects that began
 
02:48:05.950 --> 02:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
initially to be funded by arpa either
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
were cancelled or were delivered for
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
less money or
 
02:48:13.230 --> 02:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
had got discouraged for whatever reason
 
02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
some of that money is still here so when
 
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
I looked at went to the arpa meeting
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
here's three bills that you will see
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the Amendments that have been
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
prepared that the Senate has already put
 
02:48:27.309 --> 02:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
ARA money one of those that you might
 
02:48:30.269 --> 02:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
remember is the Hamstead property tax
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
they put that in the
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
um in the ARA money a fear that we
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approve it and there was a
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
couple others that escaped me for the
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
moment but I'll talk tell you tomorrow
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
so anyway if they're going to get arpa
 
02:48:46.750 --> 02:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
money for their bills I want arpa money
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
for our bills so your money your choices
 
02:48:53.230 --> 02:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
that come high on the priority list and
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
like like we know $50 million is going
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be a tough one but a million dollar
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
$2 million 100,000 200,000 that might be
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
there in the arpa money so I'm going to
 
02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
go to the AR I'm going to go to the U
 
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
head of the budget there Jim gear and
 
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
say okay give me these bills as many as
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
you can take take this money and and
 
02:49:18.429 --> 02:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
give me some more out of arpa we may
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
meet as late from what he said as next
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
November before we know how much of this
 
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
arpa money so some of these things may
 
02:49:28.950 --> 02:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
not be funded right away but if the
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
Senate mistreats them and they don't get
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
passed uh there's another shot that
 
02:49:36.269 --> 02:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
we've never had before so why don't you
 
02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
all know about that and and wanted your
 
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
input before I just go well I like this
 
02:49:42.429 --> 02:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
one the hell with everybody else that's
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
not me um want the input of this
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee we all work together on this
 
02:49:50.110 --> 02:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
and so when I see what you like and I
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
like and we all like together we're
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
going to go forward to arpa and say hey
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
here's some we'd like to have funded
 
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
arpa funds it's not a done deal but it's
 
02:50:02.190 --> 02:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
maybe better than what we're left with
 
02:50:05.269 --> 02:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
at the time because these add up to a
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
couple hundred million or some of the
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the bills between the house and the
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and there isn't that much money
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the Surplus fund so I
 
02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
was delighted to hear there's a little
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
bit more in the in the arpa it might be
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
into the millions it might be into the
 
02:50:24.269 --> 02:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
tens tens of millions if that's the case
 
02:50:25.870 --> 02:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
the money would either just lapse back
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the federal government or we could
 
02:50:30.429 --> 02:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
use it for something that we
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
all you give me a vote telling me what
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
you like representative PRI thank you Mr
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
chairman what about the projects that we
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
are deliberating today and tomorrow they
 
02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't appear on this table and some of
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
them have a cost significant
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
cost since the Senate has already
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
already shown the ones they wanted to
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
support in the arpa funds I figur they
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
their priority they've taken three of
 
02:50:58.510 --> 02:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
the ones that we've done and and we
 
02:51:00.269 --> 02:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
haven't done final knowledge on but I
 
02:51:02.429 --> 02:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
will I will show you tomorrow by
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendments the three that they have
 
02:51:06.910 --> 02:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
given alternate fundings and we won't
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
have to worry about but the Senate bills
 
02:51:14.349 --> 02:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
if we like them we'll pass them and but
 
02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm fearful the other side isn't
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
treating our house bills with the same
 
02:51:20.229 --> 02:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
respect that some of you have gone into
 
02:51:23.309 --> 02:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
their committee meetings they're given
 
02:51:24.910 --> 02:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
10 minutes A
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
bill they're not even paying attention
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
to you they're looking at something else
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
then then they vote and some of the
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
bills that they've sent to us is at
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
first reading you see contradictions
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
within them didn't they read this I'm
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
afraid they didn't so we've amended
 
02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
things that were obvious to us and tried
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
to fix them and uh you know
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm I just need another tool to
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate with them and so since we work
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
as a committee I want the committee inut
 
02:52:00.399 --> 02:52:01.630 align:start position:0%
as a committee I want the committee inut
representative

02:52:01.630 --> 02:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman one of my
 
02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
favor seems to be a l lost from the list
 
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
436 that was the $50 million for the uh
 
02:52:12.399 --> 02:52:15.070 align:start position:0%
436 that was the $50 million for the uh
unfunded

02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:16.710 align:start position:0%
unfunded
liability

02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
um ahuh but um I know that they have
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
already decided the uh either itl or
 
02:52:27.309 --> 02:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
interim study on that one um and I would
 
02:52:32.229 --> 02:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
point out um uh House Bill 1656 the
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
third highest one here special education
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
that one I know their committee voted 3
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
to one for for interim study ah so um if
 
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
we decide that that's a high priority
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's one we're going to have to attach
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
to some other Senate Bill next week
 
02:52:50.229 --> 02:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
as a floor
 
02:52:55.469 --> 02:52:55.479 align:start position:0%

so it'll be the it'll be the week after
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
which will give us time to get some of
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
these things done so that's why I'm I'm
