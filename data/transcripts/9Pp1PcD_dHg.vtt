00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
good morning yeah we're now calling the
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
order the community conference on house
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill 180 and act
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
increasing the penalty for buyers under
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
the laws regarding trafficking and
 
00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
the laws regarding trafficking and
reversals

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
anyone just open up for discussion
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
um sometimes the sponsor of the
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
millennial has a couple of questions
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i guess the question for the house is
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
what is the difference in the age
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
you have a section that says three years
 
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
you have a section that says three years
difference

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's on the second page um
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
what if the age is more than
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
are you referring to roman numeral three
 
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
are you referring to roman numeral three
b

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes on the on the second pass by the
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
seven okay
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
by the house oh by the heart by the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
house right
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay well i can't answer the part that
 
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
okay well i can't answer the part that
says

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
um for the person who's 13 years of age
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
or older
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
and under 16 years of age and the actor
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
is 20 years of age or under
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
the age difference between the actor and
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
the other person is not
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
more than three years so if it's more
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
than three years
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
then this section that section
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
would not have applied so then it would
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
revert back
 
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
revert back
in

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
the idea behind that was that the
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
mindset of someone who is let's say 18
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
or 19
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
it may be different than some if they
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
were to solicit someone
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
who was 15 or 16 as opposed to someone
 
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.069 align:start position:0%
who was 15 or 16 as opposed to someone
who's

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
50 years old both of those are illegal
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
should remain illegal their crimes and
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
they're both supporting the market for
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
human trafficking
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's just the mindset of nine people
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
like presumably
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
different than that of uh 40 50 we'll
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
say 37
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's something it's not i think it's a
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
different offense
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's the same offense but i think if one
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
is more egregious than the other but
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
my understanding that that that
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
provision was
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
taken out and moved by the senate right
 
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:45.990 align:start position:0%
taken out and moved by the senate right
and

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
i i'm having conversations with
 
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.150 align:start position:0%
i i'm having conversations with
different

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
different members that are sitting here
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
today and some people outside this
 
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
today and some people outside this
community

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
i understand why taking it out it's
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
my point may be valid and logical
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's also makes sense to also not have
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
it in there because
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
again it it's still a crime i said this
 
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.110 align:start position:0%
again it it's still a crime i said this
in

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
the committee hearing in the house
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
criminal justice public safety committee
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
buyer beware
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
exactly um as far as the senate version
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
my question is the class a relates to
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
trafficking victims under the age of 16
 
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.509 align:start position:0%
trafficking victims under the age of 16
correct

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay um
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
so 16 and 17 year old victims then
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
fall into the class b felony uh 17 and
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
18. and it
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
revolves around the age of consent
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
because the age of consent is 16.
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
um we had some difficulty with
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
13 years and and that three year time
 
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
13 years and and that three year time
period

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
because we felt that there are children
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
that are younger the age younger than
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
the age of 13 that are also trafficked
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why in the new section b
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
we changed it to a class a felony and we
 
00:16:59.519 --> 00:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
we changed it to a class a felony and we
have

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the person who is under the age of
 
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.430 align:start position:0%
for the person who is under the age of
16.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
16.
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
um and we wanted the harsher penalty for
 
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:06.470 align:start position:0%
um and we wanted the harsher penalty for
that

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not capable legally
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
capable and you could even argue
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
intellectually capable of consenting
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
to to to a sex act with
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
an older person um or even um
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
you could even say you know someone
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
who's 18 or older
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
um the first one we we kept the class b
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
felony because of the age of consent you
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
you do
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
you can give the your consent at that
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
particular point in time
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to uh to consent even though you are
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
being trafficked
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
you can saying
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes or no i'm not going to do that so we
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
our emphasis was really on the 16
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
and younger because of the age of
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:58.630 align:start position:0%
and younger because of the age of
consent

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and the cargo didn't really make
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
sense to us because
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
you know again we're talking about
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
trafficking as you know this is not
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
these are relationships uh and so the
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
cargo really didn't
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
make sense uh based on what you're
 
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.830 align:start position:0%
make sense uh based on what you're
talking

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
again if we're talking about a 17 year
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
old victim then we're talking about
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that they the offender would be
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
charged with the process being filmed
 
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.029 align:start position:0%
charged with the process being filmed
correct

00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then the other question um why was
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
the removal of the section on the
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
an actor by not knowing the age
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
of the person that they can
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
cannot use that as a defense because
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
that was where i worked on
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
several years ago and i just feel that
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
um like daryl said
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
this fire yeah i see that yeah we buy
 
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
this fire yeah i see that yeah we buy
everywhere

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
yeah we we do have that in the first
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
section right but not in the second
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
so does that mean it's time like a
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
little second section maybe that is
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
something that we can talk about
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we can we can add that to
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
the second step no
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think that was a drafting sort of yeah
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
it might have been a drafting and also
 
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.470 align:start position:0%
it might have been a drafting and also
um

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
i mean you should know if someone's
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
16 or younger i mean granted there are
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of adults and young adults
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
or teenagers and this applies to both
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
men and women although we usually just
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
think of women being trafficked
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh young boys are also trapped as well
 
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
uh young boys are also trapped as well
um

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
that they you should know
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
you should know anyone between the ages
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
of 17 you
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
really should but if you have a 10 year
 
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
really should but if you have a 10 year
old

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
i mean come on you you know that that
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
person is not capable of giving consent
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
even up to the age of 16 which is the
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
legal age of consent
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
that you really should know who you're
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
having a sexual
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
sexual contact with that
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
but anyway that's but i do think that
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps um
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was an oversight that and we can
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
in an amendment to put that in there as
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
well right because
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
my feeling was you know like daryl says
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
sending representatives
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
that buyer beware is definitely
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
and the other part of it is is the fact
 
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
and the other part of it is is the fact
that

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're committing an offense when you're
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
buying sex with
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
anybody in the state of new hampshire
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so you've already broken the law so
 
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.029 align:start position:0%
so you've already broken the law so
therefore

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
to use as a defense that you didn't know
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
the age of
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
the person you had sex with i don't
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
think that should be allowed
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
to the event because they've already
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
broken the law and this
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
is just this step is even more egregious
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
what we what we really concentrated on
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
was the fact that
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
we felt that there should be stricter
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
penalties for children for someone
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
trafficking children and someone who
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
buys sexual services from a child
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
um rather than someone who is legally
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh give their consent right so i
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair we would have um no problem
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
in adopting a compromise amendment
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
putting the language neither the actor's
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
lack of knowledge of the other person's
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
age nor consent to the other person
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
shall constitute a defense to a charge
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would support that any any other
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts or considerations
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
no i don't know i just i just wanted to
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
say though
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that anybody who has been trafficked i
 
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:49.029 align:start position:0%
that anybody who has been trafficked i
mean

00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it stays with that person
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
for life yes and so you know we don't
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
want to minimize
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
because of ages we want to acknowledge
 
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
because of ages we want to acknowledge
that

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's egregious no matter what age of the
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
child so that is
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
just something i needed to say okay
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just point out that i think that
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
again this is a fair compromise between
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
both divisions here so let's see
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
if i wear this correctly if i don't wear
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
this right someone correct me so it's
 
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.830 align:start position:0%
this right someone correct me so it's
efficient

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
so the house is not we're not receiving
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
our position of non-concurrence but
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
with the senate amendment but we will
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
concur with a an amendment
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
that addresses paragraph three
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
b roman numeral 3b that takes the
 
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
b roman numeral 3b that takes the
language

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
that um neither the actor
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
neither the actor's lack of knowledge of
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
the other person's age
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
or nor consent of the other person shall
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
constitute defense to recharge
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
into this paragraph provided that there
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that simply
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
adds that provision from number 3b uh
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
the house would then
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.840 --> 00:40:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
you all ready to rock roll yes morning
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
we will now call the
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that originally passed in
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the house that was then
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
subsequently amended by the senate
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
before we again would just start by
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
letting everyone introduce themselves
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%

representing rockingham county
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
distributed and i think just to begin
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
we'll start with
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
if someone could explain the immense
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been added to the
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
original book
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman um this
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
bill was a little problematic for us
 
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
bill was a little problematic for us
because

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
we only had the testimony of front
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor we had
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
no no one from the legal community no
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
one from
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
advocates whether they were legal
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
advocates or children advocates
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
or nothing just that and we felt
 
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.349 align:start position:0%
or nothing just that and we felt
uncomfortable

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
with uh with the six years originally
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
i believe we we had moved this bill
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate but in talking
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
with some of my colleagues we decided
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay let's see what we can do
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
and so we brought in a floor amendment
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.349 align:start position:0%
and so we brought in a floor amendment
that

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
we said three years why don't we just do
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
so um in talking with my colleagues
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
what i would like to do is offer a
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
compromise to the house
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
in which we will have an amendment
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
which would if you look at
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
as introduced um section
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
one g not withstanding sub-paragraphs a
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%

for any offense under rsa 631-1
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
which are the serious offenses where
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
rape murder you know physical real
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
physical harm that we will go to the six
 
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.950 align:start position:0%
physical harm that we will go to the six
years

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
but force rsa 631-2
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
which is uh usually second-degree
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
assaults that we will go to
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
three years and that is the compromise
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
that compromise one of the the concerns
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
is that i don't believe
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
that a person that is a victim of these
 
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.589 align:start position:0%
that a person that is a victim of these
crimes

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily sometimes even
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
realizes or experiences the true effects
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
of this assault at the age of
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
21 or 22. and if you take a person that
 
00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:57.670 align:start position:0%
21 or 22. and if you take a person that
is

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
18 years old maybe recently graduates
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
college at 19
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
comes into the rural world per se a lot
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
of times
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's when these this kind of really
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
hits them like a sledgehammer
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
and they they kind of tend to go
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
backwards a little bit into a shell
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
and also that is whenever they have the
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
courage more
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
to come out to talk about what has
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
really happened
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it almost feels like well if you
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
didn't do it in time
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
then the punishment isn't as extreme so
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
i i feel very strongly and i know our
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee felt very strongly
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
in about the six years and i just don't
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
think that it should make a difference
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um what was done what was done is was
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
not okay
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
period and i would i would just really
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you to think about
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
the thing about that our concern
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
was that the further you get away from
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
the incident
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
the more difficult it's going to be to
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
prove um
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
memory issues um other people that
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
were involved the other the other person
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
are the people
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
that were involved i mean it just
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
becomes harder it
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
just becomes much harder and so
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
um we felt you know just based upon the
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
testimony we had
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
we understand that we know that there
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
are times we
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
have depressed memories um they don't
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
realize what happened to them
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
at that particular time but again we did
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
not get the testimony that we needed
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the legal uh from the legal
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
community and or
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh the other types of advocates so
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's why originally we just said look
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have the testimony we need
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
um we're just gonna itl this send a
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
message to the uh
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
talk to the prime sponsor but please
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
file this again
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
bring the people forward to talk with us
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
but again um in reflection we said okay
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
let's we'll we'll divide it in half
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
we'll go three years
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we did and so now
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're willing to go okay
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
for the really serious crimes we'll go
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
six years but for these
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
other types of the lesser crimes we'll
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
do three
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
as an effort of compromise
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think sort of thinking
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
you know i i see what you're saying in
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know when people will come to the
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
realization that something happened
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
and of course you know sometimes it
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen when they're outside
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
of their home right so sometimes someone
 
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:33.910 align:start position:0%
of their home right so sometimes someone
who

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
is a victim is under the care of a
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
relative and that's the perpetrator and
 
00:46:37.839 --> 00:46:38.390 align:start position:0%
relative and that's the perpetrator and
so

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know three years from the 18th
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
birthday does give them additional
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
three years to sort of the outcome or
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
even the legal
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
um that's the legal
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
provision of the the first of the
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think it is a compromise position i
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
think you know if we get additional
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
testimony next year about whether six
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
testimony next year about whether six
years

00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
were appropriate based on brain
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
development i think that would be really
 
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.790 align:start position:0%
development i think that would be really
important

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
to know the brain development of someone
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
from 18 but i think this is an
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate compromise
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's no good question for anyone sitting
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
here but
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the civil liability
 
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.109 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the civil liability
did

00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
last term i know there was a senate
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
it was a senate bill that would have
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
made it
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
had erased the status limitations on on
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
civil case for
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
sexual assault now
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think yeah
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think um i'm not sure if that was part
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
of an ominous bill or not
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i do remember um senate judiciary
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
had that
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was passed i'm gonna
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
take a chance here and say
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think it was part of an operative
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
spill that that
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think it initially was a stand-alone
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
that got then put into it
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic began not that
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
civil liability is necessarily justice
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
but at least that but there is no status
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
limitations on that
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
so like that person could still
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
have their their day in court and
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying money would solve the
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
problem but there's something to keep in
 
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
problem but there's something to keep in
mind

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
bringing the difference attention and i
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
think three years from the 18th birthday
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
is still like
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
so if i understand correctly the
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
proposal is
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
first degree assault that would be
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
moved back up to six years but ending
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
second degree
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree to that for compromise i
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
just feel
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
i just really have to say that i i don't
 
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
i just really have to say that i i don't
think

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
limiting a person when they're in this
 
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
limiting a person when they're in this
situation

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's almost telling them too bad so sad
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know you didn't come out soon enough
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
and in the whole culture that we're in
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the world that we're in now is to
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
encourage people and
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
to tell them that they're limited on
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
how long they have to to do this i mean
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
really hard for a person that is in that
 
00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.750 align:start position:0%
really hard for a person that is in that
situation

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
and you know where senator you made a
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
great point
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of these these people are in
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
it very well may have been a family
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
member maybe some in their own household
 
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
member maybe some in their own household
and

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
it takes them to get out of that so i i
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
almost feel like
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
telling them when you didn't do it in
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
time you know i
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
i personally should be any limit but i
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
recognize there needs to be
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
i would agree to a compromise because it
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
is better than nothing i just really
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
i need to say i just i really encourage
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
you to just
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
i could be longer not sooner but
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
last term there was a bill proposing
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the house it didn't make it out of
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
but i recall being i they would have had
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
no stash of limitations from
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
criminal offences i think that was
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
i was the not many people supported i
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
know i did
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm with you on expanding even
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
more but
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
i kind of tend to agree in the spirit of
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
compromise because what we have now if
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
we don't come from
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
what we have now is works i mean they'll
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
agree something needs to be done i agree
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone said that i think the more
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
serious offenses at least
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
that would be in six years and if
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
if at any point in time we think three
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
years is too short
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
of degree assaults i'll postpone
 
00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:58.390 align:start position:0%
of degree assaults i'll postpone
treatment

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
situation so i just have a question
 
00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.069 align:start position:0%
situation so i just have a question
about

00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's 26 the difference between three
 
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.309 align:start position:0%
there's 26 the difference between three
and

00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
going by the most serious events a
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
little less serious defense
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe misunderstanding when you need a
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
better understanding of what statute of
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
limitations does
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
if one of these crimes are committed
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
then the statute of limitations
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
basically i think protects the
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
perpetrator it seems like that's who
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
who by changing these uh number of years
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
it affects the perpetrator the victim
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
then is the opportunity to report that
 
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
then is the opportunity to report that
crime

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm having i agree i think it should
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
be longer rather than shorter
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't see really the need to
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i may i agree with you up to the
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
point that
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
if i got everything i asked for in every
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
single build the
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
laws would be very different i actually
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
agreed that i i would be
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
okay making it nine or even twelve
 
00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
okay making it nine or even twelve
because

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
nowadays with some of the technology we
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
have and some of the
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
dna databases that you're able to
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can always find the person
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
so and now we're dealing with miners
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're not even open enough to consent to
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
testifying so i i'm right there with you
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
i supposed to do nothing is worse than
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think the compromise is fair
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
considering that it's it's
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
first degree that assault sexual
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
assaults that's that's the serious most
 
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.430 align:start position:0%
assaults that's that's the serious most
serious

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
serious that's not the undermined second
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
degree that's also sierra's put out
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
i would be reluctant to let this one
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
slip away because
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
where we would be is back square one and
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm confident that our
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
what the committee the house criminal
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
justice public safety committee would do
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
but i see i see us repeating ourselves
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
sitting here again next year
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
i would not want to see the bill slip
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
away but i'm not sure that i agree
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
that compromise for the purposes of
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying we compromise
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
to get the legislation right that's the
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
only way to get it then
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's how we'll get it if you want to
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
try to convince
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
how we keep the four's yours
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
it they're very reasonable everyone
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're all reasonable here i understand
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's casual and i i mean you get
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
in a situation where you have some
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
some of this maybe within a family
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
repetitive or whatever it could affect a
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of money
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
i i just don't see a need to change the
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have a case you don't press
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
so i mean everybody's saying yeah i
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
think we should have higher ones but
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
just to compromise to save your company
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
last five but
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's what but
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
in fairness that if i thought the
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
compromise was
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable i wouldn't compromise i'm
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
not saying that i'm going to leave here
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
celebrating but at the same time i
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
i think the compromise is reasonable my
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
question was that
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative end of it my question
 
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.270 align:start position:0%
the legislative end of it my question
was

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
just to understand what i thought about
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
about station limitations i think they
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion
 
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.270 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion
[Music]

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's a different question right rather
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
we should have such a location yeah
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very different question
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to make the point
 
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:43.829 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to make the point
representative

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
we went from killing this bill to now
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're at the point where for the serious
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
offenses we agree to six years the less
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
serious offenses
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
will will go to three years so i think
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
the senate has
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
moved on our position a great deal uh
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's unfortunate that we just did
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
not get a lot of testimony on this bill
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
we just had the prime sponsor and that's
 
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
we just had the prime sponsor and that's
it

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
and just so everyone understands who's
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
following along
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
three years six years it may sound short
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
this is a tolling
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
statute location so you can have a it's
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
total it's a tolling status meaning
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical if you had a victim that
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
was 13
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
for the first once they reset 18 that's
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
when the clock starts
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
so it's it's precisely longer than three
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
longer than six and for you know good
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
reason that it's really been told
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's so it's you could be prosecuting or
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
trying to prosper someone
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
for an offense that happened 15 years
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
ago 10 years ago
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to i'm wondering if
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
for all children and minors
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
it said that your brain
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
during that period relies on mainly the
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
pottery brain with that
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
emotion so there's a lot of emotional
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
things tied up with that
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
it goes to a different part of your
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
brain and you get to be 25
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
most of the things you're doing are
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
emotional so it might be even something
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
about where
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
people at that age of 23
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
they remember the statute of limitation
 
00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:04.549 align:start position:0%
they remember the statute of limitation
somebody

00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
might not realize till at 23 or 24 that
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
what they thought was perfectly okay
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
or something figured out so
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a problem doing the
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
statute limitations because we did have
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of testimony
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
why why six years and another thing is
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we heard it as ludicrous as this
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
may sound
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
when this is happening to a child
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly normal to them they think
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
it's very normal that
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
that is their normalcy to us it's hard
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
to imagine
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
because it's just that ludicrous to them
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine years old you know i
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
worked in a school
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
you would be amazed how many
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
how many children think
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
if that's just that happens to everybody
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
so again once they once they reach a
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
certain age and they
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
start to experience more life and then
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's when things kind of start
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
hitting them left and right
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know a lot of these
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
people end up
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
having to resign from their jobs you
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
know live with their parents it's just
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's really really hard i just don't
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
think we should
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's something that you should can't
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
officially with the proposed amendment
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
which would i'll just say it again it
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
for for any first degree would change
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
from six years from
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
specialization six years from the 18th
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
birthday for any second degree
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
because if does anyone have any
 
00:58:55.839 --> 00:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
because if does anyone have any
objection

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
and we all would we also give that up
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
good morning we now call the order of
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the committee at conference on house
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill 296
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
an act establishing the crime of
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosures
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that passed the house that was
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
then amended
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
subsequently amended
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
all right but just before we get into
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we will now introduce the
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
senator carson i represent district 14.
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not representative allison that i
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
won i represent
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
nashua or hillsboro 32.
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative scott wallace rockingham
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
12 the town of danville
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative general rhodes represents
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
cheshire county district 15.
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative darryl abbess i represent
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
rockingham county district eight
 
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.310 align:start position:0%
rockingham county district eight
and

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
at this point i understand that there's
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment already prepared
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
so rather than maybe discuss what the
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
what was amended when it was in the
 
01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
what was amended when it was in the
other

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
branch uh we can just discuss the
 
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
branch uh we can just discuss the
amendments

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
does then have anyone had a chance to
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
so to sum it up what inspired this was
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
in both uh versions that passed
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
had language where in order to meet
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
their burden you have to
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
prove the intent to harass and
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
it was raised at least brought to our
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
attention that
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
to prove the intent to harass
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult to prove um
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
unless it was
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
something more of a repeat situation
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
so considering the offense would only
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
have been a violation offense
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
it was found that this law would have
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
actually been very harmful because it
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been something that was
 
01:21:36.639 --> 01:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been something that was
really

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
enforceable and although well intended
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
may have left some something to be
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
desired because it wasn't
 
01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:47.189 align:start position:0%
desired because it wasn't
accomplished

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
what i can just say from speaking with
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's not that law enforcement
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
officials won't enforce violations but
 
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.229 align:start position:0%
officials won't enforce violations but
that's

01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's a lower level offense it's
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
naturally going to be a lesser priority
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
so it is better to
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
for this to have at least be the
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level so what the amendment
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
does it makes the first offense
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
to be a misdemeanor it does not specify
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's a class a or a class b
 
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:09.990 align:start position:0%
whether it's a class a or a class b
misdemeanor

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
that would be at the discretion of the
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
county attorney
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
on how they wish to prosecute that
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
um the difference obviously being the
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
class b just
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
did not entail any uh jail time at least
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh if there were to be a second offense
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
presuming that
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
there was a the first offense there was
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
already a conviction
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh that would then elevate the charge to
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
the potential of a class d felony and
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
these have to do with when the loot
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
images are sent
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're unsolicited by the person
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
receiving them
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
and what this also does is it takes us
 
01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
and what this also does is it takes us
where

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
the recipient does not solicit the photo
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that recipient is a minor
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
that in of itself would then be a
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this does then it also has a
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
provision on the registration
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
for the uh criminal offenders um
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
it does add rsa 644.9-b
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
that i again we're talking about i
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
understand this may not be a physical
 
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.669 align:start position:0%
understand this may not be a physical
act

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's still a backup
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
involving loot images being especially
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
involved in a minor
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with that
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
especially protection
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
i have a hard time objecting to that
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i'll open up for discussions of
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
hey um mr chairman i'm just looking here
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
from senator um
 
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.189 align:start position:0%
from senator um
[Music]

01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the i i i can see what this amendment is
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
my concern is with the registration um
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
so if someone's convicted of them guilty
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
of a misdemeanor for the first offense
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that clear because i can i can
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
definitely see
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
under roman four anyone who sends a
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
photograph to a child
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
be considered to be on the uh
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the sex offender list but if you're
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
um someone who does it once
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
is that automatically going to put that
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
on the sex offender once
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding this is rsa 644
 
01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
my understanding this is rsa 644
449-b

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
um that that's referencing
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
the roman numeral four that says
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding paragraph two any person
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
who violates this paragraph by
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
transmitting such an image to a child
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a class b felony so
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding that would involve when
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
the recipient of the unsolicited image
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
as a child
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
they would be put in the registry i
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
if it if the recipient is an adult it
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
would necessarily invoke that
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think all right we'll talk about that
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.840 --> 01:40:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
morning uh we're now reconvening uh
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
the comedian conference on the house of
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
296 attack establishing the crime
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosure of an intimate
 
01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosure of an intimate
image

01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
image
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
it was some discussion and there was
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021-2000h
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
and is there any i would ask this be
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
some further discussion
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman thank you um as i said
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
this was another bill where we only had
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
one person testified which was
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
new representatives through bill um and
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
since that time um we've gotten um
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
some input there is a version that was
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
adopted by the senate and
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
again that's why we're here we have the
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
side side by side
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
and we've received this this morning um
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of work this is
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
a very important piece of legislation
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to be very very careful
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
we know that in today's society
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
people do this all the time and
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever reasons i i don't
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
for me i don't know maybe it's a
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
generational thing it's like
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
why would you do this but people do this
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so what we're looking at here is
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
really a division between adults and
 
01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
really a division between adults and
children

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
and we're struggling with the adult
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
behavior because someone can
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
send you a picture and it's like yeah
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
most adults will go yeah whatever and
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
throw it away and not really pay that
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
much attention to it
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
um you have people that solicit these
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
types of pictures
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
um and so we're just concerned about
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
really scooping up a whole bunch of
 
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
really scooping up a whole bunch of
people

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
especially adults that you really don't
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
want to scoop up
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
um so i'm hoping that we can agree
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
as a starting point that children
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
that this happening to kids but because
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
children cannot give their consent
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we can just kind of focus
 
01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.629 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we can just kind of focus
on

01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
kids and what happens to children
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
because i think we can
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
all agree that for a child to receive on
 
01:43:11.199 --> 01:43:11.430 align:start position:0%
all agree that for a child to receive on
a

01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
on a device whether it's an ipad or
 
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.550 align:start position:0%
on a device whether it's an ipad or
computer

01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
computer
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
or if kids are have cell phones
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
that that is unacceptable that no child
 
01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
that that is unacceptable that no child
should

01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
get these types of photos even if their
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
kids training amongst themselves
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
we know kids do this stuff that it's
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate behavior
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be addressed um
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's where we are and it's just a
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
question of finding
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
the right language that will focus on
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
minors and at at another
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
point and probably as a second part
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps legislation can get filed
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
that will deal with the issue with adult
 
01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.709 align:start position:0%
that will deal with the issue with adult
behavior

01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
um because that's what we're struggling
 
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
um because that's what we're struggling
with

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
so it may inquire of a question so we if
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
let's just say those two numerals
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
weren't there those paragraphs were
 
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.189 align:start position:0%
weren't there those paragraphs were
moved

01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
moved
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
so i think we all agree paragraph four
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
is is something that you don't like
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
what about silver
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
i read this as technically the technical
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
language that a
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
a um intimate image
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
and that's something that they could do
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
and technically the person wouldn't fall
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
under this because it was
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
solicited this has to do when it's like
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
meaning that
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
a child is on perceiving this
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
intimate image without any
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
any act of their own to action justify
 
01:44:52.639 --> 01:44:53.109 align:start position:0%
any act of their own to action justify
it

01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to be made clear that
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
the child does not have the ability to
 
01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
the child does not have the ability to
consent

01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
so even if even if you've got two kids
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
that are you know trading these they
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to you know hey i want to send you
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
a picture of this and
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
you don't children legally don't have
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to consent to either send or
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
receive those images
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
but i think consent for statutory rape
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
purposes i want to say
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
i you're correct but i'm not i'm not
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
clear that that consent would apply
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
here i think that's just because keep in
 
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.189 align:start position:0%
here i think that's just because keep in
mind

01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
that the images going back and forth
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
especially if the image is involves a
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
child who's still
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
going to be following the chakra so
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
whether this passes
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
or or not that's still going to remain
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
the law so that's still going to remain
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
a crime it's also
 
01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
a crime it's also
um

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess i'm just would we change
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
the language of power before to
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
circumstance

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
so it falls upon the other person not
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be responsible enough to know that
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
they know that they're sending
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
a child the problem that it creates a
 
01:46:14.239 --> 01:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
a child the problem that it creates a
defense

01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
defense
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
well i was sending this out i didn't
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
know what was going to a child
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
so but then again i guess you can go the
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
other way too
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
if an image is sent
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
and they missed it and a child ends up
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that miss sending it can
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
happen again
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
people were going to send intimate
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
images and they sent us
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm not sure what i don't
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
know what to say i i understand
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's it has a new not that has a number
 
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:09.910 align:start position:0%
it's it has a new not that has a number
that

01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
previously won something else right so i
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
still think you're you're
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
gonna be the act of sending it right
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna send naked pictures of
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
people well that
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
um two um
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
letter c um um so a person
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
is guilty of a misdemeanor such person
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
fornicates exposes
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
his or her genitals or reforms any sort
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
of any act of grossness under
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances which
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
he or she he or she should know
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
will likely cause a frontal alarm um a
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a class b felony if
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then c is um such person
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
purposely transmits to a child who is
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
less than 16 years
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
of age or an individual whom the actor
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes is a child less than
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
16 years of age
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
an image of himself or herself
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
fornicating exposing desert congenitals
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
or performing any other act of gross
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
moodness so the situation we're talking
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
so sending it to a child is already a
 
01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.310 align:start position:0%
so sending it to a child is already a
felony

01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure where the issues
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
amendment's supposed to be fixing the
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess what we're like i'm just
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
confused i feel like we're talking about
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
already a crime so this really is just
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
for adults
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
submit like good stuff
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
i think what this what this does though
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
if it's two adults and the sender and
 
01:48:59.590 --> 01:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
the receiver
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
the first offense will be a misdemeanor
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
if the second offense can be
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
class b the
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
but if the recipient is a child it's
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
although it's already a crime
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
what it's saying is it won't the first
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
offense there will not be a misdemeanor
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
it will be a basketball
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
and they're bypassing if that's a rate
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
of law then
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh i i suppose i we don't want to change
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
that by
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
confuse that issue by patrick castle
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
removal two or three even
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
let's just say we passed whether it's
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
the house version or
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
if we took the amendments made it in the
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the other quality i mean that reduces
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
to a violation and
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
i go back to that i don't when it comes
 
01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
i go back to that i don't when it comes
to

01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuting that if it's a violation one
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
the person's not facing any jail time
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
you take that the distance and you're
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
not going to have
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
those shouldn't and i would not in
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
effect it's a violation it's going to
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
just naturally be low priority
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
so making it a misdemeanor at least gets
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
some some teeth and it's this is
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
happening all the time part of it is
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
that well there's no there's no penalty
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
for doing it
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's why it's running rampant
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
apparently something needs to be done
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't at this amendment
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think put some protection in there and
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's already it's
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
strengthening or clarifying
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the law already and i again i if you
 
01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.149 align:start position:0%
the law already and i again i if you
send

01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
the photo accidentally the wrong person
 
01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
the photo accidentally the wrong person
i

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
sympathize with the situation but just
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
full yeah
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would hope you're very careful with
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
what you send me out there because what
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're sending out there will be
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we can look at i mean the the senate
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
version didn't deal with
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
separating out adults from children and
 
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
separating out adults from children and
you're

01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
right representative there is a whole
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
nother statute and that was
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
part of the problem because we had
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
people talking about revenge pornography
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
we already covered that
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
so if you look at what the senate did we
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
changed he or she was person
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
um but it's with the intent to harass
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they're doing it to harass you now
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
said who said by mistake sends you a
 
01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:16.870 align:start position:0%
said who said by mistake sends you a
photo

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
photo
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
and you're like wait a minute i don't
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
want to see this
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
did they do it on purpose did they do it
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
to harass you versus
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
was it a mistake and you look at the la
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
the house language
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
you have annoyed or alarmed um
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you how do you how does
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that how does that work
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we use we use the word with
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
the intention
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
it was sent deliberately to you to
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
harass you
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
in some manner and then um it says the
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
person knows the recipient has not
 
01:51:49.599 --> 01:51:50.709 align:start position:0%
person knows the recipient has not
consented

01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
consented
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask for it they they sent it
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and you did not consent to receive it
 
01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.350 align:start position:0%
um and you did not consent to receive it
and

01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
that you were harassed by you felt
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
harassed by the image
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then it says any person who violates
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the provisions of deception shall be
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
guilty of a
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
violation first offense and a
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for the second or subsequent
 
01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for the second or subsequent
event

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
if the person at the court finds a
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
person has been convicted of a violation
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
of this section
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
so that's where that's how we got to
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
i i think this is confusing people i and
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know why that's there but we you're
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
right representative we already have the
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
statute for kids so why
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
why is this even here and i think the
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
idea of putting these folks
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
on the um sex offender list
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
i mean is a very very serious something
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
because once you're on the sex offender
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
list it's virtually impossible
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
and so how do these folks get on me on
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
this list
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and what's the criteria for getting
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
them on the list
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i i would like if we're gonna look at
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
this i'd like to not deal with the sex
 
01:52:58.719 --> 01:53:00.149 align:start position:0%
this i'd like to not deal with the sex
offender

01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
offender
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
issue quite frankly because i think
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to capture people that you
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't really want to
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
the statute that's represented by
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
identified republican decency
 
01:53:18.130 --> 01:53:18.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
the concern would be is that would any
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
version that's passed whether that's the
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
house of the
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
water it down to the point that well
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
what is now roman numeral for on the
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would that not be the
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
case then
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like what we passed
 
01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.310 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like what we passed
already

01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
would actually remove children from
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
if the recipient is a child we're now
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
removing them
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
from being put into registry it's going
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
to be a violation
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
so this amendment was to address that
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
because i don't think that was what any
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
so just we in agreement on that at least
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
whether we like the whether we follow
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment or not i'm saying is
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
what we pas i'm not going to support
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
what was originally passed and i'll take
 
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
what was originally passed and i'll take
responsibility

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
i voted for a committee i don't
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
reference but it's been brought to my
 
01:54:23.199 --> 01:54:23.589 align:start position:0%
reference but it's been brought to my
attention

01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
the unattended consequence so i'm
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
thankful i have an opportunity to
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
still think this is something needs to
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
be addressed whether we address it now
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
or here i guess it's a really good
 
01:54:36.719 --> 01:54:37.189 align:start position:0%
or here i guess it's a really good
question

01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
but i i think what this does is
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
fix that i think it fixes the problem
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
because i don't think anyone wants to
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
make it so a child can receive
 
01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.229 align:start position:0%
make it so a child can receive
unsolicited

01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
unsolicited
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know image you know depicting a
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
sexual act
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the person who sends it is a bit of
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
of a fine my concern is we already have
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
that captured in statute already and i'm
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that if we pass
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
this you could get a contract
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
and this is the problem not having the
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
time to really
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
look at what's already in law and what's
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
additionally there was a harass
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
mention well
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
it could be evidence yeah i mean you can
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
make it if you do it three four times
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
over right
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty evident that's your
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
intention yeah and and that this is
 
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
intention yeah and and that this is
where

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
you don't want to capture the person who
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
oh my god
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
i accidentally you know i texted it to
 
01:55:43.599 --> 01:55:44.229 align:start position:0%
i accidentally you know i texted it to
somebody

01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
is whether it's the house version or
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment they have if that
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can advance that
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
because the problem is with that is
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
arguably the rsa here on point it will
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
conflict with that
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
in that case if you do send a child a
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
new damage
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
that it would be nothing more than a
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
violation i don't think we want that so
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
i would not support going forward at all
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i say we we work together and try to
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
resolve this yeah next year
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we tend to agree because again this
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
is an extremely
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
important issue and unfortunately on
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
our side the only testimony we had was
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
from you representative we didn't have
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
the legal community none of the
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
advocates they
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
they've all chimed in now at the very
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
with possible amendments and you know
 
01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:55.589 align:start position:0%
with possible amendments and you know
and

01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
we just need to be really careful about
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i just don't want to create a law
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
that is going to catch a lot of
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
innocent people who made just a very
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
simple mistake
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and granted look i'm not judging
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
anybody if you like to take pictures of
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
yourself that's fine
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it happens that someone
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
makes a mistake and
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
they send it to the wrong person and i
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:35.030 align:start position:0%

01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
it may be worth noting that the thing
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's currently in law
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
is both broader and narrower it's
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
narrower because it
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
defines adults 60 and under rather than
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
18 and under
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
is broader because the
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
prime is defined as um
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%

performs any other prototype of lupus
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's broader than the conduct that's
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the existing bill so it captures more
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
i will say i supported the underlying
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think we hoped i think we we all
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
support the concept of
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
what was trying to accomplish but i i'm
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
worried about the unintended consequence
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
of now
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
reducing the penalty from from the
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i take some responsibility for
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
missing that
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not perfect but it happened but if
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not comfortable comfortable uh
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding to any
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
amendment unless we adopt the one that
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
we proposed
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
just from our conversation i'm not sure
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to get there
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah do you have any thoughts
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand um
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know who's accidentally sending
 
01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know who's accidentally sending
photos

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
photos
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be a crime but i
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not always gonna get my way um
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that i don't think of all things
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i really like this amendment i think
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
it fixes
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
all the problems i think all the issues
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
we've talked about are already addressed
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
i will give you my word on this if
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment was to be filed as a i'll
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
still next year i
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
will co-sponsor with you thank you
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
will happen is uh see how it fairs in
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
one committee
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we'll try our luck
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of surprises in there but
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
we'll see but
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't have if we don't have the
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
support to put this for now
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully say we
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
advancing on what you know receding on
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to work either i would
 
02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
it's not going to work either i would
join

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
join
 
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:25.589 align:start position:0%

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%

02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%

we're not what the terminology is
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%

rockingham county district eight
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we'll just there was an
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
asked in the senate and i was allow that
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be explained
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chair oh you want me to
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
take this
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
or do you know because i'm the one who
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
so the uh the amendment was essentially
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
to attach
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
a bill of similar substance central 141
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
to away with the state police gun line
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
which has been problematic that will
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
pass the house and the senate is
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled in process
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is develop suspenders
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's essentially that's the
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed by the house
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
and senate
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
to bring this forward and state
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
suspenders for the bill that is
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled but
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
is it inviting may inquire this
 
02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.589 align:start position:0%
is it inviting may inquire this
amendment

02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
may is say word for word or at least
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
almost word for word
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
what was senator 141 it is that is
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's one point that we just found out
 
02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
there's one point that we just found out
from

02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
olier that in the final language i
 
02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:10.709 align:start position:0%
olier that in the final language i
believe

02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
effective data language there or too
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment because
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
humburger wants to put into this bill
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
abolishing the actual positions that
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
deal with the gun line
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
and that amendment is currently almost
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's imprinting literally as we speak
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to request a recess for
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
five or ten minutes until that is done
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
tracking that
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
again we just found this out about half
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
hour about an hour
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
which was filed by senator french which
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with this
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
very same issue of the underlying
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
485 and i had attached
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
a bill to this because we were concerned
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
we were going to lose the bill but
 
02:17:09.599 --> 02:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
we were going to lose the bill but
yesterday

02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference met and we
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
came to an agreement
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
so that language is no longer needed
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
either so
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
um my recommendation is this bill we
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't need this bill
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
in its entirety all right
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
any other further comments which which
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
um bill did related thing
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday and i know there was an issue
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
police in rockingham county involving
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of the recording of plans
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
that was resolved yes as well so yeah
 
02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
that was resolved yes as well so yeah
the

02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
amendment was a hybrid of both the
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
house and the senate version we worked
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
off of the house version
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
because again you had language in here
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
that we did not that we had agreed with
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it was just one other section in
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
there that we were concerned about but
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
we came from search of vehicles our
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
corrections properly yes
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
any other comments looks like that
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
we are we are not going to proceed and
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any there's
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
gonna be no concurrence so
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
no actually taken thank
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the community conference on house
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill 334
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's now
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
been there was an amending
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment pending that has now been
 
02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.670 align:start position:0%
amendment pending that has now been
prepared

02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%

02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the record mickey landrigan with the
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance office
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i can walk you through amendment
 
02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
uh so i can walk you through amendment
2014

02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
2014
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
s so there are a couple budget uh
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
technical corrections being made here
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
in align with the intent with senate
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill 141 as well as the language that
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
was inserted in house bill 334
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
so starting with section 9 this would be
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
the 100 000 appropriation to the county
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
the language that's in both senate bill
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
141 and
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
334 makes that a charge to a certain
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
class line and accounting unit in the
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety in fiscal year
 
02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:47.429 align:start position:0%
department of safety in fiscal year
2021.

02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
those funds are not available in that
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
amount to do the intent here
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
so if you look at amendment 2014 s
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
section 9 would be replaced by a
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward general fund
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation in fiscal 22 for the same
 
02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:02.870 align:start position:0%
appropriation in fiscal 22 for the same
purpose

02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
in section 10 of amendment 2 0 1 4 s
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
this would be the abolishment of three
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
positions in the permitting licensing
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
and if you look at on line 15
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 you'll see the corresponding
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation reduction for those
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
positions so there is a net here
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
of about a three hundred thousand dollar
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
budget reduction
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um in this amendment to reflect the
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the gun line abolishment
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
might have i inquire of a question so
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
this would was that 300 000
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
100 reduction in spending today here
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
correctly the 100 000 would be an
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate state spend to the counties
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then there'd be a 400
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
000 on line 17 appropriation reduction
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety for a net of
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollar spending
 
02:31:00.399 --> 02:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollar spending
reduction

02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
in in the follow-up that four hundred
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
four and one thousand six hundred fifty
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
dollars is that
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
what was that money why was that going
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
to go to fund what was
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
referred to as the gun line yeah that
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
that is included currently
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 that the countries have
 
02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:20.790 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 that the countries have
uh

02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
signed off on that report so those three
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
positions you see listed on lines 12
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
through 14
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's the funding associated with those
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
positions they are in the budget
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment here would abolish those
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
positions from the budget and take the
 
02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:33.190 align:start position:0%
positions from the budget and take the
money

02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
interesting uh saying that the fiscal
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
note on 141 was eighty seven thousand
 
02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
note on 141 was eighty seven thousand
dollars

02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
so just one year of the math camp
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
alliance for those positions
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's the jobs that are being
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated and the hundred thousand is
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
the money that's going into the account
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
the question is it just seems like a big
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
jump big difference in the numbers that
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal low was 87
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
000 and we're eliminating 200 or
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
300 000 roughly from this why
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
well there's been some changes in
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
personnel safety is hired to personnel
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
to re-staff the government okay
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
substance that will be introduced they
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
had eight troopers off the line you
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't get the details of the bill
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
because it's been passed by the house
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
and senate
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
they took eight troopers off the line to
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
staff the gun line to catch things up
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
now they're adding through personnel
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
those eight troopers go back to the line
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
those three personnel are coming out of
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
the budget it's
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
from my field trip to the uh gun line
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
three or four weeks ago
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's one trooper that's assigned
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
currently there were eight that during
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
the probe
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
they weren't out on the road i'm not
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
going to argue the mayor's new
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative because that's already
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
been voted on by both chambers
 
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
all right 400 1 000 is the amount of
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
three positions for the gun line that
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
have been eliminated by the statute by
 
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
if i can inquire so i understand that
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
that 141
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
is passed and on its way
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
that 141 was vetoed for whatever reason
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
what would then have if we eliminate
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
these positions but also
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill's veto what does that mean if you
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
read on line 18 section 11
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
oh hey that was addressed
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
in fairness this is just him no no me
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
so for some reason senate bill 141 was
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
not signed into law
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
then those positions would not be
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 141 at least sorry the
 
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 141 at least sorry the
amendment

02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
that was made to 334 otherwise someone
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
still have
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
language in there as well it's the same
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
the same as 141 this will amend
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
that language 3334 so it's consistent
 
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
i i think the purpose is if we're going
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the government
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
then this makes sense to eliminate the
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
400 000
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
that was going to allocate the funding
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
that the employees hired to
 
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know address the demand that they
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
have so that makes
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
not only makes sense whether we support
 
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
support getting rich or not i mean if
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's going it's just the right thing to
 
02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:58.469 align:start position:0%
it's going it's just the right thing to
do

02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:35:00.309 --> 02:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
mr jared i'll make a motion that we
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
adopt um
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right next question
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh that if
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 141 does
 
02:35:21.270 --> 02:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
not take effect sections 9 and 10
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill 334
 
02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
of this bill 334
would

02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
explains how that works if 141
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
and we're taught we're not talking about
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
this film we're talking about
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
example 141 which is on its own track
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
um uh becomes law sections
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
three uh three through eight of this act
 
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
shall not take effect in section seven
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 141 shall not take effect
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
if senate bill 141 does not become a
 
02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:13.429 align:start position:0%
if senate bill 141 does not become a
loss

02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
loss
 
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
section three and eight through eight of
 
02:36:17.429 --> 02:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
this act shall take effect
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
so if if for whatever reason if senator
 
02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
so if if for whatever reason if senator
won

02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
won
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoes that you have to
 
02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:24.309 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoes that you have to
leave

02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
leave
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
these other two things in place in order
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
to make a gun line work
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
so these two parts will not take effect
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
i will say if if you have the gun line
 
02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:35.990 align:start position:0%
i will say if if you have the gun line
in

02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
existence and it was unable to work
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
at all uh in and of itself would
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
essentially prevent any
 
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
legal firearm transaction involving
 
02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:49.349 align:start position:0%
legal firearm transaction involving
pistols

02:36:49.349 --> 02:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
pistols
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
um the state would have a huge amount of
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits on their hands that they would
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
like to resolve
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
because they are effectively denying
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
anyone any
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
lawful purchase of a firearm piece of
 
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:01.590 align:start position:0%
lawful purchase of a firearm piece of
pistol

02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
pistol
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
through the gun line because it's now
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
not staffed so if you're going to have
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
the gun line it must
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
at least operate in a way that it can
 
02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
at least operate in a way that it can
perform

02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
perform
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately if there's no one to
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
operate it and everything's in limbo
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
not only at the constitutional issue all
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
those scores
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
elected by business may i ask the
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
question mr london
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
if senate bill 141 does not become
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
law and
 
02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
does

02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that i understand so
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
hypothetically yeah
 
02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's the gun line if veto takes place on
 
02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:16.230 align:start position:0%
it's the gun line if veto takes place on
141

02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
141
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
unlikely but if it happened
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh then uh
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
334 would be there
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
then would these continuously still be
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
afflicted is that
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
what you're inquiring about these these
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
are going to take effect
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
if i may so i think the intent would be
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
for sections 9 and 10
 
02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
to take effect if 334 passes right
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
because you've got all the
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
language from 141 in 334 now so
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
so the abolishment of the gun line would
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
occur in 334
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
in these sections nine and ten i believe
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's the intent to have those also take
 
02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
effect the reduction in safety
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's no way for nine and ten to
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
is there any other further discussions
 
02:39:19.439 --> 02:39:21.349 align:start position:0%
is there any other further discussions
yeah

02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
i just did say i'm in opposition
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to this and uh i'm
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of 141
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
language in the 334 bill
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is one that i would
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
like to be voting for
 
02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
but i believe that the state's role
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
with the gun line and department of
 
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.790 align:start position:0%
with the gun line and department of
safety

02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
is a valuable one and
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's working well enough that
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we've heard that through testimony
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
and so i believe that
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
and support that
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
line of thought hence i i mean not
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't vote against this but i will
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
likely uh
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
with

02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
i could say on behalf of the house and i
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
was remembered to
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
say they're coming i
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
we did the house position was we ended
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
up passing
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
the bill 141 so and we also passed
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh hb 334 uh
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
so how's position would be to support
 
02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
so how's position would be to support
both

02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think this is the fiscal responsible
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
version of what
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
i would ultimately assume this should
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
have happened if you're going to
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate the downline so i don't have a
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
zero one 2021-2014 does anyone know
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
opposition

02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
i share some of the khan's position the
 
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:42.309 align:start position:0%
i share some of the khan's position the
gun

02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
gun
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
is doing a good job there has been some
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
props in the past
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
took some time went out there and did a
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
field inspection
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
everything's working well this is kind
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
of a surprise not what we were expecting
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.469 --> 02:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
it is a surprise i will say that i'm
 
02:42:04.479 --> 02:42:05.910 align:start position:0%
it is a surprise i will say that i'm
surprised

02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
but i i think i think with what it is
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
without knowing what it is is hard to
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
issue well i'll just say in respect to
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
i understand supporting and not
 
02:42:19.359 --> 02:42:20.710 align:start position:0%
i understand supporting and not
supporting

02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire downline if that's
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
abolished or not i get that
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
one senator 121 is already on its way up
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
the ladder so
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
i guess if it worked if it were going to
 
02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:31.590 align:start position:0%
i guess if it worked if it were going to
pass

02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
and let's say we couldn't get this
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
amendment what would happen
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
arguably there would be a few state
 
02:42:38.479 --> 02:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
arguably there would be a few state
employees

02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
three of them i believe with not much to
 
02:42:42.399 --> 02:42:43.349 align:start position:0%
three of them i believe with not much to
do

02:42:43.349 --> 02:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that that's is that my
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding if i'm wrong please
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
correct me that's that's my concern is
 
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
correct me that's that's my concern is
that

02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
we kind of this probably should have
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
been addressed from the start
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
whether you support the gun line or not
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think we all should agree that we
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have that 400 thousand dollars
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
on positions that don't have a unhappy
 
02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:10.710 align:start position:0%
on positions that don't have a unhappy
task

02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
task
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
right i would respect the
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
authority of the commissioner of safety
 
02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:18.230 align:start position:0%
authority of the commissioner of safety
to

02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
make appropriate staffing decisions work
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal committee
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
if there was adjustments needed to be
 
02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:29.269 align:start position:0%
if there was adjustments needed to be
made

02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
so my point is i think if you support
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment you're not necessarily
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
supporting getting rid of the
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
and you can understand why because the
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill was filed and
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
there was no budget when bill was filed
 
02:43:44.399 --> 02:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
there was no budget when bill was filed
and

02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
we were still i think when the senate
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill went through we were
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
i mean the house was still working out
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
above it so we didn't have a finalized
 
02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:52.870 align:start position:0%
above it so we didn't have a finalized
budget

02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i can i can understand why this
 
02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
so i can i can understand why this
happened

02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
and why we need to do it it's i think
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty self-explanatory we
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
just don't want to carry positions and
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
to tie
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
that being said i would agree with you
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
but we're also in a
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
higher crunch and i would expect to be
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
very easily
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
put these other people into other roles
 
02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
within the department of safety
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
rep almost immediately i would expect a
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative to say
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
that if even if we get rid of these
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
positions that
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're good employees and they are
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to find a place for them in the
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety they're not going
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
worked on the budget we know that the
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
department safety requested additional
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
positions from getting them
 
02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:57.429 align:start position:0%
positions from getting them
not

02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:57.439 --> 02:45:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
um what we need to do now is to
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overlap of what we were
 
02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
saying at least that was kind of going
 
02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
saying at least that was kind of going
on

02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
is there a second second that's been
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
the motion on the table is to accept the
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
senate version of
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes we all in agreement on that
 
02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
yes we all in agreement on that
no

02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be waiting for one and then we
 
02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:23.190 align:start position:0%
we'll be waiting for one and then we
would

02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
just make sure you say this correctly
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
you will receive to the senate amendment
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think i repeated myself thank you
