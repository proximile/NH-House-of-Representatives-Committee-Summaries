00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
connected well before so maybe he'll be
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
able to sort it out but i'll try to
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
reach out to him thank you
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
the space or something
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
mr clark
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding was if there was
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties that the meeting
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
suspended is that correct
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
members of the public notify us that
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
they can't get in we have to suspend the
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
meeting yes no i'm i'm i'm talking about
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that if there's
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties that the meeting
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
has to be suspended
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we get to him to hang
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
up his phone so somebody can call him
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we tried to reach him but the phone
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
line's busy i know because he's trying
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be on the number he might be on a
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
wrong number
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
the introductory script says in the
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
event the public is unable to access the
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
meeting the meeting will be adjourned
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
and rescheduled
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
anything about the members
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about members of
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
the committee being unable to
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
access the meeting
 
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:12.870 align:start position:0%

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i understood from our
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
discussions on friday that there was a
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that we'd be hearing an
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh from representative thomas
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
that would replace this bill with
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
something that we could all support
 
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
something that we could all support
uh

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
but what happened with that
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
we were here to discuss that with house
 
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.950 align:start position:0%
we were here to discuss that with house
leadership

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh because it would be a non-germane
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and because it is a study
 
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
amendment and because it is a study
commission

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh they advised us to do that later in
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
the session
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
we'll just retain the bill now and we'll
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
probably amend it later or possibly
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%

i guess i'll ask the question for the
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
other issue that came up when we had the
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
work session on friday which is the sort
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
of damocles hanging over the industries
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
that are worried about this bill going
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
through as it's written and
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
we had discussed or i had brought up the
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
idea of itlling it in order to remove
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
that because we won't be able to act on
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
it until the new year
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it would be um
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know from all the outrage that we
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
had from the timber industry and the
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
forestry industry and all the folks that
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
told us that they would not only lose
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
jobs but might have to close their doors
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh i know we didn't pass the bill but i
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
think just having it out there as is
 
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.110 align:start position:0%
think just having it out there as is
without

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.470 align:start position:0%
without
um

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
any relief for those folks that are
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
concerned about it is is an issue that
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
we should consider like itling it rather
 
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.190 align:start position:0%
we should consider like itling it rather
than

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
retaining it because right now it
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like we're doing it for
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
anyone in particular that it would
 
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
anyone in particular that it would
benefit

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment i will remind
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we're retaining some
 
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:43.190 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we're retaining some
bills

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
speaker reiterated that in the chairs
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
and vice versa this morning
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
so we have to basically put off
 
00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
so we have to basically put off
sadly

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
issues that are going to be
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
controversial enough to generate
 
00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
controversial enough to generate
affordability

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
and hb 213 falls into that category
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative pementel is recognized
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh not that you
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
need my vote but i would be uh
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
inclined to also vote to retain if you
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
gave us some kind of reassurance that
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh a bill that we would
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
take up in the spring
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
so we could talk about the amendment
 
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.350 align:start position:0%
so we could talk about the amendment
then

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.549 align:start position:0%
then
and

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
take that sort of damocles
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
you could give us some kind of
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
reassurance that that might be one of
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
the first bills we could
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
take up i know you said that we
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to start talking about
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.909 align:start position:0%
would be able to start talking about
retain

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
could you respond to that please thank
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes i will i
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
will reassure you that i will make every
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
effort to take this bill up in this
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
spring i can't guarantee it but i'll
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
make it for every effort to make sure
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
that that happens
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative grecian
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um just going back to
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
cat's point about taking the sort of
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
damocles over people's heads
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
i would suggest if we could unanimously
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
vote to itl today and get it on the
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
consent calendar then it wouldn't occupy
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you are correct but as i pointed out a
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
it would engender a floor debate and we
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
need to discourage floor debates
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the rest of this session
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're recognized yeah first of all it's
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
not going on consent if it was put on
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
there i'd take it off and second you
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
know you talk about industries with
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
assorted damocles hanging over their
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
heads well any industry that lives off
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
of rate pay or taxpayer subsidies is
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
always susceptible to losing that
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
subsidy they don't have a right to other
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
people's money it's a bill that was
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
passed to give it to them any bill that
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
the government passes to give somebody a
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
subsidy the government can take away and
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
they've got to realize that when they go
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
mcgee is recognized
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative harrington's perspective
 
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i've heard it before i i guess i'm
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
the people who came and spoke to us and
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
the people who submitted testimony which
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think is our job
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
we had one person in support
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we had 366 people saying this is bad
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire so i'm asking who
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to be catering to
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of other decisions that we make
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
because if they're going to up end the
 
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
economy that is supposed to be a value
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we all share that we're responsible
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
for not making those kinds of decisions
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
that will upend people's livelihoods
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
with no real justification and that's
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
how i see this bill is it's quite
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
damaging to a number of people but
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's been no there's been no
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
justification for why we're doing it
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
other than an ideological predisposition
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
that opposes renewable credits
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with you that people who
 
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.470 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with you that people who
receive

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
programs may not always want to
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
make may not uh
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
be in a position to expect that they
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
will always continue but there's also an
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
expectation by the public that the
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
government will not be capricious and
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
arbitrary in decisions that upend them
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
the other end of this which is what is
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
our reason
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
what you know there there's been no
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
justification given one person supported
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
once again i will remind you that
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
processing of the house's activity
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
is an important consideration here
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative creation you have your
 
00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:03.029 align:start position:0%
representative creation you have your
hand

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
i apologize that was from before
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative platt is recognized
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
when you're looking for a subsidy you
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
show up looking for the subject
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
the general public the general rapier
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
public doesn't necessarily show up
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they're interested in thinking
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is something i think there's
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
something in 213 the original impetus
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
was because some plants are closed
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so although they will use that so so
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's something to be salvaged in here
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
and still
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
to protect those who got on the gravy
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
further hands raised i'll ask the clerk
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the motion of retain
 
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:02.350 align:start position:0%

most customer generators

called energy so that is the order in
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
which we'll take up the remaining bills
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
so now we'll open the executive session
 
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
so now we'll open the executive session
and

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%

point out that i asked the speaker this
morning

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%

if

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
advice that we were given at the
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
advice to retain all study committee and
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
study commissions because the senate
 
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.829 align:start position:0%
study commissions because the senate
would

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
them if we pass them here
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
if that advice still stood and he said
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes that advice still stands
 
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
yes that advice still stands
so

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
i recommend that we
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
retain this bill otherwise if we pass it
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
it will get killed by the senate
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
so the chair recognizes representative
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%

00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
of retain on hb 394 is there any
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what what possible value
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
taking up the time of the committee to
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it is if if this is the uh
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
preordained conclusion is that it's
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
going to be retained
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i i i think you know in one sentence i
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
think we all understand that
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
universal access to broadband is
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
important in the 21st century as rural
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
electrification oh no no that's the
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
wrong bill this is carbon pricing
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
wrong build hp 394
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i tried to write down and
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
order the bills as you gave them to me
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.870 align:start position:0%
this bill is
wrong

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm the one who's wrong here we are on
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
hb 148.
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
394 we did 148.
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
did we do it was retained 18 2-1
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
so i was right all right and the
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
broadband bill is 153 so let's not even
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's right this one's until the end
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
394.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
394.
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
again a an extraordinarily simple bill
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission that would
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
simply prepare
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for what's coming
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
regional and national carbon pricing
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts connecticut rhode island
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
our neighbors are moving forward
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
we are part of a regional pool i think
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
it makes complete sense that we should
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is going to be
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
retained i will close my comments there
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know i i think things are changing a
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
lot quicker than
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh what was originally thought
 
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.430 align:start position:0%
uh what was originally thought
uh

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
in january when these
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
rules came up
 
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.150 align:start position:0%
rules came up
that

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
retained bills will be
 
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.309 align:start position:0%
retained bills will be
itled

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
itled
 
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
itled
i

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
i know that other um committees are
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
going ahead and
 
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.109 align:start position:0%
going ahead and
and

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.829 align:start position:0%
and
passing

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh commission
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
and committee bills
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see why we shouldn't especially
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
if we can get bills out of committee
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
on to unanimous consent i think that if
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
we could do that
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to be limp that'll take
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
care of the debates
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
during the legislation session it'll end
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
up going to committee
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh on on the other side of the wall and
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully they can uh
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
do the same thing there but i'm i think
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
we need to take a
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you bev and tell i would uh remind
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
you that uh another goal of retaining
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
bills is to avoid floor debates
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
so it's possible that a bill such as
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
this might come out of the committee
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid that and so
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is another reason for you to
 
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
that is another reason for you to
consider

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative man you're recognized
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
i agree with
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel i'm going to
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative count you're
 
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative count you're
recognized

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask what the implications
 
00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.510 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask what the implications
of

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 373 which i am
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
violently opposed
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
and this bill is our des
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
still going to be able to talk about
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
carbon initiatives and what they are
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
because somebody's got to be watching
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
the store
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
i think the federal my opinion is that
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government is going to move
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
much faster than
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
we think
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
i think they've put on the railroad
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
tracks and i i think that we need to be
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
abreast of what's going on
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
so i want to know if hindering
 
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.150 align:start position:0%
so i want to know if hindering
discussion

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the dea in des is going to stop us
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
from following these issues at all if we
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
postpone this committee which
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
i think somebody's got to stay abreast
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the issues and and
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
keep the legislation brief so that's my
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
question i'd like somebody's opinion
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
well i will give you my opinion if you
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
would like it
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that hp 373
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
was confined to a fairly narrow
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
initiatives involving
 
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.270 align:start position:0%
initiatives involving
transportation

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
whereas hb 394
 
00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
whereas hb 394
is

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
regarding a much larger issue that
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
actually is a national issue more than
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
a state issue
 
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
a state issue
so

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see the two as being
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
connected very closely together
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i see no reason why we shouldn't be
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much uh the the point
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
of this commission is to keep
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire abreast of what's
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
happening at a regional level and the
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
national level with carbon pricing and
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be prepared for that so that we can
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
be proactive in making sure that our
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
economy transitions in the way that's
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
most helpful to our residents and
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
businesses so again it's a very targeted
 
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
businesses so again it's a very targeted
issue

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
about carbon pricing but what it's about
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
is monitoring regional and national
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
trends so we're prepared
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
another thing to take into consideration
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
here is i don't know if any of you had a
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
chance to look at hb 2 yet but
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
60 pages of the
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
is involved with a description of the
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
newly proposed department
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:51.270 align:start position:0%
newly proposed department
not

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't available any
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
compelling need for us to do anything
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
with this bill right now other than
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we can probably rest assured that
 
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy will be looking
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussion uh representative
 
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
any further discussion uh representative
mann

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
mann
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes i i
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would agree with i didn't say much in
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
the previous time i agree with lee and
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh disagree about the department of
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
energy i do think the legislature and we
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
need an independent
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh study of what the national
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
very likely national level um
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing uh would um have on our
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
economy on our small businesses and so
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
on i don't we don't know
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's not an obvious thing and i think
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
we owe it to our people to study this
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
and again um
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine the senate uh voting it
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
down despite what they said because it's
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
got to be clear to them that this is an
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
important issue
thank

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%

appears that representative samson is
 
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.549 align:start position:0%
appears that representative samson is
now

00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%

we

hp 213 and we retained hb 148
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
i thought we did 106.
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion uh
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative oxen of your hand is
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
still up is uh
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
you want to say more
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much i i i'm
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
surprised by by your position that you
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
think that this is going to be handled
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
most effectively by the new department
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
of energy it seems to me your position
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the past has been that you want
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
policy made in the legislature not in
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
our agencies so i i think it's very
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
important that we should have this uh
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission available to work with the
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy going forward
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%

repetitive comments i'd like to call the
 
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
repetitive comments i'd like to call the
vote

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas has moved the
 
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.670 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas has moved the
question

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
see no further hands raised i asked the
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the motion
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
so the question has been called
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
oh yes uh jd bernard
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay we've been in the voting mode
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
all right so the clerk please call the
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
what is your question if the motions
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be removed and the motions could
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
then be remade so that representative
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
but he was here when the question was
 
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
but he was here when the question was
called

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
so he can vote
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%

speaking
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
sorry uh i i'm not sure about that since
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
i might i brought up my
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
my video later after i got on so i'm not
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
certain about it
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it if we can clarify
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm a voting member or not at this
 
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.870 align:start position:0%
if i'm a voting member or not at this
point

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.589 align:start position:0%
point
i

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
will clarify it because we faced this
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
identical issue earlier in the session
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i had a discussion with the clerk
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
you may recall that
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative notter was out of the
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
room when we opened an exec session on
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
an earlier bill i don't remember exactly
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
what bill it was
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
but then she came back into the room and
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
we suspended the exact session because
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't think she'd be able to vote so
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
i went and talked to the clerk about it
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
and he says as long as you're in the
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
room and present when the question is
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
called when the clerk calls the question
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
if you are in the room
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
and present at that time then you can
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
work that is correct you missed the
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
exact session discussion you can still
 
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.829 align:start position:0%
exact session discussion you can still
vote

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct but the question was
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
called wasn't it that's what we were
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
discussing the question and it had been
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
called am i correct mr claire
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
no you are not correct
 
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
no you are not correct
fine

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
then somebody's got to make a motion
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
thomas to retain
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 394.
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm not calling the clerk to call the
 
00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
so i'm not calling the clerk to call the
roll

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
roll
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
it was already seconded jackie by by
 
00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:55.349 align:start position:0%
it was already seconded jackie by by
janine

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
janine
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
i know that the emotion was made and
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
once a motion is made if you're out of
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
the room the same thing happened to
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative harrington okay he was
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
out of the room he wasn't present the
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
motion was made and once the motion is
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
made you're in the voting mode that's
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
all that's the parliamentary procedure
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
whether the executive session is called
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
or not that has nothing to do with it
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's whether the when the vote was made
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
the motion was made the motion was on
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
that's all and
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i just uh suggest
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
instead of wasting time about discussing
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
this could we just kind of
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
rewind this a little bit and start over
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
again it probably saves more time than
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you're probably right okay so
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative thomas will you re
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion to retain hp394
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes i will just throw my motion to
 
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.109 align:start position:0%
yes i will just throw my motion to
retain

00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'll tell a second
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved in seconded that we
 
00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved in seconded that we
that

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative thomas withdraws his
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
motion for retain on hb 394 i don't
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
think it requires a second
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
now i will recognize representative
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
thomas motion to repay
 
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.309 align:start position:0%

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
retain hb 394. we've already had a
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's now official that representative
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
samsic can vote so i'll ask the clerk to
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%

passes
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it demonstrates uh why we need to
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
retain these
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have a broad agreement on that

consideration of the members who
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
seem to feel that this is an issue of
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
belief rather than of scientifically
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we will not
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
simply put it on the shelf and retain it
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i personally don't think religion
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
belongs in this but being a religion a
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
theology major i don't think there's any
 
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
theology major i don't think there's any
religion

00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
religion
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
or any kind of group
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the world that does not
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
advocate stewardship
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
and taking care of the environment and
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
that goes back 10 000 years because
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think that that's universal whether
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis or not that's debatable
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
but taking care of our environment and
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing that we keep it
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
as pristine and as as clean as we can
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think is debatable across any
 
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
i don't think is debatable across any

thank you mr chairman um
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
i would just like to suggest that if
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
there is any religion in this committee
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
it should be the religion of science so
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what religious faith
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
you may belong to
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think we need to put science in the
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
foreground of our deliberations here
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is the duty we have we are the only
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
institution in the state
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
that specifically deals very deeply with
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
and we'd be well informed and we should
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
be willing to listen and we should be
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
willing to articulate what we think is
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
the best for our our state and our
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
citizens thank you
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
um

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to think that we could
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
achieve great things without goals but
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
i seriously doubt that can happen
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
 
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.109 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
which

01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
establishes goals or works towards
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
establishing goals
 
01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.750 align:start position:0%
establishing goals
and

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
i i think that this is a bill we should
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
not be retaining we should be otping
 
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
not be retaining we should be otping
this

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh make the goals so we can reach the
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative thomas is
 
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.309 align:start position:0%

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
state that
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative kelly fitz's
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
comments as they were stated and i don't
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe anyone here
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
we advocate being poor stewards of our
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
environment in any way i think the issue
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
is one of methodology
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's complex
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's why we need to
 
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.589 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's why we need to
retain

01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
these types of bills for
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
a lot more discussion because it's not a
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm reacting to the all of the other
 
01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:26.550 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:28.390 align:start position:0%

we can't just sit here and do nothing
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
and in addition to everything else and
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
all the other good reasons for doing
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
this climate action plan and really
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
taking this issue seriously
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of jobs
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
at stake
 
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.309 align:start position:0%
at stake
the

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
lower class the working class people
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
take a shower after they go to work
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
instead of before
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
you know are losing jobs left and right
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and working on
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
climate mitigation
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
transportation issues buildings issues
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
could provide a lot of jobs and i i
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
any downside to having a climate action
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
plan that that it's intelligent and i
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good thing for all of
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
us thank you and and by the way
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
i have grandchildren that have to live
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the future and i take this personally
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
i really think we
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
i need to say that
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
i said don't forget to unmute you are
 
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.950 align:start position:0%
i said don't forget to unmute you are
recognized

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it as a co-sponsor on this
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill um i just thought i should
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh mention the fact that
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think one of the reasons that the
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
bill came forward is that we have spent
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
the last several years
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
in a place where we haven't moved
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of goals
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i do understand that in sb2 there's
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
additional definition coming as to what
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
a department of energy would be once one
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
is reinstated
 
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.349 align:start position:0%
is reinstated
[Music]

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
but i think that the legislature has a
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
separate obligation as was mentioned
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
already which is why i was in favor of
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing this bill there is a lot of good
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
information we could pull together
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly just to
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
be able to have goals
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then everything else would come from
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
that and it just makes perfect sense for
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
us to do that which is why i i am very
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
sorry to see delay delay delay on things
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
that really are just essential
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
good policy for any state to have so
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to throw my two cents in
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
because i i really did think that this
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
was something that's time had come and i
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
didn't think that we would have a
 
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.069 align:start position:0%
didn't think that we would have a
partisan

01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know that there would be partisan
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
perspective on it if you're actually
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
looking at what's going on in the larger
 
01:04:57.039 --> 01:04:59.589 align:start position:0%
looking at what's going on in the larger
world

01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my remarks
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that uh the
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative weston had
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh attempted to bring forward an
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that would have changed
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
des to the department of energy but
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
because the department of energy does
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
not yet exist ols was unwilling to
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment that would have
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
changed that
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
should the bill go forward i believe
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
that the senate would be um

thank you mr chair um although we
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
motioned a motion to retain this i think
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill and we
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
learned this morning uh and our
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
earlier meeting that uh
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
we might be able to put together an a in
 
01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
we might be able to put together an a in
committee

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to discuss how we might
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
want to present this bill when we take
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
it up again later on this spring or
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
offer that that might be something we
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
may want to consider
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that was breaking up and i i
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
the representative's remarks
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas could you uh
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
move a little closer to the mic over
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
there and try to repeat what you're
 
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
there and try to repeat what you're
writing

01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
what i said was i'm very interested in
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh i think it it needs a little bit of
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
work and i but we did learn this morning
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
that if it's something that we could do
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
in house
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
meaning within this committee only uh it
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
may be possible to have our own sub
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
committee to work on something that we
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
can bring forward when we take up this
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill again later on the spring or
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
possibly in the fall so i would i would
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative sausage is recognized
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i i also
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
agree with representative thomas this is
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
a really important bill
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
and if um
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
if we are assuming that by retaining it
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to work on it
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and get something done
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
i would be very much in favor of that
 
01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
i would be very much in favor of that
too

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the issue of a
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee seems to me to be different
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
from retaining but i'm not really clear
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the boundary line could could you
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
give us some clarification uh mr chair
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
as to how this a subcommittee
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
could work with how we would have to
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
vote in order to proceed with the
 
01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
vote in order to proceed with the
subcommittee

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
well a subcommittee is something that we
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
could establish if we retain the bill
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
another option is we could establish a
 
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.470 align:start position:0%
another option is we could establish a
subcommittee

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
before

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
without retaining the bill
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
however if we did the latter it would
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
require that we
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
complete work on the bill
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
work

01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
in time for it to come up before the
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
regular house
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
which will be sometime in early april
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's time to do any
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
significant work between now and then so
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
i suspect the best we can do here is to
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
and work on it later
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you uh just to add uh to
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
that question um also we learned this
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
morning that if we do something in-house
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
within this committee as as
 
01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
within this committee as as
subcommittee

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest difference is that
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
we we would not have any senate
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
representation on any subcommittee but
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
we could still work on it amongst
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves here throughout the remaining
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
period and come up with uh perhaps
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
something uh that we would might be able
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
to work on when we take this up against
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that's the biggest that's the
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxenam do you need a
 
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxenam do you need a
follow-up

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
trying to process our
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
our upcoming schedule it seems that
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to have about about a month
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
of hiatus between today
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the three days of marathon on i
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
believe it's april 7 8 9 there's
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
something in that area
 
01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:10.950 align:start position:0%
something in that area
um

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
i agree i wouldn't want to to set up a
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
situation where we had to complete our
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
work by that time but if we could
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
again ask the chair for an assurance
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that he would do everything in his power
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
to make it possible for us to advance
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
with this and use this month that we
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
have available to us to actually begin
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
work on something that is of such
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
importance to our constituents
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could come to an agreement on
 
01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could come to an agreement on
this

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
well i'm just looking at the
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
first page of the house calendar
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
of friday march 5th
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
which was um
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
last friday and the first page says that
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
pursuant to house rule 67
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
after discussing the proposal with the
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
majority and the minority leaders
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
the speaker has decided to alter the
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled deadlines
 
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
scheduled deadlines
and

01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:08.070 align:start position:0%
and
he

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
changed the last day to report all house
 
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
changed the last day to report all house
bills

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
to april 1st of 2021
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
today is may uh march 8th
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
and april 1st
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
i believe is about
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
21 days from now
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that would give us
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
a new
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
universal internet access for the state
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's establishing a committee to discuss
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
it but what i was asking was if we could
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
use this time to begin that work to
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a reasonable request however
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
i can't guarantee that we can do that
 
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
i can't guarantee that we can do that
because

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
we were also told at an earlier meeting
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
today that senate bills will start
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
coming to us very soon
 
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.950 align:start position:0%
coming to us very soon
and

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
even though we're not at official
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
crossover yet we've been advised that we
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
should start deliberating on these
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
senate bills
 
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
senate bills
so

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.709 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
it'll all depend once again on room
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
schedules and
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
the available availability of zoom
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
licenses the the house only has five
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
zoom licenses so that limits the num the
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
number of meetings we can have on any
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
given day
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i can't
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
promise that we would do something on hb
 
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.189 align:start position:0%
promise that we would do something on hb
153

01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
153
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
we'll try to squeeze something in but if
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
senate bills take precedence and we
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
might not
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
might not be able to do anything but if
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
we retain the bill we'll certainly be
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
able to do something later
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
you have a comment
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
not anymore okay representative mick
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair bose um i just
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
i want to note something for the record
 
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.669 align:start position:0%
i want to note something for the record
um

01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm frustrated hearing that
 
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
i'm frustrated hearing that
house

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:21.750 align:start position:0%
house
leadership

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
is claiming the senate will not pass any
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
study committees or commissions um
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
i've been checking in on senate bills
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i just want to note for the record
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
that uh senate bill 71
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
as amended establishing a commission to
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
develop science-based emissions
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
reduction goals for the state of new
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire so the senate is passing
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
so i really take
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns about claiming that
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
the senate won't pass those and i want
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
i can only tell you what i've been told
 
01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.310 align:start position:0%
i can only tell you what i've been told
by

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion on this
 
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion on this
question

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain house bill 153.

yes thank thank you mr chair
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that we have
 
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
three count them three amendments to
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
this bill which means there's a lot of
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
interest in trying to get it done right
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
interest in trying to get it done right
um

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
are we sure that we're retaining it
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
without discussing or accepting any of
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
these amendments is the way we want to
 
01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
these amendments is the way we want to
go

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
the retained motion has to be uh
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
judged first we can entertain additional
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
emotions if retained
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative kim grills is recognized
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
i have a similar question if we could if
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to retain it without
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
having to look at the amendments or pass
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
the anonymous post
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
yes it is correct that we can retain the
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill without entertaining
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendments which might be
 
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.390 align:start position:0%
amendments which might be
apropos

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
and then is it true that if the retain
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
motion fails we would be able to
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
consider the amendments
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
for a new motion okay thank you
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
see none i'll ask the clerk
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%

01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i want to know what the
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
rationale is
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
we understand that there are
 
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.430 align:start position:0%
we understand that there are
are

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that are ready
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do some of this
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that when we
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
postpone this or retain it
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
we are putting off their planning
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
in this reopen new hampshire atmosphere
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.669 align:start position:0%
right now
and

01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's a wise i think
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
the governor at this point is saying
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
be open get industry going get
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
everything going again and we are
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
honking that
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
by putting off some of these bills
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
the earliest we can bring these retained
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
bills back
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong is next year
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so we have put things off a whole
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
year for people who can't afford to have
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
things put off a year
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
i think that we could reach a compromise
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere if we worked at it i don't
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
think that there's a push to retain it
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
today we have until april 1st to see if
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
we can come to a compromise on this
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we ought to just put on the
 
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
i think that we ought to just put on the
brakes

01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
brakes
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
and say let's see if we can work
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
something out we know there are projects
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
ready to go projects mean jobs jobs mean
 
01:23:12.719 --> 01:23:13.669 align:start position:0%
ready to go projects mean jobs jobs mean
money

01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
money means
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
people are are backed into purchasing
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
and they're off the unemployment rolls
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that's that's all the goals
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
besides efficient power and sustainable
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
power so i think we ought to see
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
in all
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
honesty if we can work this out within
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
the next few weeks by honest discussion
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
we've seen what discussion can do and
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
how it can bring us together
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
on things we never thought we could come
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
together on
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've given it a fair shot
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
at honest
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
downright discussion and i i think we
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
could do that i think this committee is
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
more than capable of reaching a
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
compromise so i i really do believe that
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that retaining and putting
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
things off for a year
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
and probably more than a year
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
in this especially in this atmosphere
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
where things have been put off for a
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
year already
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
we are doing a disservice
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
all the citizens of new hampshire and to
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
pers and to our governor and
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
who wants to get things going again
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would remind uh
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
everyone here that we have two goals
 
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.070 align:start position:0%
everyone here that we have two goals
here

01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
one is to decide what to do with these
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
bills and admittedly
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
some of them have promise and
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
future deliberations of this committee
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
made churn out a bill that's acceptable
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
to everyone that is definitely a
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
possibility and retaining doesn't
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
preclude that possibility
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
but there is another goal here and that
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
goal is to
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
allow the orderly process of house
 
01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.830 align:start position:0%
allow the orderly process of house
business

01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
under very difficult circumstances
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
and those circumstances are that we're
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
only going to be able to meet
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
two or three more times in full house
 
01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.550 align:start position:0%
two or three more times in full house
sessions

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
before the april 8th crossover bid
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna have to process a huge
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
number of bills during those two or
 
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.350 align:start position:0%
number of bills during those two or
three

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
house sessions
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i didn't
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
particularly enjoy
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
the session we had last year where
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
we were working on bills at 3 30 in the
 
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
we were working on bills at 3 30 in the
morning

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to have to do that
 
01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to have to do that
again

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the only way we can prevent that
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
is to avoid
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
floor debates
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
avoid bringing forward bills that will
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
generate floor debates
 
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.070 align:start position:0%
generate floor debates
and

01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
i know for a fact in talking to members
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
of my caucus
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
that if we bring forward hb 106
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
as is or in a modified version
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
it will likely generate florida
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
whether we
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
pass it or whether we kill it
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so in order to avoid that outcome
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
i personally think the smartest thing we
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
can do is retain house bill 106
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
and then try to come up with a
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
compromise that we can all live with
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
at a future day
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative pimentel is recognized
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
11 30.
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
have a discussion
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
on some of these amendments
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get to
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
a compromise bill that
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
would go to the legislature
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
so why don't we give it a try why
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
why uh retain it
 
01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.790 align:start position:0%
why uh retain it
and

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh just push this out into the future
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh while people are waiting for this
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh they want us to
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's within this
 
01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.430 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's within this
committee

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
some reasonable compromises that maybe
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
we could just be able to move forward on
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is uh recognized
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
i definitely appreciate what you said
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
about the house sessions and how we're
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
trying to limit
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
limit the um you know the floor fights
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
and and the amount of time that we need
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
to be together for voting i think that's
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
a that's a realistic um
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know goal for for leadership to try
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to limit those floor
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
debates but we are going to have floor
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
debates so i think from our committee we
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
should we should have been determining
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
all along what are the most important
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
priorities that we're trying to get over
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
the finish line
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
and for the folks who are new on both
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle i just wanted to
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
01:28:07.679 --> 01:28:08.709 align:start position:0%
mention that
um

01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
this bill you know the idea of raising
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
the net metering cap is not new right it
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back um usually up to five
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
and we had passed it with a veto proof
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
majority and then it was vetoed and then
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
the second vote on overturning the veto
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
what you know there was a whole bunch of
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
wrangling going on all through the
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
summer and everything and you know when
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
it came back for a vote um it wasn't
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
overridden but the fact is it's about it
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
has bipartisan support because so many
 
01:28:36.719 --> 01:28:38.149 align:start position:0%
has bipartisan support because so many
representatives

01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
are working in towns where they are
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
being told by their leadership we need
 
01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.270 align:start position:0%
being told by their leadership we need
this

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't think this is one that we
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
should gloss over because we're worried
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
about the extra amount of time it might
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
take for us to have people discuss their
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the floor that's always a
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
problem and we can have that on lesser
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
bills but this is not a lesser bill in
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
people around the state um asking for it
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
and expecting us to do something on it
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just asking everybody to
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not a it's not a
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
partisan issue there are people who have
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
partisan perspectives on it but in terms
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
of representing constituents
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's cross-section it's a it's
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan effort of people who are
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get this over the finish line
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i do think we should spend more time
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
on it than to just
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
push to retain
 
01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
push to retain
so

01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah just so people are clear and we
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't waste time on it this bill will
 
01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:35.150 align:start position:0%
not go on consent
 
01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.350 align:start position:0%
not go on consent
[Music]

01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:38.190 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
although i agree with the sentiment uh
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
being centered about this bill uh
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
i am hearing the same sentiment for the
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
third time i want to call the question
 
01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.629 align:start position:0%
third time i want to call the question
please

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
thomas calls the question
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
in case we need to excuse me mr chairman
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
just because a member thinks they hear
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
the same argument there's no no reason
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
to cut off debate i could have could
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
update long ago when i heard some
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made twice
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a reason to cut off
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
any debate just because somebody says
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
i've heard this before i've heard a lot
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
of things from the other side before and
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
i don't call them all the time because i
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
let them speak i think you should give
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
us the same courtesy mr chairman
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sanchez even
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
though i didn't call on you to speak
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has made a motion
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
and it is a legal and legitimate motion
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
so we have to
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative platt has seconded the
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
motion that we call the question
 
01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
motion that we call the question
representative

01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
you have a parliament i have a question
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
my hand is up
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
is it a debatable motion
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
moving the question no i don't believe
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
is it i i know that
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
and so if it's not debatable
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
then we're in a real
 
01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.709 align:start position:0%
then we're in a real
hole

01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
hole
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
and if it is debatable
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
then we need to be able to debate it so
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
i need to know definitively is it a
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
debatable motion i'm not sure
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
well we can call the clerk but i'm not
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to the table
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh representing honor is trying to get
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
any of anything
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think i have a point of order mr chair
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine what's your
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
point of order i was the only person
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
with a hand up at the time that the
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
cutting off of debate occurred and i
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
think i could make my point in less time
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
than it will take for us to hear from
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
well while we're waiting to get
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
an answer from the clerk i'll allow you
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
to speak go ahead
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir i i i'm
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to the point that was raised by
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee uh for the first
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
time which was about the fact that we're
 
01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
time which was about the fact that we're
prioritizing

01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
prioritizing
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
the efficiency i should i i guess i
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
should say of of debate on the session
 
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
should say of of debate on the session
four

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
this is our job this is why we were sent
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
here if it takes us an extra day if it
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
takes us all night we're supposed to
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
debate we're supposed to be thorough and
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think that this whole notion of
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
cutting things off so it can be rammed
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
through and no debates does a disservice
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
to our constituents and to us as
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
legislators thank you
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas is
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
recognized no not i didn't lower my hand
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
sorry oh i'm sorry
 
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.709 align:start position:0%
sorry oh i'm sorry
recogni

01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
recogni
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative sausage is recognized
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i really think
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
that they're uh
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
in con i don't i hate to contradict uh
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative harrington because he's
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
usually right
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
but i think there's a possibility to
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
have this on consent
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
if we find some common ground here as
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh kelly pitts mentioned
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's possible to do that and
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
incidentally if we can find some common
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
ground on this i am assured that uh on
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
the floor we won't have that much debate
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
on it because we'll have a very strong
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of something
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned this is about
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and towns who are ready
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
to do something take action
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
all they are is waiting for some
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines this is a republican bill
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're willing to support it we're
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
willing to compromise on it and just as
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
a point of information
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
about the hydro facilities in nashua
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
they have two facilities one has a one
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
megawatt capability the other one has a
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
three megawatt capability maybe we can
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
find some way of finding middle ground
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
here so i would encourage us to consider
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
those amendments and see if we can't
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
at the clerk
 
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.709 align:start position:0%
at the clerk
and

01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
it appears that a motion to call the
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
question is not allowed in a committee
 
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.709 align:start position:0%
question is not allowed in a committee
session

01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
so we can continue to discuss this issue
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
and then we will vote once we have
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
exhausted our ability to discuss it
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
so is there any further question or any
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
further debate rather on the question of
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
see okay representative pimentel you're
 
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.709 align:start position:0%
see okay representative pimentel you're
recognized

01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:19.510 align:start position:0%
recognized
uh

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i would hope that maybe this motion
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
to retain could be
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
an octopass
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it further
 
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.229 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it further
and

01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
octopass doesn't come
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
it fails then we can uh look at some of
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
recognized my my question would be if
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
if this is our
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it's pertinent
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
our last session
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
among ourselves
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
it would seem that we have
 
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
it would seem that we have
time

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.270 align:start position:0%
time
or

01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
left because we have dates that we can
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can still meet
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
when it would it be impossible to get
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
and the stakeholders again as we have
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
done before it's tedious it's long it's
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
but we can do it
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we can do it in a timely manner if
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
anything was controversial it was 3 15.
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
and look what happened look what we did
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
and i think we can we can at least give
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
it an effort
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
to do it again without holding this up
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
again for a year and possibly 18 months
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what's going to happen with
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
colbit over the summer we don't they can
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
talk all they want but they've been
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
wrong before
 
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
wrong before
so

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
that effort might be worth it even if
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's a one-shot deal
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh rather than just saying okay we're
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
gonna put this off for a year and a half
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what happens i
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
i really believe that and i think
 
01:37:11.199 --> 01:37:13.109 align:start position:0%
i really believe that and i think
retaining

01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
is the wrong thing and i have more faith
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
then i think a lot of people have
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
because i know we've come up with very
 
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.070 align:start position:0%
because i know we've come up with very
complicated

01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
decisions before on much more
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
complicated issues
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
was it easy now did we all like
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
everything no but we came with a
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
compromise and i think the sponsor ought
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
involved in this with all of us
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
not just with
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
10 of us
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
with all of us
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can talk this over
 
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.590 align:start position:0%
so that we can talk this over
realistically

01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
and get it through you can still retain
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
it in in two weeks you could still
 
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.709 align:start position:0%
it in in two weeks you could still
retain

01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh will it end debate on the flawed no
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
because something else is going to be
 
01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
because something else is going to be

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
when i left the uh session last week i
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
was so upset that i drove through lowell
 
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.590 align:start position:0%
was so upset that i drove through lowell
massachusetts

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
because

01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
we debated something that to me was
 
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.310 align:start position:0%
we debated something that to me was
ridiculous

01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
printing amendments
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
let's debate something that's
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful and mean something to people
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
with all the facts on the table
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think pushing this off is gonna
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
work or i think i don't think it's gonna
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
be any better
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the next year if we can't do it now
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to do it next year
 
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.350 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to do it next year
either

01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes my case and
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
plea for uh compromise i i really
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
i wonder if
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
members of this committee
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
would change their mind about this
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
retained motion
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
if they learned that there are members
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
of this committee who refuse
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
who will refuse to accept an expansion
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
of net metering
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
no matter what it looks like
 
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.910 align:start position:0%
no matter what it looks like
that

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
they believe that net metering is
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
not good public policy
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
therefore they won't move forward
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you knew that
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
would it change your mind about
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill in order to avoid
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
what would turn out to be a floor fight
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
over this bill
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's a question i put to the committee
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to answer that
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
in danger of repeating myself i i think
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's no reason we should be afraid of
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
a floor fight
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that that's not how the legislature
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
works that's not our responsibility our
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to put forward the
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
best possible policy and i'm sorry that
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
there are individuals on this committee
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
who have the wrong-headed notion that
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
net metering is somehow not good public
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
policy it's been used uh throughout the
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
country for over decades has made for a
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
substantial expansion of renewable
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
energy and moving us forward into the
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
clean carbon
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxygen i'm going to
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
have to take a sec some sick
 
01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
have to take a sec some sick
exception

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get out
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
to your characterization that uh
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
someone's opinion about
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
net metering is wrong-headed
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
i urge you to choose different language
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness that was so so soft i i
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
can't imagine anyone
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
um i i will leave the adjective aside
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
some people are opposed to net metering
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
i as a as a policy
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know i believe i might have been
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
muted after i said that my point was
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
that net metering has been used
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
successfully across the country for
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
decades as a way of advancing us towards
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
the clean energy future we all i hope
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
really don't we all recognize as des
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
told us on friday this is coming
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
electrification is coming we are
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
removing fossil fuels for our health
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
because it's it's resulting in premature
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
deaths because it's not it endangers a
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
stable climate on the planet
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
we need to be moving forward and not
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
stuck in old ideological ruts
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
i i ask you
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have manchester with plans to go
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
forward lebanon with plans to go forward
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
concord basketball and across the state
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
these are jobs this is positive action
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
for our constituents please let us go
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative all of those projects
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned can move forward
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
without net metering representative
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
murder is recognized yes um we have this
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
one grande bill last year that almost
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
passed um but we had
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
almost an identical bill to this bill
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the representatives who were there
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
motioned to table this bill they killed
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
it we had a compromise with the governor
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
and with we didn't have everybody on
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
board with in our caucus we surely don't
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
we still don't have everybody but we had
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
a good bill and the motion was made by
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
table by
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
then and it's funny that former uh
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
leader that called me a couple weeks ago
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
to talk to me
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
and he said one of the biggest mistakes
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
we made with net metering last year was
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
was tabling with the republican bill
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
last year and he admitted that was his
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
biggest mistake in the committee last
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
year so we've already kicked the can
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
down the road a year let's get it right
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh obviously
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions uh i did
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
last year and it was tabled so
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
in committee so
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh you can plan on that all we want all
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
of a sudden there's a big urgency now
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
they they're the ones that tabled this
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill last year and i'll just leave it at
 
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.709 align:start position:0%
bill last year and i'll just leave it at
that

01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think we could we could pass a bill
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
out of this committee whether it's the
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
one that we're dealing with or an
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
amendment i think we could pass a bill
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
out of committee
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i think we should
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
give that a chance
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh vote no on retaining and
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative mann you're recognized
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i'm i'm old

and i'm lazy but i'm looking forward to
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work on this bill because
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's something that'll be very
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
exciting to get done
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we'd be proud of ourselves
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%

um maybe i can pick up some of what
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
rebecca's trying to say um i mentioned
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
when i spoke before that there are three
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
pending amendments that have been put in
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the history from um in
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
there was a bill 1218 that was for
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
raising the full net metering cap and it
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
was basically similar language to hb 167
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
which we retained earlier today so that
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
was the whole enchilada right that was
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
up to five megawatts
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
and yes the folks that were in
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
leadership us you know committees last
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
time that's what we wanted so that was
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
the reason that representatives lange's
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill in the last session didn't make it
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
through is because if that was passed
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
then there would be very there would be
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
no chance that the larger bill would
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
so this time we have an amendment for
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
two megawatts an amendment for three
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
megawatts and an amendment for five
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.149 align:start position:0%
megawatts and an amendment for five
megawatts

01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i think what we need to do
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think what everybody is asking for
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's been speaking and which i agree
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
with is that we have to have the debate
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves around
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
what should we do
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
because there may be people who always
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
think we shouldn't do anything and
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that's not all of us and
 
01:46:00.159 --> 01:46:00.870 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that's not all of us and
so

01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
this idea of compromise that uh
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts brought up
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'm in full agreement with because we
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
keep going around and around knowing we
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to do something the question is
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so we probably need further
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
conversation to figure out which one of
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the three amendments is the right
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment for now
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
but once we have some consensus around
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
which one we would be willing to put
 
01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
which one we would be willing to put
forward

01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think we would do a floor fight and
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
let you know let the full house decide
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it is an issue that's been pending a
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
long time i think for our committee to
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
not come out with anything with all of
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
the history that's gone before i mean
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative lang and i we both we
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored that bill 106 because
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know we want something done and um
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
so i i really hope that we don't
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
abdicate the responsibility that we have
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
by pushing it to retain because that
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
just does nothing and people have been
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
that we could have a debate about the
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
three amendments
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that would change our
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
position on retain because we can have
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
that debate
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
and if we retain the bill we avoid
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
adding to the
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
length of a house session that we'll be
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
having later this session
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
later this
 
01:47:28.639 --> 01:47:31.350 align:start position:0%
later this
month

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
or early next month
 
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
or early next month
so

01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to propose a compromise right
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
here i'm going to propose that we take a
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
lunch break from 12 to 1
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.159 --> 01:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
debate the three amendments
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
however before we do that i would like
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
to vote on the motion to retain
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh 106.
 
01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.270 align:start position:0%
uh 106.
so

01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
that would be my compromise for now uh
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative nick williams can you
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
speak now can you
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay great um thank you very much chair
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
bose um my recommendation is if we could
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
get in touch with um
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives i
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
think it would be really helpful to have
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
someone um just weigh in on the
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
governor's stance on 106.
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
which i think would be a good faith
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
effort to coming up with a compromise
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
i would request that we do that for
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
before we take a vote on retain so my
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
take back the retain motion and not vote
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
on that and instead um just treat it
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
like a work session right after lunch
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
and get some feedback i think that would
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
be probably the fair way to move forward
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mick williams
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
glad you figured out how to get back on
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay so seeing no further discussion i'm
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to call the role
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%

vote of 11 to 10 hb 106 is retained
 
01:50:27.679 --> 01:50:28.709 align:start position:0%
vote of 11 to 10 hb 106 is retained

and
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can start a discussion of the three
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendments proposed for it
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
at one of
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
lunch so i look forward to seeing you
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
all again can i ask i'm confused if it's
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
being retained why are we discussing
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendments that's not moving anywhere
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative creation you were not
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
recognized representative callie fitz
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
again i i don't understand what the um
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
what we would go over the amendments for
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
because there's no point in doing it now
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
because we can't unretain it
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
but the bill is still in committee so i
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can change the vote
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
01:51:05.199 --> 01:51:06.790 align:start position:0%
there's another
parliamentary

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
question because it hasn't gone to the
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
clerk yet so if discussing these
 
01:51:11.199 --> 01:51:12.870 align:start position:0%
clerk yet so if discussing these
amendments

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.470 align:start position:0%
amendments
um

01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
is valid so that if there's a
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
possibility of pulling
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the bill back and changing the vote
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable but if once we
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
retain it and
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
because it's still in the house can we
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
do some still in committee can we do
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
something it has not been released from
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
committee yet
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to ask
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative vos
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
was i correct in that we are doing
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
nothing for the next three weeks is that
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
in our committee not
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
but in the committee are we doing
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
nothing for the next three weeks
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh not really
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
we were told this morning that senate
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
bills will start coming our way
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
so we probably will have other sessions
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
before the end of march to deal with
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
senate bills
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know how many there will be i
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how old they will be
 
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
don't know how old they will be
but

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
you have to keep in mind and i realized
 
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
you have to keep in mind and i realized
that

01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
that
because

01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm the chair of the committee and and
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
doug thomas is vice chair we are
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with this every day and you guys
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
and i i understand that
 
01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:25.750 align:start position:0%
and i i understand that
but

01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with room availability
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with the fact that the
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
house only owns five zoom licenses
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so there's a limit to the number of
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
meetings that we can have on a given day
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
so there are scheduling constraints that
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
that make it difficult for us to just
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
say okay let's get together and have a
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
chat you know let's let's get together
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
as a committee and and have a work
 
01:52:50.719 --> 01:52:52.709 align:start position:0%
as a committee and and have a work
session

01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
if i can follow up i thought we had
 
01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
if i can follow up i thought we had
mondays

01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
mondays
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
and fridays which i don't like because i
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't like short weekends but i thought
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
that those were our assigned days and
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
utilize them
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh how
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
however the chairman saw fit fit
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
that may not be solved
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is not so monday is
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
our assigned date
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
and fridays are occasionally available
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
if another committee doesn't need
 
01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.830 align:start position:0%
if another committee doesn't need
uh

01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
that is assigned to friday doesn't need
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
that day
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
so we have been allowed to do some
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
fridays but it doesn't mean that all
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
fridays are available
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
can we find out somehow if this bill can
 
01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.149 align:start position:0%
can we find out somehow if this bill can
be

01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
somehow what you said about it's not
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to be changed and nobody's mine is
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
going to be changed and it won't change
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
this year and probably won't change next
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
year because we'll all be the same
 
01:53:46.639 --> 01:53:47.669 align:start position:0%
year because we'll all be the same
people

01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:53:47.679 --> 01:53:49.669 align:start position:0%
people
but

01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
if something could still be done to this
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill since it has not left the committee
 
01:53:55.199 --> 01:53:57.510 align:start position:0%
bill since it has not left the committee
yet

01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
so could we change the retain
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes something could still be done with
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
this bill
uh

01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
vote to reconsider the retain motion and
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
overturn the retainment
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
and we can do that we could do something
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
with this bill before
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
april 1st which is our deadline
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
a motion to
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
reconsider the retaining motion would be
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
successful but we could try
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you what i suggest we do is after
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
one o'clock we all come back and talk
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
about the three amendments
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
and if we can
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
arrive at some kind of consensus about
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we could do
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
to try to achieve a compromise then
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
maybe at that point a motion to
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
reconsider the retaining
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
motion might be in order
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
if we talk about this for a couple of
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
hours and we determine hey there's no
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
compromise we can we can live with here
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
then there won't be any point in
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
reconsidering the retaining motion
 
01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:04.709 align:start position:0%
reconsidering the retaining motion
so

01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
let's all go have some lunch
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
maybe have a glass of wine with lunch
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
and be ready to discuss
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
the three amendments and see if we can
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
find some kind of weight compromise
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
so i'll see you all
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.790 align:start position:0%

02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:47.460 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:02.970 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:02.970 --> 02:56:13.429 align:start position:0%

02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:56:13.439 --> 02:56:22.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:22.590 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:38.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.070 --> 02:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
more more
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
now we know what's missing in our
 
02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:09.430 align:start position:0%
committee meetings music
 
02:57:09.430 --> 02:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
committee meetings music
[Music]

02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
i was in a band we used to close our
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:22.810 align:start position:0%
that one oh he knows it
 
02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:25.030 align:start position:0%
that one oh he knows it
[Music]

02:57:25.030 --> 02:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly
 
02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly
yep

02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
you don't know this one do you
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
i can't remember it
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
well it is 100
 
02:57:50.309 --> 02:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
2 so we can uh
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
get back together here and have some
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have three potential amendments for
 
02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
hb 106 that we could discuss we could
 
02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
discuss them
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
individually or we could just discuss i
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
think they all basically do the same
 
02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:08.389 align:start position:0%
think they all basically do the same
thing

02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
so we can just discuss the concept
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:58:16.830 --> 02:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
address what's your final does anybody
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:28.950 align:start position:0%
have a
suggestion

02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe a straw poll just to find out
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
who's willing to
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
make a vote other than retain
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
just a straw poll nothing
 
02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
that uh counts for anything other than
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get the discussion moving
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
well i personally couldn't
 
02:58:55.429 --> 02:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
make a decision about whether i would
 
02:58:58.230 --> 02:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
reconsider unless we had a compromise
 
02:58:58.240 --> 02:58:59.670 align:start position:0%
reconsider unless we had a compromise
position

02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:58:59.680 --> 02:59:00.790 align:start position:0%
position
so

02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
we need to see if we can come up with a
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
compromised position first and talk
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
about whether we
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
do a straw hole or even in fact do a
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
vote to be considered although
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
i see a lot of people missing right now
 
02:59:16.389 --> 02:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
 
02:59:16.399 --> 02:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
but

02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh representatives
 
02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:21.190 align:start position:0%
uh representatives
um

02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman uh it seems to me that
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to approach this would
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
be to ask for a straw pull up
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
is anyone willing to raise the cap
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
higher than one megawatt at this point
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
if we find majority doesn't want to go
 
02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
beyond that then
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think most of these amendments would
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable suggestion uh
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
let's do a straw poll to see how many
 
02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
people here would be willing to
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh mr clerk could you call the role of
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
the people in the building or in the uh
 
03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the call
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the meeting
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
news draw a poll i'll write down the
 
03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
news draw a poll i'll write down the
numbers

03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:17.110 --> 03:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
if you are willing to expand the cap
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
beyond what one megawatt you'll say yes
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you uh i
 
03:00:27.510 --> 03:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
just made some preliminary comments
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh beforehand
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough information right
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
now or is there enough time pass right
 
03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
now to make a
 
03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
substantive change
 
03:00:44.230 --> 03:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
so without more information or more talk
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
or even a little more time
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think anyone's positioned
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm still in favor of doing a truck stop
 
03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:58.230 align:start position:0%
i'm still in favor of doing a truck stop
hole

03:00:58.230 --> 03:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
hole
 
03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:03.190 align:start position:0%
hole
um

03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
who can't you hear
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:16.230 --> 03:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
i can hear him but i i i can't
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand him
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
his man's okay
 
03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
i nearly stated that
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
not enough time or information is passed
 
03:01:26.319 --> 03:01:27.110 align:start position:0%
not enough time or information is passed
for

03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
i believe an effective straw poll
 
03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:31.349 align:start position:0%
i believe an effective straw poll
so

03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
if in doubt or if you don't have more
 
03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:35.110 align:start position:0%
if in doubt or if you don't have more
information

03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh for me anyway i
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
i can't make an honest assessment i
 
03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
i can't make an honest assessment i
would

03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
so when i'm in doubt i always say no
 
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i think there's a distinction on
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
raising the limit on what the source of
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
the power is
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would have a different vote on hydro
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
versus solar or wind
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
i agree also representative kim burrows
 
03:02:07.110 --> 03:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes i i i was going to say the same
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
thing representative bernard said
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
i would vote differently depending on
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
what what the source is
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative i agree 100 with
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
okay so the question uh about raising
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
the cap above one megawatt is apparently
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
too simplistic a question
 
03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsic it looks like
 
03:02:31.990 --> 03:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's a consensus that
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
it would depend on whether it was
 
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
power was uh well i wanted to just
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that my motion was to take a
 
03:02:47.590 --> 03:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
a straw poll on raising
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
the net metering
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh only for municipalities
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
not for everybody
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that precludes a lot of projects that
 
03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
you can't really do
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
as a municipality so but i i i don't
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
want to get into the details of what
 
03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
which areas of net metering
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
should have individual separate caps i
 
03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:12.469 align:start position:0%
should have individual separate caps i
think

03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that is a big discussion and that's
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
a complicated discussion and not a very
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay representative mcgee
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair yeah i i was just
 
03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
gonna say that i i thought
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
um i i don't care if we take a straw
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
poll but i feel like
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't discuss the amendments we
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
might not get to any of the
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that we'd like people to
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
have about what is proposed
 
03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:44.710 align:start position:0%
have about what is proposed
um

03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
if the exception that representative
 
03:03:50.550 --> 03:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
bernardi made saying that
 
03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:51.590 align:start position:0%
bernardi made saying that
um

03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
solar net metering cap versus hydro give
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
him a different you know he has a
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
different position on whether it should
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
be raised
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
then i think it does warrant a
 
03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
then i think it does warrant a
discussion

03:04:03.030 --> 03:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:04:06.830 --> 03:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
so i i feel like we're back to
 
03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:08.710 align:start position:0%
so i i feel like we're back to
uh

03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
back to looking at the three amendments
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us
 
03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair i'm gonna withdraw my
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:24.389 --> 03:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh and the
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
request for us for off post withdrawn so
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're back to as representative mcgee
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
just pointed out
 
03:04:32.309 --> 03:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh maybe discussing the concrete
 
03:04:32.319 --> 03:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
uh maybe discussing the concrete
proposal

03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
there were at least three amendments
 
03:04:43.269 --> 03:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i have a copy of it here
 
03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.269 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i have a copy of it here
somewhere

03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then i believe representative pitts
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment
 
03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:52.630 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment
and

03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams i think
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
also proposed
 
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
so shall we start with yours mr chairman
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
found it
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
basically just put a cap in there that
 
03:05:13.359 --> 03:05:14.710 align:start position:0%
basically just put a cap in there that
said

03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's an approval over the five that was
 
03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.150 --> 03:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
but net metering is net metering is
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
let's put this this thing to rest once
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
and for all
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
about net metering
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you want to have an authoritative
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
ruling on this the public utilities
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
commission in 2017
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
already had a docket
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
docket order number
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
26029 on page 69
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
it states
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
little to no evidence of any significant
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
cost shifting due to net metering
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
so since that time no new investigation
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
has been done about this and the one of
 
03:06:30.790 --> 03:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the two reasons that this could be the
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
case is number one because there is no
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
net there is no shifting of costs
 
03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and number two is because the
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
penetration into the electric market by
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and net metering is so
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
small that whatever change it might
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
might result in is not measurable at
 
03:06:52.150 --> 03:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
this time so right now there is no
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that net metering has any cost
 
03:06:57.429 --> 03:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
shifting okay that is authoritative from
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative i would just respond that
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
that was in 2017 when there was highly
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
in existence since then has grown top
 
03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:12.710 align:start position:0%
in existence since then has grown top
deterred

03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
deterred
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's no way the psc would find the
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative plett's
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
assumption point that that was in 2017
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
there has been a substantial increase in
 
03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.510 align:start position:0%
there has been a substantial increase in
uh

03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
projects that have been proposed in
 
03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
maine because maine raised its net
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
metering cap to five megawatts and they
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
had so many projects
 
03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the queue that they actually had
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
to stop accepting interconnection
 
03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:46.469 align:start position:0%
to stop accepting interconnection
requests

03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
requests
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
and uh requested and then the puc
 
03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
and uh requested and then the puc
requested

03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
requested
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
that there be a study done
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh what the effect
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
of all this i think it was close to 700
 
03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
more than that i think it was more like
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
a thousand megawatts of new solar that
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
was proposed to come online in
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
in maine what the what the effect of
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
that was going to be as far as i know
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
that study is still ongoing but there
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
have been a plethora of other studies
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
around the country that have discovered
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
a substantial cost shift once you get
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
beyond a certain penetration movement
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
so then the question becomes well
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
if what is that penetration limit
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
and uh what should
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
we do about the potential of cost
 
03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:42.150 align:start position:0%
we do about the potential of cost
shifting

03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:43.349 align:start position:0%
shifting
so

03:08:43.349 --> 03:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's a legitimate question and a
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate point and i think it's the
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
reason why a lot of people
 
03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be uncomfortable
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:08:52.319 --> 03:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
with a
cat

03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
cat
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
lift all the way to five megawatts
 
03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
now it's true that in this particular
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
case because just the case of a
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
municipal host there's not going to be a
 
03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
municipal host there's not going to be a
huge

03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
huge
 
03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:05.830 align:start position:0%
huge
new

03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
penetration of solar
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
as a result of this bill
 
03:09:12.150 --> 03:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless
 
03:09:13.110 --> 03:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
an expansion of
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
net metering and if there's other
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
expansions of net metering that go on
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
we need to have a better understanding
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
of how that's going to affect
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
non-net metering
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
ratepayers before we proceed
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxendine is recognized
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i was not only an
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
intervener in that proceeding but i was
 
03:09:40.230 --> 03:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
the one who put in the bill that sent it
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
to the puc to begin with
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes we've had an authoritative ruling as
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
an interim measure from the puc that
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is currently and
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
we've had very little change in the
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
meager time that has passed since that
 
03:09:56.230 --> 03:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
report came out
 
03:09:58.389 --> 03:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
in the meantime synapse has come out
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
with a study of new england which
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the far-reaching benefits
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
of having greater clean energy on the
 
03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
of having greater clean energy on the
grid

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
grid
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
how it benefits all ratepayers because
 
03:10:15.030 --> 03:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's lowering demand it's lowering peaks
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
and it's lowering costs to ratepayers
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
the the notion that we need to be
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
worried about a situation where we have
 
03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
a thousand megawatts in the queue it's
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
being managed
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
in maine yo they say okay hold up the
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
queue and we'll work through them one at
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
a time
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
we are in the midst of a transition
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's an unprecedented transition but
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's a necessary transition and closing
 
03:10:48.230 --> 03:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
our eyes and pretending that we're not
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the midst of this transition is doing
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
a severe disservice to ratepayers and to
 
03:10:55.279 --> 03:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
a severe disservice to ratepayers and to
taxpayers

03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
if if
 
03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
manchester and concord and lebanon could
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
be proceeding with these
 
03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
plans that are all set to go forward
 
03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
they could be reducing local property
 
03:11:09.279 --> 03:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
they could be reducing local property
taxes

03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:11:12.230 --> 03:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is a measure that needs to go
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
through and it needs to go through with
 
03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
no cap up to ferc's involvement at five
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative kelly pitts
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
well uh my my i was wondering how do we
 
03:11:29.279 --> 03:11:30.469 align:start position:0%
well uh my my i was wondering how do we
know

03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
how it affects new hampshire i'm not
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
talking about massachusetts i'm not
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
talking about me if we don't open the
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
door a little bit new hampshire
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
we tried to
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
compromise there
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
there was a compromise on uh we try to
 
03:11:48.870 --> 03:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
compromise on how much is allowed one
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
two three ten whatever
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we say
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
or ask
 
03:11:57.190 --> 03:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
that within
 
03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
24 months
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
the puc opened a current or the buc open
 
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
the docket to study
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have one
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
what what has been going on recently and
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
what's gone on since
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
what will go on since we raised the cap
 
03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:18.710 align:start position:0%
what will go on since we raised the cap
and

03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
put a limit
 
03:12:23.429 --> 03:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
raise the cap for two years until we get
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
a definitive nancy from the puc there
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
are ways around this but there are also
 
03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
are ways around this but there are also
ways

03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
ways
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
to let
 
03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:32.469 align:start position:0%
to let
municipalities

03:12:32.469 --> 03:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead and proceed with projects that
 
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
they would like to do
 
03:12:40.230 --> 03:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking of the hydro and i'm
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
thinking of solar which of course takes
 
03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
up much more
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
land space or however you do it
 
03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
we need to come to some sort of a
 
03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:50.630 align:start position:0%
we need to come to some sort of a
consensus

03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
about what we can do and then how we can
 
03:12:55.110 --> 03:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
oversee what's being done and that's
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the puc but maybe we have to in
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
legislation asks them
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
to be the overseer and give us
 
03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
a report about what what's happening so
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
we can keep abreast of it
 
03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
we can keep abreast of it
um

03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the electric companies certainly
 
03:13:14.230 --> 03:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
because they have the information on
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
interconnection requests
 
03:13:20.230 --> 03:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i i think it's a doable i really do
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
how far you open the door i don't know
 
03:13:25.510 --> 03:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
that we need to move ahead on opening
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
the door rather than doing nothing for
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
the next year and then saying okay now
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
we have to crack the door a little bit
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think we have to allow some of these
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
projects to go ahead
 
03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:40.710 align:start position:0%
projects to go ahead
and

03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:42.309 --> 03:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
what you said this afternoon really
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
disturbed me this morning it disturbed
 
03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:46.150 align:start position:0%
disturbed me this morning it disturbed
me

03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:47.349 align:start position:0%
me
that

03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
there are people
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
who i have their heels dug in and i'm
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
not willing to listen at all
 
03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
not willing to listen at all
and

03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know how
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
we can do that unless we get everybody
 
03:13:59.279 --> 03:14:01.110 align:start position:0%
we can do that unless we get everybody
together

03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
not just the committee everybody
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
and discuss what we need to do
 
03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:08.630 align:start position:0%
and discuss what we need to do
um

03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
all the interested parties
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
include municipalities and not for a
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
three second sound bite to really work
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
out and discuss what we need to do
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know how
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's like a kid
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's like a child i'm not gonna do it
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm never gonna do it and i won't do
 
03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:27.429 align:start position:0%
and i'm never gonna do it and i won't do
it

03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:14:27.439 --> 03:14:28.469 align:start position:0%
it
well

03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that point instead of
 
03:14:32.790 --> 03:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
beating the core out of the child you
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
you thought let's talk about this why
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
won't you do it
 
03:14:39.510 --> 03:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
what's your motivation why why won't you
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
do it and very often not always but very
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
often you'll get more
 
03:14:46.469 --> 03:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
you just don't want to well but that's
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
not good enough and you can turn
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
something around
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
with the proper discussion but if you
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the discussion it's not going
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um just building on
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
to the previous discussion of the sort
 
03:15:12.790 --> 03:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
of net effects of of net metering um i
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
feel like the
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're concerned about cost
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
shifting onto the the rate payer um from
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
my perspective what we're doing right
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
now is cost shifting away from
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
potential generation that could be there
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're just sitting here with our thumb
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the scale saying no you can't produce
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
power here we're not gonna let you
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
compete on this market we're not going
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
to let you provide
 
03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:38.710 align:start position:0%
to let you provide
extra

03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
extra
 
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
extra energy and
 
03:15:42.229 --> 03:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
everybody that i talked to you know when
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
i canvassed two years ago when i first
 
03:15:46.710 --> 03:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
got elected said they want more local
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
energy they want clean energy this is
 
03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
like a number one concern of of my
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
constituents so um i'm in agreement with
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
lee that that i think we need to go as
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
far as as ferc will let us um with this
 
03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:01.190 align:start position:0%
far as as ferc will let us um with this
but

03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know if we can compromise
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to to come back a little bit
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
from that but but we clearly need to
 
03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
move on from where we are now thank you
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd just like to clarify one
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
thing that you said um
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
you implied that if we don't raise the
 
03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
cap on net metering that people can't
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
build anything larger than one megawatt
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's not true
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
you can build
 
03:16:28.830 --> 03:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
as large a system as you want
 
03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
today it has nothing to do with the net
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
metering cap
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
fidelity investments over in merrimack
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
built a 3.1 megawatt solar farm on their
 
03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
built a 3.1 megawatt solar farm on their
property

03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
and they use the electricity from that
 
03:16:45.269 --> 03:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
farm to offset 20 percent of the
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
electricity that their campus uses
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that prevents a
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
company or an individual or a city or
 
03:16:54.239 --> 03:16:55.349 align:start position:0%
company or an individual or a city or
town

03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:16:57.190 --> 03:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
building a solar system
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
of two three four
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
up to five megawatts
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing that net metering does is
 
03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
it provides a little some additional
 
03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:08.229 align:start position:0%
it provides a little some additional
revenue

03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the individual
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
owner of that
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
solar system or that uh alternative
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy system to earn a little
 
03:17:21.190 --> 03:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
bit more money
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
may i follow up sorry
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
but so that that power just goes back
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
for free
 
03:17:35.190 --> 03:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
into the grid correct if there's not net
 
03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:38.070 align:start position:0%
into the grid correct if there's not net
metering

03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
depends uh if you want to put power back
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
on the grid and you contact the utility
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and ask the utility to give you a credit
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
for it
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
they probably will
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
but the credit they'll offer you is
 
03:17:52.150 --> 03:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
probably closer to the wholesale price
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
than the
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
prices that the net readering
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
statute currently offers
 
03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
for those net metering credits
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
another thing that i would point out
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to a comment that
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
jackie califitz made
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
there is an ongoing docket at the pnc
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
about the net meter and tariff it's been
 
03:18:13.750 --> 03:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
open since
 
03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:16.710 align:start position:0%
open since
2016.

03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's been open for a long time and they
 
03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:21.269 align:start position:0%
it's been open for a long time and they
have

03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
started a bunch of different
 
03:18:26.070 --> 03:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
many studies
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
to help them arrive at
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
an overall
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
decision on what the proper net metering
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
tariff should be and those studies are
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
still ongoing and until they're
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
completed they will come up with a
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
final and definitive
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
decision about what that metering should
 
03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
decision about what that metering should
be

03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
why can't renewable
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
energy compete at wholesale levels
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and what would be so there's
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
incentives now
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
for people to set up uh renewable energy
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then that removes the incentive to
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
try and make it more efficient so that
 
03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
it can compete at wholesale levels
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
what would be the incentive
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
for for it to be more efficient if you
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to and you still make money
 
03:19:23.429 --> 03:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
anybody want to take a stab at that
 
03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
anybody want to take a stab at that
representation

03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
may we make it give it an expiration
 
03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
date then um if that's our concern is
 
03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
that people aren't working toward it i
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean i think you're you're always going
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be working towards making it better
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
if that's a concern i you know i'd be
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
open to working on them
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
i already had a hand up but
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
my thought on the wholesale idea in
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
terms of value
 
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:19:58.150 --> 03:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
um i mean that is a crucial question
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
that the public utilities commission and
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
the folks who price
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh energy
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out which is what
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
is the accurate value for this
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional energy that can be supplied
 
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
near the source it does have a value
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
though and so the idea of saying well we
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to open up and allow net
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
metering because we're afraid
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
that somebody's gonna
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know make money they shouldn't
 
03:20:24.630 --> 03:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
um but if they're producing energy that
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
can be used then it does have a value
 
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i think this committee is woefully
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
ill prepared to decide what that value
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
is there are other people that are doing
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
that piece of the work but to say that
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
there is no legitimate value or that you
 
03:20:40.950 --> 03:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
know i mean i think that's part of the
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
problem here is we can't figure out
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's one two three five because
 
03:20:45.279 --> 03:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
whether it's one two three five because
we're

03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about the value and we
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out a good way to talk
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves about it
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think there's enough evidence out
 
03:20:57.750 --> 03:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
there that there's significant value to
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
having local sustainable energy and i
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
know in my town we've made a bunch of
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
investments and we would certainly
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
see a reduction in local property taxes
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
if we were able to recover the renewable
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
energy credits between the one megawatt
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we're capped at now and uh you know
 
03:21:17.590 --> 03:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
four or five wherever it is that um all
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
plant together would come to if we had
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
if we were able to take each of the one
 
03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh two mega well two megawatt
 
03:21:26.479 --> 03:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh two mega well two megawatt
um

03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
installations that we have and net meter
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
them then that would just bring the cost
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
down for everybody because it would go
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
off of the municipal electricity bill
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
that all of us contribute to so there's
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways to look at the
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
money piece of this we haven't had any
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
of those discussions so right now people
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
just think what they think
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't bother to get answers to those
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions which is something we could do
 
03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
if we had had more work groups on that
 
03:21:53.190 --> 03:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i think to just dismiss it out of
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
hand and say well renewables different
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't you know shouldn't be
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
default should be wholesale why isn't it
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
wholesale wholesale
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
prices are lower because the people who
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
generated wholesale generate a lot
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
right so if you're under five megawatts
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
you don't qualify for wholesale that's
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
why that's an answer
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
but there's other answers too because
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's complicated so
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
i would say there is a value to this
 
03:22:16.239 --> 03:22:17.670 align:start position:0%
i would say there is a value to this
energy

03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
and us not even getting into the
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
place where we're able to look at it and
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
have data from it in our own state
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
prevents us from being able to have the
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
analysis that we need to say how much is
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
the right penetration point where we
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
would cut it off because we're we're
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
just nowhere near that we really we
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
haven't run any experiment yet we're a
 
03:22:38.319 --> 03:22:40.229 align:start position:0%
haven't run any experiment yet we're a
pilot

03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative griffin yes uh
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mcgee for
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
your response
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that this committee
 
03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
can't uh you know doesn't have the
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
resources to determine the appropriate
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
value i would argue that no committee
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
can determine the appropriate value that
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
we are not a command economy and that
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
the free market should determine the
 
03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
value and then
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
pay more or not on their own thank you
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
can i just
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i have no problem with the
 
03:23:10.710 --> 03:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
free market being involved but the fact
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
is there's a very sophisticated
 
03:23:16.389 --> 03:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
tariff system because there are so many
 
03:23:16.399 --> 03:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
tariff system because there are so many
different

03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
variables that are being taken into
 
03:23:23.110 --> 03:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
consideration when pricing happens in
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
the energy market so
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is we don't have
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
expertise in setting those pricings on
 
03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
this committee i i think our committee
 
03:23:34.870 --> 03:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility and the
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
capability and the wherewithal to get
 
03:23:39.269 --> 03:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
that information and to get more answers
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
if we ask the right questions i i don't
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
think we've been given the time to do
 
03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:44.630 align:start position:0%
think we've been given the time to do
that

03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't you think uh representative mcgee
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't want a quest to want an
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
answer from you but
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't you think it's reasonable for this
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
make a judgment
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that it is not good policy
 
03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
for one set of rate payers to have to
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
subsidize another secretary affairs and
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
i think that's what's at the base of
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
this question representative
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
90 years ago we established the women's
 
03:24:16.950 --> 03:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
state's a wholesale electricity market
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh nepo stated uh it's running this
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
system to a new entity called iceland
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
new england and nice and normal reports
 
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
to nepal but isolation has been trying
 
03:24:29.190 --> 03:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
to do that but ever since we did that
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
instead of a wholesale market we've been
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
under money we've been undermining it by
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
net metering and by subsidies here and
 
03:24:39.190 --> 03:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's there wrecks and uh best reps
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
and all these subsidies undermining the
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
market and part of the reason
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
electricity is so cheap now is because
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
the market being undercut
 
03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we're having this stuff come up it's
 
03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
and we're having this stuff come up it's
not

03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
controlled by isil new england at all
 
03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:55.190 align:start position:0%
controlled by isil new england at all
itself

03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
as a price taker
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
and it gets subsidized if the market's
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
not on your last mistake it's going to
 
03:25:06.309 --> 03:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.990 --> 03:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxendine you're
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you very much um as the
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
chair mentioned the pucs proceeding on
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
on this issue is ongoing we are about to
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
get the um the rfp has been put out for
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
a value of solar study here in new
 
03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:24.870 align:start position:0%
a value of solar study here in new
hampshire

03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
we should be allowing that proceeding to
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
go forward but
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
certainly recognizing at the moment
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
there is no unsubsidized energy market
 
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars in subsidies of oil
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
and gas have been going on for decades
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
renewable energy has been incentivized
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
we we have a very complex market and
 
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we have experts who do the
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
rate setting our job is to do policy
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
setting not to get down into the
 
03:25:56.790 --> 03:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the wholesale market and
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
which parts are are in there but we do
 
03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
have a very recent study put out which
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
looks at the value of solar in our
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
regional market and tells us at a
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
minimum it's worth 12 cents per kilowatt
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
hour whereas the wholesale rate is at
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
2.5 or 3 cents per kilowatt hour
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
this is a a a number that is in line
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
with the puc's finding of no significant
 
03:26:29.830 --> 03:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
cost shifting this is a number we can
 
03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
work with and many of many of our towns
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and cities are prepared to go forward
 
03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:36.790 align:start position:0%
and cities are prepared to go forward
with

03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
in a way that can help ratepayers and
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
help taxpayers we need to be assisting
 
03:26:45.190 --> 03:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
those municipalities
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
and our ratepayers and taxpayers in
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
moving ahead we have sufficient
 
03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
information and we're going to get more
 
03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i think most economists would
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
tell you that something is worth what
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
people are willing to pay for it
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
we have monopoly i'm sorry
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
what we're debating here is what we
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
think people will be willing to pay for
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel is recognized
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman first of all this
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
is not a
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
free market as far as energy it's a
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
regulated market
 
03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
regulated market
so

03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we have the puc and to
 
03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:27.269 align:start position:0%
um you know we have the puc and to
determine

03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
those rates
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
but also i wanted to bring up
 
03:27:33.990 --> 03:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that what we're talking about
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
is a very limited bill
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with municipalities
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
and county government
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i suppose i have no idea if state
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
government would be included in this or
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
not i probably
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
but it
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
at any rate
 
03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
at any rate
um

03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about cost shifting from
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
and if if you were talking about
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
municipality and county government
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
all part of we are all citizens of our
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
own towns our own counties and so
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
if there is any rate shifting here it's
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
shifting it from us to us
 
03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:18.630 align:start position:0%
shifting it from us to us
so

03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:18.640 --> 03:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
so
as

03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
pilot project and that's what this is
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
really there's a pilot project it's a
 
03:28:27.990 --> 03:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
pretty safe one
 
03:28:29.830 --> 03:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's
 
03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:31.750 align:start position:0%
and i think it's
worth

03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh opening the doors a little bit
 
03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:35.910 align:start position:0%
uh opening the doors a little bit
um

03:28:35.910 --> 03:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
let's seeing what will happen
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
in the market
 
03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
when we do that
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
this is a risk well worth taking it's
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to increase our renewable
 
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio which is a good thing for
 
03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:52.469 align:start position:0%
portfolio which is a good thing for
everybody

03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's what i think thank you
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd react to that by saying
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's not just a transfer from us to us
 
03:29:05.349 --> 03:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's a transfer from the taxpayers of
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
one town to
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers of all other towns
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i think my hand was held up in
 
03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
sorry i think my hand was held up in
error

03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think it was just up from previously i
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
apologize representative callie bits
 
03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:41.429 align:start position:0%
apologize representative callie bits
well

03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
if the if the discussion as you
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
as was proposed before was about
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
subsidies we subsidize everything in
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
every way
 
03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
then the state shouldn't be paying
 
03:29:53.830 --> 03:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
anything we subsidize companies to come
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
in through different benefits and we
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
subsidize schools because local towns
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
just can't do it right
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
so if we call it a subsidy we can call
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
it assistance we want to call it help we
 
03:30:07.190 --> 03:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
want to give it a different name
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is not a subsidy
 
03:30:12.389 --> 03:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
we are trying nobody is getting rich on
 
03:30:12.399 --> 03:30:13.269 align:start position:0%
we are trying nobody is getting rich on
this

03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:30:13.279 --> 03:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
this
nobody

03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities are not going
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
to risk
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
the money from their citizens because
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
they all want to get reelected so
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to come up with a
 
03:30:25.359 --> 03:30:26.229 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to come up with a
pretty

03:30:26.229 --> 03:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
concrete plan of what this is going to
 
03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:29.590 align:start position:0%
concrete plan of what this is going to
do

03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to do it
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that you know stopping them
 
03:30:37.190 --> 03:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
from making that decision
 
03:30:39.750 --> 03:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
is totally unconscionable we have to
 
03:30:42.550 --> 03:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
allow something and the fact that a
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
docket has been open in the puc
 
03:30:45.359 --> 03:30:46.269 align:start position:0%
docket has been open in the puc
since

03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:30:46.279 --> 03:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
since
2017

03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
2017
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
is also unconscionable who's subsidizing
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
the puc every single one of us because
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's funded by the electric companies
 
03:30:55.680 --> 03:30:56.710 align:start position:0%
it's funded by the electric companies
so

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
five years to study something if you had
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
in private sector five years to study
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
something by the time you finish
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
studying it's out of date you gotta
 
03:31:04.950 --> 03:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
study it again
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i think that we need to
 
03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
get moving and then we need to
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
get some concrete evidence about what is
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
the effect of new hampshire
 
03:31:17.590 --> 03:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
we don't even know if the town of
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon will go through with something
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
once it hears all the parameters we
 
03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think we really have to look at
 
03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
so i i think we really have to look at
that

03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
and allow
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
concrete evidence to come in nobody
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.720 --> 03:31:36.469 align:start position:0%
 
nobody

03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to cut out
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
the people this will help the people who
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
can't put up
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
solar arrays who don't have a river
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
running in the backyard that they can
 
03:31:47.120 --> 03:31:48.150 align:start position:0%
running in the backyard that they can
tap

03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
tap
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're not helping just
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
the cities the big cities and towns
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
helping the people in those cities and
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
towns and i think that's what we have
 
03:31:57.120 --> 03:31:58.469 align:start position:0%
towns and i think that's what we have
about

03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:32:00.150 --> 03:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
we can put all kinds of limits on this
 
03:32:00.160 --> 03:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
we can put all kinds of limits on this
stuff

03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:32:05.670 --> 03:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
but we need to help the people right now
 
03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to help them with jobs and
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
getting out of a jam
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know why we want to call it
 
03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:13.429 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know why we want to call it
subsidizing

03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
subsidizing
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody could get rich doing it you
 
03:32:18.070 --> 03:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
better believe or i better believe that
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
it would have been done
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i was just going
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
to piggyback on the idea of
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
the the portfolio because i think that's
 
03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
another consideration that we haven't
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
really talked about as a committee
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
i know when i started paying attention
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire energy
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
it was a big concept that portfolio
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
diversity was something that the policy
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
makers at the state level and in the
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
then office of energy planning were very
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
concerned with the fact that we didn't
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
want to have a monopoly of any one
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
particular fuel type that we wanted to
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that we maintained diversity
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
and basically managed the pieces of the
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
portfolio so if you wanted to clean up
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
the the power plants which we have done
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
right the coal and oil plants have been
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
really minimized and and uh translated
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
over to gas and in some cases but
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
basically the idea is that that was
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
one way that people who were doing
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
policy could look at what the makeup was
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and decide what changes
 
03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
they were going to make
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
the renewable
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
portion of the portfolio has been
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
maintained at under one percent it's
 
03:33:44.830 --> 03:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
very minuscule
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we have been fighting ourselves for
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
quite a while trying to figure out how
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
we broaden that so that we can give
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
that competition
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh maintain diversity
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
and also increase the sectors that
 
03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
contribute to clean
 
03:34:03.279 --> 03:34:04.229 align:start position:0%
contribute to clean
power

03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
and so there's a number of drivers for
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
it that provide it with value to the
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
state that is not just
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
whatever's being
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
paid to people to credit them for the
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
value of the energy that they're
 
03:34:16.160 --> 03:34:17.190 align:start position:0%
value of the energy that they're
producing

03:34:17.190 --> 03:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
producing
 
03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:18.229 align:start position:0%
producing
but

03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can't get something for nothing
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
right and so the idea that well they can
 
03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
in they can invest in it even if they
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't get anything back for it that's
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
true but most people will invest based
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the return of investment and a lot of
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
people have been dissuaded from
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
investing in clean energy for themselves
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
or in their towns because of this very
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
thing because we're not making it an
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
economic decision that works for people
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:43.349 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
my argument would be
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
that because we're not looking at the
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
things that many of the people who come
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
and testify before us they give us these
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
examples they give us concrete evidence
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
of of the benefits um that there will be
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
to towns to states and to local property
 
03:35:03.190 --> 03:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
taxes which to me
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's a really big charge no matter
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
what party you are that's what we that's
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we're trying to
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
get more support for renewable local
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy is because
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's the only mechanism that we have at
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
our disposal i think to actually help
 
03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
our disposal i think to actually help
lower

03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
lower
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh what people are paying and so that
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be my argument is that we're not
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
giving enough
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why people are trying
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
to do renewables there's a reason behind
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
all of it and just trying to hold back
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that dam of all the people that are all
 
03:35:36.870 --> 03:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
the pent up projects
 
03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
the pent up projects
um

03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's it is doing a disservice
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
it is doing a disservice it's it's us
 
03:35:45.190 --> 03:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
standing in the way of
 
03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:46.389 align:start position:0%
standing in the way of
of

03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
an economic
 
03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:49.269 align:start position:0%
an economic
um

03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say boom because i don't
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
think it would be that much but there's
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of pent-up demand and
 
03:35:55.920 --> 03:35:56.790 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of pent-up demand and
um

03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i haven't heard any arguments
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
that are adequate
 
03:36:02.790 --> 03:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
to holding back that demand i think that
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
we work for the people and to jackie's
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
point the people have been asking us for
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
this for years
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh because they're trying to get on with
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in order to lower
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
their expenses at the town level and
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh we can help them or we can hurt them
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
and right now we're not doing anything
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
so should we get back to the
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
bills uh like to the the the
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
the amount i mean the amendments the
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
levels of the amendments can we
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
can we bring the talk back to
 
03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
can we bring the talk back to
y

03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
y
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
y one y two y three by
 
03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:35.590 align:start position:0%
y one y two y three by
because

03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:36:37.349 --> 03:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
there have to be reasons
 
03:36:37.359 --> 03:36:38.389 align:start position:0%
there have to be reasons
peter

03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
peter
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
you knew that i i was glad to hear you
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
echoed the comments of the mayor of
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
lebanon last year
 
03:36:45.439 --> 03:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
lebanon last year
that

03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
everybody wants solar but nobody wants
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for it
 
03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
did i say that i don't remember saying
 
03:36:53.439 --> 03:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
did i say that i don't remember saying
that

03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
this discussion but yes we can get back
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
to uh discussing a specific bill
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
or a specific amendment
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
03:37:05.279 --> 03:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
sure um
representative

03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:09.190 align:start position:0%
representative
yes

03:37:09.190 --> 03:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:37:11.670 --> 03:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
at the risk of sounding childish in some
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
people's views
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
increasing subsidies is a good thing and
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
so we're wasting your time here
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussing megawatt levels i don't want
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
metering at all
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
i just think it's it's a rate payer
 
03:37:26.479 --> 03:37:27.590 align:start position:0%
i just think it's it's a rate payer
ripoff

03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
ripoff
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
to subsidize certain entities over other
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
publications period
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative samson you wanted to
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
chime in
 
03:37:37.760 --> 03:37:38.630 align:start position:0%
chime in
uh

03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:41.670 --> 03:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i i i noticed you a very
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
cleverly said let's let's discuss your
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment first but i'd like to see you
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'll do that as soon as i hear from
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative creation
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um going back a bit
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
to lee's point about the fact that we
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
subsidize literally everything i feel
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about in the future all the
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
cleanup that we are going to need to do
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
over fossil fuels all of the investment
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we have to make in doing these
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
things what
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
taking care of these externalities what
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
is that if not continuing to subsidize
 
03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:18.389 align:start position:0%
is that if not continuing to subsidize
um

03:38:18.389 --> 03:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know through
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
government investment and and through
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
all these things that we need to do and
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
through diminished quality of life for
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
our kids subsidizing a very small number
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
of people who um
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
you know who are investing in this thing
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i i think just looking at
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
this one policy
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
in isolation we really need to see the
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture of where we need to
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
move to and stop subsidizing things that
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pay for even more
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
down the line
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
so representative samsung
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on your request that i justify
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
my amendment because you'll recall
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe you weren't here i don't
 
03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
or maybe you weren't here i don't
remember

03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
when i introduced this amendment i
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
introduced it as a way to stimulate
 
03:39:08.229 --> 03:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
discussion to see if there was any way
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
we could come to some kind of a
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
compromise on
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:39:14.399 --> 03:39:16.070 align:start position:0%
this issue
and

03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
i put together this amendment just as a
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
way to
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
generate that discussion i was
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
particularly interested at the time
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
we could do something that wouldn't
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
generate a significant floor
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
and it became clear to me after our
 
03:39:38.319 --> 03:39:40.389 align:start position:0%
and it became clear to me after our
discussion

03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
was it last friday i think it was last
 
03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
was it last friday i think it was last
friday

03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
friday
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't going to happen
 
03:39:46.239 --> 03:39:47.429 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't going to happen
so

03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
that was why
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
this morning i didn't
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this amendment because it
 
03:39:54.239 --> 03:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this amendment because it
had

03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
my judgment done what i
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
set out to achieve which is
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
to discover if there was any possibility
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
of a way we could we could uh arrive at
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of consensus and last friday
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
there was no consensus and so
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
to me that meant that
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to get anywhere with
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
this event
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
so that was justification for for
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
submitting this amendment well you
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
certainly have stimulated discussion
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
with that that succeeded
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
that is true we have simulated the
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
discussions stimulated
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
well so then we should move on to the
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
other amendments that are out there sure
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to discuss the other
 
03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to discuss the other
amendments

03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see one was from representative
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
callie pitts uh
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you want to
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
discuss your amendment
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah being very very very discouraged
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
about not wanting to talk and not
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
wanting to compromise and going from one
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
two three
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think i made the comment to
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative mckee did we take a dart
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
board and decide what it should be one
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
two three four five ten whatever
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i thought well let me do some simple
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
first grade math
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
take five divide it in half and round up
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
and come out with three
 
03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:16.150 align:start position:0%
and come out with three
and

03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's a
 
03:41:20.080 --> 03:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's a
overly

03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
overly
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
exaggerated amount i think that's amount
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
that it's workable i think that's an
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
amount that is probably workable for
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
nashua so that they can get some
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
use out of their news and falls
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
i think that
we

03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
need to really open up the discussion i
 
03:41:44.309 --> 03:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
don't think any one of us
 
03:41:44.319 --> 03:41:45.429 align:start position:0%
don't think any one of us
including

03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
including
 
03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
those of us who supported five in the
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
past or whatever know what is a proper
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
number we just know we don't want it to
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
run them up
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want it to get out of hand and
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
we want the puc to oversee it and i
 
03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
think that just simply changing
 
03:42:02.239 --> 03:42:03.030 align:start position:0%
think that just simply changing
the

03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the megawatts so that we actually get a
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
project that may be meaningful
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we could really study
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and see what the effects are
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that was my motivation and that's
 
03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
and that was my motivation and that's
all

03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing sinister
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
nothing in the background but i think
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.389 --> 03:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
i received an email
 
03:42:34.399 --> 03:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
i received an email
from

03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
cleaning adventures
 
03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:39.429 align:start position:0%
cleaning adventures
on

03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:42:39.439 --> 03:42:40.630 align:start position:0%
on
the

03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that i submitted last friday
 
03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
amendment that i submitted last friday
on

03:42:45.030 --> 03:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
hb 106
 
03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
hb 106
and

03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:52.150 --> 03:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
she was concerned that the two megawatt
 
03:42:55.510 --> 03:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
limit would exclude small hydro projects
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently between two and five
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts right
 
03:43:01.460 --> 03:43:01.470 align:start position:0%
that was concerned she had
 
03:43:01.470 --> 03:43:04.389 align:start position:0%
that was concerned she had
[Music]

03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
she also was concerned about a couple of
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
solar projects
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
that were less than or greater than
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
watts like concord gary manchester king
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
dover franklin and salem
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
just to name a few
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.150 --> 03:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
she had a concern about making it
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
within a municipality
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
so those were concerns that she had she
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
also pointed out that there is a similar
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
senate bill 109
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
so she said at this point we would
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
prefer that hb 106 be retained
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
rather than passed with the proposed 2
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i just thought i would i would pass
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
along those
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that she had
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
to add to the
 
03:44:07.279 --> 03:44:12.950 align:start position:0%
to add to the
discussion

03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
and that brings a good point to the
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're looking at now from
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative cali pitts which is that
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
three would be more acceptable than two
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
because there are
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
existing facilities who would be
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
borrowed from net metering
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
um based on their status of being over
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
two and i very poorly tried to describe
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
that in our work session and didn't get
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
it out there but i guess if you're
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
if you're if your production capacity is
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
above the two
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
meter cap then you're not able to
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
net meter for a percentage of what you
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
generate uh so you it has to be
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
the net metering cap has to be above
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
your generation capability so
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
it it it is good that clean energy new
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire at least has the details of
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
the landscape that they can provide you
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
or provide us to let us know that there
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
are actual facilities out there that are
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
going to be affected by this and that
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
would be an argument to say
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot right if it's
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities not everybody it's not
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
opening up net metering for everybody
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
who wants it it's just
 
03:45:26.439 --> 03:45:28.150 align:start position:0%
who wants it it's just
municipalities

03:45:28.150 --> 03:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh who have it already invested
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
basically i mean there may be some that
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
decide to invest or have projects
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
pending that they would like to invest
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
in but uh it's gonna
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's gonna
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
increase the margin of their
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
return on investment
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
and allow them to give immediate savings
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
back to their ratepayers because it's
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
going to lower the cost of the energy
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
that they use to run their buildings
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
their municipal buildings and schools or
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever's part of their
 
03:45:58.000 --> 03:45:58.790 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever's part of their
um

03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:58.800 --> 03:45:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
facility

03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:01.110 align:start position:0%
facility
so

03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's my understanding and my
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
reason for supporting the idea of
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
getting something through this year i
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
think it would be uh
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
it would be a huge
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
improvement that
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
many people would give us credit for and
 
03:46:17.120 --> 03:46:18.229 align:start position:0%
many people would give us credit for and
and

03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is i mean hb 106 was
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
1402 last time it was a bill that the
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
governor asked for at up to five
 
03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:28.870 align:start position:0%
governor asked for at up to five
so

03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
us putting it through i think the house
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
there are people in the house who won't
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
want net metering no matter what just
 
03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
like there's people on the committee
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
that just feel that way
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
the house also looks to us to give them
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know to give them the reasoning of
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's good or not and why and i
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
think we can make the argument that a
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
three megawatt cap is extremely
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable and
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
and also this is a very limited bill to
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
to representative pimentel's um original
 
03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
to representative pimentel's um original
point

03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
which is that it's it's not opening up
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
net metering for anybody that wants it
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's just saying municipalities that are
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
investing here
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
you can
 
03:47:11.830 --> 03:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
save money now
 
03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what they want to do and
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be trying to help
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure my town would be thrilled if
 
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
they could save some more money and uh
 
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
and show people that the investments
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
that their energy committee
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
incited them to make
 
03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
are actually going to pay off some more
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that's how i look at it and um you
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
raised an interesting point
 
03:47:33.439 --> 03:47:34.180 align:start position:0%
raised an interesting point
representative

03:47:34.180 --> 03:47:34.190 align:start position:0%

03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:35.750 align:start position:0%

[Music]

03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
that point being
 
03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
that point being
[Music]

03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities are interested in
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
my question would be
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
what is holding them back because if
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
they built a
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
three megawatt solar system then that's
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
three megawatts of electricity they
 
03:47:57.670 --> 03:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to buy from their utility so
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would save money
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
my guess is that what holds them back is
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
the acquisition costs of buying
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of these systems
 
03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
one of these systems
so

03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
would you be open
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
do you think many people would be open
 
03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
a cap in the bill
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
once your acquisition costs
 
03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:23.510 align:start position:0%
once your acquisition costs
are

03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh capitalized once you've bought your
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
solar system then your
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
you would no longer be allowed to net
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
meter your excess energy well wouldn't
 
03:48:39.269 --> 03:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
you still be contributing
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
so now you just enjoy energy
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
the uh yeah doing the whole rate and
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
just enjoy the fact that you don't have
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
to buy the electricity anymore but
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
you've paid for your system with that
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
i i understand what you're saying you're
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
saying once your return on investment is
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
recaptured then maybe you shouldn't be
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
getting any credit anymore but you would
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
still be delivering energy that would
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
lower the load for everybody and lower
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of fuels from outside the
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
state that would need to be imported so
 
03:49:06.640 --> 03:49:07.349 align:start position:0%
state that would need to be imported so
if

03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
if more municipalities were producing
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
energy that's locally sourced and
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
creating local jobs and blah blah you
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
know it would it would lower overall
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
cost because the amount of fuel that
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
would need to be imported would go down
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
the costs overall would because once
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
you've made that investment you don't
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
have future investments for another 20
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
25 years so
 
03:49:30.720 --> 03:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
25 years so
um

03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
a savings once you've made that recoup
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's something that could be
 
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
looked at but i don't think we're
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to put that in this bill like i
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we understand the
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
implications of having a cap that says
 
03:49:44.550 --> 03:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
you no longer can make money for the
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
energy that you're producing once you've
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
made back the investment that you paid
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
out to put it in place because i know in
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
the case of my town my town already made
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
their investments so i don't know how
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
far along they are on the continuum of
 
03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:00.950 align:start position:0%
far along they are on the continuum of
recouping

03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
recouping
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
but the investments that they made but i
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
know that they are concerned that they
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't have the ability to net meter
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
to a sufficient level that they
 
03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:10.710 align:start position:0%
to a sufficient level that they
can

03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh lower the costs where they thought
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
they would be able to because they
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand that generating that
 
03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
electricity actually has a value that
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
they should be able to recover
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
well most towns if they put in a three
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar facility
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would cost three million dollars to
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
build the facility and i don't think
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
most towns could afford to pay for that
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
without bonding over 20 or maybe even 30
 
03:50:34.479 --> 03:50:35.429 align:start position:0%
without bonding over 20 or maybe even 30
years

03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost for such a system would
 
03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:40.469 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost for such a system would
be

03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
dragged out or spread out over a fairly
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
the other issue is you put up a 3 milli
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar system you're going to
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
need at least 15 maybe 20 acres of land
 
03:50:51.840 --> 03:50:53.670 align:start position:0%
need at least 15 maybe 20 acres of land
and

03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
then you have to go through the planning
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
the sighting process
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
and as a member of a planning board in
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
my town i know that
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
citing that development of any kind is
 
03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.550 --> 03:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
zoning regulatory barriers that you have
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
to hurdle
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
and then you have a butter issues and
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
they can be very
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
so acquisition
 
03:51:19.520 --> 03:51:20.229 align:start position:0%
so acquisition
the

03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
project like that can be very very
 
03:51:22.319 --> 03:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
project like that can be very very
involved

03:51:24.150 --> 03:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:25.189 align:start position:0%
involved
and

03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
i agree i i'm on the zoning board in my
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
town and i understand that all of those
 
03:51:32.790 --> 03:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
issues play in um
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
but i i think we have examples and
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
madeline tried to give you some of them
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
that people are already investing and
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
trying to move forward so
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's a question of whether we're helping
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
them or hindering them
 
03:51:44.880 --> 03:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
them or hindering them
that's

03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're the only ones that can help in
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
terms of giving them a stable
 
03:51:54.389 --> 03:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
environment in terms of the policy that
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
they can understand if we keep you know
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
changing it and throwing it up in the
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
air it's really hard for them to
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand what they should be doing
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
they think they're doing what they
 
03:52:04.630 --> 03:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
should be doing but they're waiting for
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
signals from us as well i think that's
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
how i look at it from the people i've
 
03:52:11.670 --> 03:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
alright the risk of you and i getting
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
into one debate
 
03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
offline i'm going to ask representative
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
mick williams to weigh in with her
 
03:52:19.359 --> 03:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
mick williams to weigh in with her
opinion

03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
try to unmute if you can
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear you now
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
excellent um
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
i i want to point out that i represent
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh the west side of concord and the city
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
reducing our electric supply to
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
non-carbon sources which means the city
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
is looking right now to put in a very
 
03:52:52.150 --> 03:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
large solar array um they have the land
 
03:52:55.830 --> 03:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're ready to go but this bill would
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
make a huge amount of difference
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of incentivizing the
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
municipality to do it and yes i would
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
say many times that they could do it
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
without this bill and they may just do
 
03:53:06.399 --> 03:53:07.269 align:start position:0%
without this bill and they may just do
that

03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
but when we look at what our role is as
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
state representatives to support our
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our elected role to
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
help them not hinder them
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
i would say that that is the number one
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is to help our
 
03:53:21.279 --> 03:53:23.110 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is to help our
municipalities

03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:53:25.830 --> 03:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
to enable them to become
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
free this is a freedom issue where they
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
can produce their own electricity to
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
offset their own costs and it's not
 
03:53:32.399 --> 03:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
offset their own costs and it's not
about

03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
more for them less for someone else it's
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
about reducing costs for individual
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities so they can spend the
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
money elsewhere
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
so yes the puc is still working on
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
coming up with a number for what is
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for our economy in new
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a number of uh net
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
metering whether it's five or three or
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
some other number
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
but at this point we've been debating
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
this for over four years and i think we
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
all know that we're not going to come to
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
a perfect consensus we need to come to
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
something that can work
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i i am happy to put the time in to
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
come up with something that can work
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want this to just be a one-sided
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is how it's going to be i think
 
03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
there is a compromise in the middle path
 
03:54:16.399 --> 03:54:17.189 align:start position:0%
there is a compromise in the middle path
um

03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to note that i did call
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives um
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
and requested that the director join us
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone in the guest list
 
03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
who's identified themselves as a member
 
03:54:29.110 --> 03:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
of osi um so that's a little
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
disappointing but
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
certainly i would like to hear from osi
 
03:54:34.630 --> 03:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
to understand where we can find a middle
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
path to move forward because i have the
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
city of concord counting on me to do
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
everything i can do to help my
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
municipality and i'm not the only person
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
who was elected to help their
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
municipality find a way to save money i
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
think we're in a really difficult
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
position where
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
following the pandemic
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities are scrambling to come up
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
with revenue streams and sources of
 
03:54:56.399 --> 03:54:57.750 align:start position:0%
with revenue streams and sources of
money

03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're really in a tough spot where we're
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
feeling the pinch financially and this
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
is the sort of bill that can really help
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of cities and towns across the
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
state so i'll leave it there but i
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
really think we need to look at this
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
from a global perspective and i do think
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
there is a middle road here
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vincent you
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
look like you have a bad case of cabin
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
fever and
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
need to uh vent a little bit
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
well you've known me from the past i'm
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
kind of like i like to move around a lot
 
03:55:28.150 --> 03:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
i don't like this let the grass grow or
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
moss grow underneath my feet however i
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment that um
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chairman thank you i
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to comment about uh taking
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
up plots of land for solar
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you have uh multi multi-uh
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
buildings multiplex buildings that are
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
owned by municipalities they're doing
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
rooftops also and they're also doing uh
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
like a pod that rotates with the sun
 
03:55:52.150 --> 03:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of new things that coming
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
out every single day
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
um and representative mcgee touched on
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
some things i'll just leave it at that i
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
just feel that
 
03:55:59.199 --> 03:56:00.950 align:start position:0%
just feel that
um

03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:02.229 --> 03:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know i feel that we should
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
really think about this uh this affects
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh on both sides it really does um and
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
 
03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:12.309 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
absolutely

03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%

03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh group membering but i had my
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of eyes opened up a lot last year
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
right after that bill we had 70 proposed
 
03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:25.990 align:start position:0%
right after that bill we had 70 proposed
um

03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
five megawatt projects in the state of
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire most on landfills whether
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
it was dairy
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh i could you know northumberland
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
whitefield just my district alone and
 
03:56:37.110 --> 03:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
these companies are in here to make
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
money at the end of the day because i'm
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm in the construction trades i
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
represented them and they ran hard they
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
unless we gave them that money they
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
weren't going to do it and no matter
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be sold at the retail
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
rate once you give somebody that money
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
the town's going to say oh
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
what uh chairman votes brought up is
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely awesome in acquisition you
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
know let it die but these towns are
 
03:57:01.110 --> 03:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to say no we need the money we
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
need the revenue and ultimately to fred
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
plett's point the ratepayers are going
 
03:57:08.550 --> 03:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
to pay it and it's a retail price i know
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
i pay
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
i buy my electricity independently right
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
at seven point
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
seven cents i get right now i mean
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
versus eighteen cents
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i mean we gotta you know once you
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
open up pandora's box we have to think
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
about this so there's a lot that goes
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
into this a lot more and dealing with
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
these companies because i am the head of
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
economic development for a while in
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
coahuas county
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is i mean when these companies
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
just ran but we voted down the bills
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
last year you know they had a 20 000
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
piano unit the guy was ready to roll out
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we were fumbling he just left
 
03:57:40.080 --> 03:57:41.590 align:start position:0%
and we were fumbling he just left
so

03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
no matter how we slice at the end of the
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
day and no town can afford this to start
 
03:57:45.279 --> 03:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
day and no town can afford this to start
out

03:57:46.070 --> 03:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know to
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
the chairman's point so i mean basically
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to subsidize these companies
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
to build them they make money i have one
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
company from nebraska another one from
 
03:57:55.680 --> 03:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
company from nebraska another one from
connecticut

03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh then i've been looking at all these
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
projects manchester
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
derry the ones that i was involved with
 
03:58:03.359 --> 03:58:04.229 align:start position:0%
derry the ones that i was involved with
so

03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is i mean it sounds great and
 
03:58:08.150 --> 03:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe me i agree it sounds great clean
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
energy and all that you know but 20 000
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
panels i mean
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's the average one of these projects
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
so we got to think about it because it
 
03:58:19.510 --> 03:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
once we start the subsidy we can't go
 
03:58:19.520 --> 03:58:20.710 align:start position:0%
once we start the subsidy we can't go
back

03:58:20.710 --> 03:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
you guys know it's a pilot program well
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to say well my town just
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
invested a million dollars we can't stop
 
03:58:28.469 --> 03:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
it it's just like these thermals that i
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't want ended but we have many
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
projects that i wrote grants on for
 
03:58:32.479 --> 03:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
projects that i wrote grants on for
thermals

03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
thermals
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're into these projects now so
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
what's the number one argument we've had
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
on 213 was that we had all these people
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
have all this money invested in it we
 
03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
can't take them back
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i agree with that so if we give them
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
these now at these rates we can't take
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
them back
 
03:58:51.990 --> 03:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
good points uh representative pimentel
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%

mark sanborn i'm the new energy advisor
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the office of osi so i just wanted
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the representatives know
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh we are um following the hearing and
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
we are listening in um i can tell you
 
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
that um as of right now we will not be
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
weighing in
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
on either this bill or any of the other
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
bills currently in committee in either
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
chamber as already noted there's a bill
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
in the senate that is um has been
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
offered and so we're going to hold
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
judgment on any of the bills
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
until there's final passage they come
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
out of committee um and we see what the
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
legislature is moving forward with um so
 
04:00:07.590 --> 04:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're following we're listening um we're
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
taking notes but
 
04:00:11.189 --> 04:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
we won't be weighing in
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
until um
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate you uh
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
introducing yourself and congratulations
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.830 --> 04:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
representatives well i have a couple and
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
seeing that i don't know if mark mr
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
sanborn is still on but i wonder if he's
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
not weighing in
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
does he have any pertinent information
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee should have
 
04:00:46.960 --> 04:00:48.229 align:start position:0%
that the committee should have
um

04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:50.790 --> 04:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility you can give
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
information and facts without
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
weighing in on a bill
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to comment on that request
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
no i mean i don't think our office has
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
any additional information
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
um you know at this point i know this
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
has been debated heavily in the last
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions even though that was
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
before i arrived in this position and so
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
no we we have no information to add um
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
we'll wait to see what you guys um
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
what the legislature moves forward with
 
04:01:26.469 --> 04:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
um before deciding if it's within the
 
04:01:30.150 --> 04:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
governor's policy agenda or not
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay i i'd like to just follow up with
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh chairman votes
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
what chairman votes's proposal
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
may i
 
04:01:38.479 --> 04:01:41.590 align:start position:0%
may i
yes

04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
as i suspected that this would then hold
 
04:01:47.189 --> 04:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
this up for for quite a while and that's
 
04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing the holding this bill
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
up whether we whatever we do with it
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to get held up because it's
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to get held up whether we want to
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
do it or whether we don't want to do it
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
or wouldn't it likes it or the governor
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
likes it to your point
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman votes about
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh putting uh a time limit on it i think
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
if we did that i wouldn't be objections
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
to say once you've recouped
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
your capital fees and you're not paying
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
anything which will take
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 years
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
and you go into that
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
that project with your eyes wide open
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
and knowing that that's going to be the
 
04:02:29.680 --> 04:02:30.710 align:start position:0%
and knowing that that's going to be the
case

04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't see a problem with that we
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
have done that with uh
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
electric companies
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
matter of fact and then they're they're
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're done by the puc but we have a
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
certain little hitch on there that's
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
called stranded costs which means
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be on the hook for
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
anything well we're not offering these
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
people stranded costs we're offering
 
04:02:50.640 --> 04:02:52.309 align:start position:0%
people stranded costs we're offering
them

04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
to recoup their capital costs
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
and then that's the end of it
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that to me
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
is not unreasonable
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
so i myself would not
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
think that if something like that could
 
04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
move this bill
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
along it wouldn't be harmful as long as
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
the parties know what the agreement is
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
i hate to say it but it might actually
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
be preferable
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
because it would be at least
 
04:03:29.600 --> 04:03:30.389 align:start position:0%
because it would be at least
if

04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
other you know future legislators didn't
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
throw it up and down it would be really
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
helpful for people who are doing
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
planning to understand what the deal is
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
and what you know that they would
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh receive some incentive to be able to
 
04:03:45.760 --> 04:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
uh receive some incentive to be able to
um

04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
switch their chemical plant over so that
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
they had some local sustainable energy
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know i know i got information
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
from my energy committee um
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
with some of the bills that we had this
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
time i asked them
 
04:04:04.469 --> 04:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
what we had um saved as a result of the
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
investments that we've made in the
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
conversions that we've made over time
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
and the panels on our schools and that
 
04:04:12.150 --> 04:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and it's over a hundred
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year i mean we're
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
saving a lot of money because of these
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
investments so
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
to your point that there are towns that
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to invest that is
 
04:04:21.199 --> 04:04:22.070 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to invest that is
true

04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
but if you have net metering
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
more municipalities will consider the
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
idea of lowering their overall cost by
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
making some investments and they can
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
make them over time
 
04:04:35.429 --> 04:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
but if they understand that
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
the state will help them with those um
 
04:04:40.389 --> 04:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
upfront costs
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
and recouping their capital investment i
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
think that that that sounds like a very
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable policy to me
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
so um i just think we should do
 
04:04:52.150 --> 04:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
something on it because the idea that
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
nothing needs to be done is
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
it just really feels like we're
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry more editorializing i'm sorry
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitching still
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
have your hand up oh okay i forgot to
 
04:05:16.150 --> 04:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay um representative nick williams are
 
04:05:19.690 --> 04:05:19.700 align:start position:0%
you still here
 
04:05:19.700 --> 04:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
you still here
[Music]

04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
no it's actually left
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm here i'm here
 
04:05:28.150 --> 04:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me would you like to
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
discord discuss uh your amendment
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
give us your rationale for your
 
04:05:32.720 --> 04:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
give us your rationale for your
amendment

04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
i think my amendment is the long shot um
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
because it's the five megawatts instead
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the three that we were talking about
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
as a compromise so um
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
the the changes between the original
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill and my amendment are simply
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
changing uh keeping the five megawatt
 
04:05:53.189 --> 04:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
and also allowing um communities to
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
share across borders so it's not just
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
limited to one municipality
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
those are the two big things that i
 
04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
think would make a difference
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
if we were serious about moving forward
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the big number um but from the
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
discussion i've heard thus far it sounds
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
as though five megawatts is probably far
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of reasonable
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
compromise and so i don't believe that
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is a realistic amendment and i'm
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to say it's simply here for
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
discussion um it's probably not the one
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
we've moved forward with but here we are
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
can you say more about the other piece
 
04:06:22.720 --> 04:06:24.830 align:start position:0%
can you say more about the other piece
though

04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
about municipalities yeah
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
because i think that's an important
 
04:06:30.150 --> 04:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
piece that
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
the other the others don't have the
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
other amendments don't have
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
pull it up so i'm looking at the same
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
thing as everyone else
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it allows i think it's allowing
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
county um
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
so a municipal host could be owned by
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
either public or private entity
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at uh
 
04:07:06.800 --> 04:07:09.349 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at uh
line

04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
so this allows
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
here we go if the facility began
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
operation after january 1 2020 a
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
municipal host shall be located in the
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
same municipality as all group members
 
04:07:28.239 --> 04:07:29.189 align:start position:0%
same municipality as all group members
or

04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
serve group members located in
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
contiguous municipalities so an example
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
here would be um if
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
i we're we're looking at some solar in
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
my community of concord
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
um it's right on the concord bow line
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
so there is some potential for concord
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
and bow to do sharing if they determined
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
that it made sense
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
um so this would allow that because
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
they're contiguous right they're
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
touching one another
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
so that that opens up um i think more
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
potential for sharing resources
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that's probably
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
more reasonable from a long-term
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
perspective because you may have small
 
04:08:08.560 --> 04:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
perspective because you may have small
towns

04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
that have the ability to share between
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
two towns for a hydro facility but a
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
single hydro may be too much for just
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mick
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
williams i have a question for you about
 
04:08:25.920 --> 04:08:27.429 align:start position:0%
williams i have a question for you about
that

04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
this he has a fairly
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
extensive experience with
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
towns and to share
 
04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:36.389 align:start position:0%
towns and to share
school

04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:08:36.399 --> 04:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
school
and

04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:40.150 --> 04:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works but in a lot of cases
 
04:08:40.160 --> 04:08:41.269 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works but in a lot of cases
there's

04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
controversy and there's ugly breakups
 
04:08:43.920 --> 04:08:44.710 align:start position:0%
controversy and there's ugly breakups
when

04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
towns decide to
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
that they can no longer work together on
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
a single school
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
you fear the same thing could happen
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.520 --> 04:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
host

04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
host
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
groups if they were shared amongst towns
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's a great question chair bows i'm
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
glad you bring that up
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
the the interesting thing is we do have
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
um a history of breakups right in the
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire we've had towns
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
come together for schools and then break
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
up over it and determine how to allocate
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
funds after the fact so we have some
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
precedent for divorce
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
um certainly i wouldn't want that to
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
happen but it's a potential that it
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
could happen and we have precedent to
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
look to and
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
make similar decisions
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
following an energy breakup between two
 
04:09:35.110 --> 04:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
or more municipalities that may have
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
been pooling resources
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think that there was a really good
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
discussion a little bit earlier about
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
bonding a project and how that would
 
04:09:42.720 --> 04:09:43.429 align:start position:0%
bonding a project and how that would
look

04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
how the paperwork would be structured
 
04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
for coming up with financing to actually
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
do the initial install
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
so i would say you would probably look
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
to the paperwork on the bonding to
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
determine who's on the hook and at what
 
04:09:55.279 --> 04:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
determine who's on the hook and at what
percentages

04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
and that's how it would be handled just
 
04:09:58.479 --> 04:09:59.349 align:start position:0%
and that's how it would be handled just
like

04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
a actually just like a divorce if we're
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
looking at dividing assets between
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
spouses when they divorce
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's the same
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
situation where we look to the contract
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
and look to what was agreed upon look to
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
who was contributing what and who was
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking what from the relationship in
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
order to do an amicable divorce
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't see this as being new or
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
novel um we certainly have precedent for
 
04:10:23.359 --> 04:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
novel um we certainly have precedent for
breakups

04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
breakups
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
but in the same hand i think that there
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
are projects here in new hampshire that
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
could not possibly happen without
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
contributing municipalities having
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
multiple towns come together in order to
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation you may
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
recall that we spent quite a bit of time
 
04:10:47.110 --> 04:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the hb 315 amendment
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh specifying what would happen if
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
someone opted out of an aggregation and
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
went back to the vault service for
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
was on default service and wanted to opt
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
into the aggregation
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
and who was responsible for what so it
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
can be complicated and required
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
rule making in order to make it happen
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee can comment on this
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
possibly when i lived in hollis i lived
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
there for 15 years and it seemed like
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
every town meeting there was something
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
that had to do with a disagreement
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
between hollis and brookline over the
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
allocation of costs for their combined i
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
just want you to know that i actually am
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
sponsoring and speaking on a bill in
 
04:11:36.150 --> 04:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
front of education tomorrow on
 
04:11:36.160 --> 04:11:38.950 align:start position:0%
front of education tomorrow on
apportionment

04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it has not changed i can tell you
 
04:11:41.520 --> 04:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
so it has not changed i can tell you
that

04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
all right who uh who else wants to speak
 
04:11:52.150 --> 04:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative williams version of the
 
04:11:58.229 --> 04:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything further to say on
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
this subject i think we've explored it
 
04:12:04.150 --> 04:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
quite uh
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
thoroughly in the hour and 15 minutes
 
04:12:10.150 --> 04:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
one more thing
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.189 --> 04:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
you have cheers else you'd like to add
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
oh representative bernardi actually has
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
something to eat like this so yes just
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.110 --> 04:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to hydro power i think
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
because these are existing
 
04:12:32.640 --> 04:12:33.990 align:start position:0%
because these are existing
infrastructure

04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
been there a long time there's there's a
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
potential for utility for uh
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities take advantage of those
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i uh and it's a small defined
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
in place installments that would be
 
04:12:54.150 --> 04:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for that
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
i could
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
agree to expand net metering
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
for those kinds of facilities but for
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
solar or wind power i think that one
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
megawatt limit is perfectly legitimate
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
refer to the representative werner said
 
04:13:12.399 --> 04:13:13.830 align:start position:0%
refer to the representative werner said
uh

04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing is passing
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
costs on to late payers in a
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
undefined exploding rate and i'm not
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
signing up for that
 
04:13:23.920 --> 04:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
signing up for that
situation

04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now uh representative
 
04:13:31.110 --> 04:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
mcgee you have something else to add
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it might be moot at this
 
04:13:35.429 --> 04:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
point but i guess
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
my only
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
parting thought would be
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
if we have any consensus around what it
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
is we were trying to accomplish with
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill keeps coming back again and
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
again and again i understand um
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative brazhini
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
thinks hydro is the only legitimate you
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
know recipient of of net metering
 
04:13:59.110 --> 04:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're yeah that's that's
 
04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
not what the bill is right the bill is
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
is broader than that but it is just
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities so
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
are we trying to do a pilot are we
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
trying to solve something for
 
04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities are we you know i i wish
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
we just knew what our objective was
 
04:14:15.600 --> 04:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
we just knew what our objective was
because

04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
without understanding what it is
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
we may or may not be trying to solve
 
04:14:21.760 --> 04:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
we may or may not be trying to solve
we

04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're really just uh
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
all making individual points that don't
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
really lead to anything and i it's a
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
concern of mine because
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
i thought we had heard enough bills even
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the last you know we've been hearing
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
them for a long time all trying to do
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
this one is more limited than most
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
but it's not just hydro because that's
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
not what people are asking us for
 
04:14:47.520 --> 04:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
not what people are asking us for
so

04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:48.560 --> 04:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
i i just wonder if
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
if we're ever going to have any
 
04:14:55.110 --> 04:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
discussion as a committee about what
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
goals we have around net metering
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
if there are any goals that we're trying
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
well none metering all
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative flint yeah how about not
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
i know that representative mcgee is goal
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
oriented because that's what businesses
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
do and very often they take their goals
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
and throw them in the toilet but i think
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
that what we're trying to do here
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
is encourage
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
alternative sources of power
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and utilize the resources some of
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
which we have and some of summers which
 
04:15:48.389 --> 04:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
we need to take advantage of such as
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
hydro that we're not taking full
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of such as the sun which god
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
has given us i think we have to
 
04:15:55.279 --> 04:15:56.710 align:start position:0%
has given us i think we have to
uh

04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do we're
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage that use
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to give incentives
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
which are given every day
 
04:16:07.110 --> 04:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
in every way
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know even the federal government now
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
has given us incentives and
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
we have to do
 
04:16:16.399 --> 04:16:17.510 align:start position:0%
we have to do
something

04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
to help new hampshire
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
recover and bringing down electric rates
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
is one of them and i think that this can
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
bring down
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
electric rates and i think that
 
04:16:31.110 --> 04:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know representative vos had a very
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
good idea i think that there are other
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
ideas here that you know maybe
 
04:16:35.760 --> 04:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
ideas here that you know maybe
contiguous

04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities can go into it with each
 
04:16:39.120 --> 04:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
communities can go into it with each
other

04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
even if they fist fight a little bit
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
we need to do that
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
and to say
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
nearly just blanketly
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
we don't subsidize anything it's totally
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
a false statement i can't name one area
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
of life that is not subsidized in this
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
state in one way or another we just
 
04:17:06.110 --> 04:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
voted i do believe to exempt
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities from
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
paying certain fees well what's that if
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a subsidy to win a municipality
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
because if those fees aren't paid they
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
got to be collected someplace else so i
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
think we need to really look at what
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing we can put a time limit on
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
it we can put the cap on it we can have
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
we can order a review we can tell the pc
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
review it not for 20 years give us a
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
report and a review
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
in in 24 months
 
04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
we can do all those things
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
but if we're just plain not willing to
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
entertain the idea of net metering
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
i wonder if somebody's going to put a
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill in
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
net metering from the individuals who
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
have it now
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's just as backwards
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to move forwards and
 
04:18:00.080 --> 04:18:02.309 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to move forwards and
not

04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
we need more discussion on it i think
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's some very good ideas i think
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a new amendment could be
 
04:18:08.319 --> 04:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a new amendment could be
crafted

04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
crafted
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
but if the whole
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
enchilada is we just don't want a period
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
plain simple end it and end it and for
 
04:18:16.000 --> 04:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
plain simple end it and end it and for
everybody

04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
end it for everybody but nobody will do
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
that because that will hurt everybody's
 
04:18:22.560 --> 04:18:24.070 align:start position:0%
that because that will hurt everybody's
constituents

04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
and everybody's constituent will
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
rise up
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
if you really believe it's a subsidy do
 
04:18:33.429 --> 04:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
you believe that i should subsidize my
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
neighbor because they have a solar panel
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
and at this end
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
but that won't happen so let's move
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
forward with a system we already have in
 
04:18:42.159 --> 04:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
forward with a system we already have in
place

04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and help municipalities and everybody in
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
that municipality to advantage and and
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
be helped by lower rates
 
04:18:51.439 --> 04:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
be helped by lower rates
and

04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:52.640 --> 04:18:54.550 align:start position:0%
and
probably

04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen but i would
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
love to see us get another amendment
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
crafted and get some of the stakeholders
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
involved here
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think one of the goals of our
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee i believe should really be to
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
try to have
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
energy independence for our state
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that starts with looking at the
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
sources of energy that we can generate
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
in our own state and trying to keep a
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
diverse energy mix
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh that helps us locally
 
04:19:34.479 --> 04:19:35.349 align:start position:0%
uh that helps us locally
and

04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
incidentally if we do nothing if we
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
decide we're gonna pass on all these
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
efforts whether it's
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency renewable energy net
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
metering all this stuff
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't think for one minute that that's
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
going to push down electric rates for
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
rate consistency it is going to do the
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
opposite everyone around us is pushing
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
down their demand therefore our
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
transmission costs will be going up
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
every year and your constituents
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
bills for electricity will be going up
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
every year so if you do nothing you are
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually pushing up electric bills for
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
everybody in this state that is the
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
option and we can say we don't like this
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
or that but that is going to be the
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.000 --> 04:20:23.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
since you raise a an interesting point
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts our next door neighbor has
 
04:20:29.760 --> 04:20:31.910 align:start position:0%
massachusetts our next door neighbor has
spent

04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
spent
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
far more than we have on
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy on energy efficiency
 
04:20:40.229 --> 04:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
and yet massachusetts has higher
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
electric rates than even california
 
04:20:44.319 --> 04:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
electric rates than even california
uh

04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:45.600 --> 04:20:47.189 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you think
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
what makes you think
 
04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
that um greater investments in renewable
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
energy and energy efficiency are
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
actually going to lower costs when that
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't been the case in massachusetts
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman first of all
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
you you and i both know that as many
 
04:21:08.309 --> 04:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
people have expressed we are in a
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
transition we're in a transition from
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel dependency into a new era
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
which hasn't fully arrived yet and many
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
states are betting that that new
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
a new energy sources the renewable
 
04:21:24.149 --> 04:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
energy sources are going to be the
 
04:21:24.159 --> 04:21:25.269 align:start position:0%
energy sources are going to be the
future

04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that requires upfront costs
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
and that upfront cost as you mentioned
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the solar projects is pretty high
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
but but you also have to remember that
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
many of these renewable energy projects
 
04:21:41.910 --> 04:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
the fuel costs are zero they're not
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
volatile they don't go up and down they
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
are zero once you install these
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
facilities solar wind
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
other projects
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
fuel costs will be contained in fact
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
they are contained at zero cost
 
04:21:56.000 --> 04:21:56.870 align:start position:0%
they are contained at zero cost
so

04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it is also true as we we all know
 
04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
but it is also true as we we all know
that

04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
the transmission expenses for new
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire have been going up for the
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
last five or six years now whereas other
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
states around us their transmission
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
costs have been going down or as staying
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
flat that will continue to go up uh if
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
we don't do something that's true
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
and uh on the other hand many of these
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
other states around us the reason they
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
have more expensive
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
bills and maybe even rates is because
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
they are offering so many services to
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
their residents you know that that rate
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
that they paid down there that includes
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
free energy efficiency devices like
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
thermostats and light bulbs they get
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
that for free they don't get that for
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
free here in new hampshire because we're
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
a cheap skate state we we think we don't
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
want to spend any money now but what
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
you're doing is you're cutting off
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
investment for the future so okay if
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to do we're cutting
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
off opportunities for the future by
 
04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
saving a little money right now that's
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening and uh i think that's
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
the reason we need to take action
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative platt mr chairman where
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
are we calling i've been sitting here
 
04:23:13.520 --> 04:23:14.389 align:start position:0%
are we calling i've been sitting here
for

04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
we would not advance one moment in any
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
direction so i'd like to
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
see if we can control this
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
time to do that i think we
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
have had a good discussion on this issue
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't sense that we're going to
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
achieve any kind of consensus today
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
i will hold on to this bill hb 106 for
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
the next week or so
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
before turning it over to the clerk
 
04:23:47.680 --> 04:23:50.389 align:start position:0%
before turning it over to the clerk
to

04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.399 --> 04:23:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
allow

04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
us to think about this and see if we can
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
come up with uh see if anybody comes up
 
04:23:57.279 --> 04:23:57.990 align:start position:0%
come up with uh see if anybody comes up
with

04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
a bright idea that can allow us to move
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
04:24:01.600 --> 04:24:02.790 align:start position:0%
this forward
um

04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:02.800 --> 04:24:03.670 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
as long as i hold on to the bill we can
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
still reconsider our motion to retain so
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
i will hold on to it for a week and
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
we'll see where we go from there
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
partial do you have a comment
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
i'm an exactly uh uh sherman vos i just
 
04:24:22.149 --> 04:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank you for allowing this
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
discussion today
 
04:24:25.110 --> 04:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's to all of our benefit
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
examining these issues and
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
i truly appreciate it
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
very welcome
 
04:24:31.439 --> 04:24:33.110 align:start position:0%
very welcome
um

04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative man did you have
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
something did you have your hand out
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
i did but i changed my mind i thought
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
the last comment was just fine sausage
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you i'd like to thank you
 
04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman for doing
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
make giving us this opportunity
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to have a clarification
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to want to reconsider this
 
04:24:53.920 --> 04:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
if we were to want to reconsider this
bill

04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can't do it unless we have a formal
 
04:24:56.880 --> 04:24:58.469 align:start position:0%
we can't do it unless we have a formal
meeting

04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
you just can't have it sitting around
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
and say hey maybe somebody wants to
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
reconsider it unless we have an
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reconsider it uh it's
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
not a viable option
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
maybe i
 
04:25:12.560 --> 04:25:13.429 align:start position:0%
maybe i
wasn't

04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
maybe i mis
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
misstated what i meant to say maybe i
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say it elegantly enough what i
 
04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
meant was
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'll hold on to this bill for a week
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if somebody comes up with a
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
that i think could allow us to come to a
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
consensus on this bill
 
04:25:36.309 --> 04:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
let me know and what i will do is i will
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
arrange for us to have another meeting
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
it will have to be
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
a work session i suppose
 
04:25:42.560 --> 04:25:44.309 align:start position:0%
a work session i suppose
uh

04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
and i think a work session
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
may not have to be noticed for seven
 
04:25:51.670 --> 04:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
days i think we may only have to notice
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
a work session for 24 days 24 hours so
 
04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
we can probably get a meeting set up
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly of course that assumes
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we can find a room and a zoom
 
04:26:01.279 --> 04:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
that we can find a room and a zoom
license

04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
that's free but and that's always
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
problematic but
 
04:26:07.680 --> 04:26:09.670 align:start position:0%
problematic but
okay

04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
anybody comes up with a brilliant idea
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
04:26:12.640 --> 04:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
let me know
[Music]

04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman okay
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative brasman thank you i
 
04:26:21.269 --> 04:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
was just gonna add that we can also do a
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
straw poll over email if we need to
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
figure out if we want to
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
do anything further or not
 
04:26:29.910 --> 04:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative resny suggested we
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'll have to think about that because it
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
might be a right to know violation
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to use email for
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
full committee discussions of things
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
because it could be a right-to-know
 
04:26:47.349 --> 04:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
violation but i'll i'll look into that
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.110 --> 04:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts oh i was
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
just going to say i don't think we can
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
do that by email
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
i think we have to do that in public so
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
and you already came up with that so i
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
and you know if we if we have a meeting
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
we decide hey we're just gonna go with
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
the you can take five minutes out of
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
your schedule to just do that by zone
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
i have one more thing that i'd like to
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
say to all of you before we leave there
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
was an excellent article in the
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
manchester union leader
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
on sunday about zoom fatigue
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
i saw it
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
fatigue is a real thing it's been
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
studied by researchers at stanford
 
04:27:29.279 --> 04:27:30.630 align:start position:0%
studied by researchers at stanford
university

04:27:30.630 --> 04:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
university
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and what they have discovered is that
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you do too much zoom
 
04:27:35.840 --> 04:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
if you do too much zoom
it

04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
has a negative impact on you and they
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually have a list of tips
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
of things you can do during zoom
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
meetings to reduce your zoom fatigue and
 
04:27:48.309 --> 04:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
one of the tips is to turn your video
 
04:27:48.319 --> 04:27:49.189 align:start position:0%
one of the tips is to turn your video
off

04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:27:49.199 --> 04:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
off
so

04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
and leave it for some period of time
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
because part of what creates zoom
 
04:27:57.910 --> 04:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
fatigue is the idea that other people
 
04:27:59.400 --> 04:27:59.410 align:start position:0%
are looking at you all the time
 
04:27:59.410 --> 04:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
are looking at you all the time
[Laughter]

04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:28:02.800 --> 04:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
so

04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
well in my case it's me having to look
 
04:28:07.110 --> 04:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
at myself
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:28:09.439 --> 04:28:10.229 align:start position:0%
that's it
so

04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%

04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%

04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
website and search for that article on
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
