00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
I don't know if this is recorded.

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.000
So I think I put everything that was asked for in the thing in there.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I have asked my caucus, and everybody is totally cool with this.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think we could go consent.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I did screw one thing up on here.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.500
I forgot to put the effective date.

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
Oh, okay.

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Okay, and so that I really did want to ask you guys.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.500
I'm in a town council form of government, so we're able to react faster.

20
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.500
You guys are all, I think a lot of you are SB2.

21
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.500
What do you guys, what do you want?

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:27.500
I would say from my perspective, I think the original effective date of 60 days is fine with this type of legislation because the town has to adopt it irregardless.

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.500
So for them to update they'll still have the opportunity.

24
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
This becomes law.

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.000
This will give them some time to educate everybody prior to that portion of it being updated.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
But one way or the other it goes through.

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
You know, that's me.

28
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't have a problem.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.500
I mean, I usually come up on a warrant out of the plan.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
I don't have a problem.

31
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I mean, I think usually all of us come up on a warrant out of the front line, so they may still do that.

32
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I don't know.

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.500
I mean, I'm going to â€“ so I'm totally fine with that, honestly.

34
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.500
So it would be 60 days from this.

35
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
All right, so here's the question.

36
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:38.000
I do need to put this back into OLS, but is everybody fine with this language with 60 days?

37
00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:58.500
I'm good i'm good my my only comment about the existing language was um 51 of the properties are in a thousand i have it on but it's not picking up my voice um 51 of the properties went in a thousand foot radius and then built before the effective date of this section that requires keeping track of the effective date when all the properties were built i mean i would be okay with just within a thousand foot radius period and then you'll have to keep track of all that extra stuff the only reason we did that this will do creep and i think that met resistance if we do it with this language it would be unanimous i don I don't think it's not going to be that hard because you're going to have to go do the research anyway, so it's going to come up, so it's not that big a thing, but it stops creep.

38
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.500
And again, I think that it will be totally unanimous.

39
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500
It'll go through consent.

40
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
Fair enough.

41
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
Okay.

42
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500
Line 13.

43
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
Are we good?

44
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:25.000
So I will say I'll lead with you or I'll go with what you think is best to get it to put forward.

45
00:04:25.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I do think that there may be a time coming forward where you you want to take that out only because if the towns continue to implement zoning the way they were which is what this is intended to fix then i think it'll have there'll be some negative effects from it but i think overall this is a huge improvement yeah i think we're going to come back to this honestly we didn't do that patterns the zoning we didn't get.

46
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.500
And I think for us, we should strongly consider bipartisanly working on that and adding, exactly adding to this.

47
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.500
I think this is just the first step.

48
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
It's going to give relief, but we can do better.

49
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Yeah.

50
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.500
Okay.

51
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500
Agreed.

52
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
All right.

53
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.000
If that's the case, it's unanimous and we're done.

54
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I'll write this up.

55
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I'll submit this to OLS, and I think we got something finished.

56
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Should we formally just make sure because we haven't heard from everyone, everybody like raise your hands if you agree.

57
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I should probably do you know a roll call vote.

58
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Representative Gibbs.

59
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
No.

60
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
today no we'll say i did Thank you.

61
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Yeah, we are going to add the effective date to that, so that doesn't have the effective date on there.

62
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.500
Well, we're done with that.

63
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
Yeah.

64
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.000
Well, the Republicans are having a caucus in here at 930.

Thank you.

126
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Thank you.

127
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Thank you.

128
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Thank you.

129
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Thank you.

130
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Thank you.

131
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Thank you.

132
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Thank you.

133
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Thank you.

134
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Thank you.

135
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Thank you.

136
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Thank you.

137
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:07.500
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one mission, among God, indisible, with liberty and justice for all.

138
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay, so today we have one bill that I've noticed for an exec.

139
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That's an early bill.

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.500
We will absolutely get that out of committee today.

141
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:47.500
And the rest of them, there's a list of them that I'd like to take care of today in conferring with the ranking member, trying to get some of these bills on the calendar so that we do not have a lot of debates at the end of March when the calendar fills up.

142
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.000
So hopefully we can get through a bunch of these today.

143
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So the first thing is I'm going to open up the exec session on HB 572, and I'll recognize Representative Page for a motion.

144
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I would move on to pass.

145
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Okay.

146
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Is there a second?

147
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I'll second it.

148
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.500
Or Representative Kerwin, did you want to second it?

149
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
Oh, sure.

150
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.500
All right.

151
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.500
Representative Kerwin will second.

152
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.000
And then I would like to offer Amendment 0560H.

153
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.500
Representative Kerwin, you second that?

154
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500
Okay.

155
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.500
So the motion by Representative Page ought to pass with Amendment No.

156
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.000
0560H, seconded by Representative Kerwin.

157
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Would you like to speak to the motion?

158
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Sure, yes.

159
00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I think everybody agrees that this proposed program can contribute a lot to our efforts to increase our housing supply here in the state of new hampshire i think recognizing that this is the challenging budget environment uh that it is that this is probably the version of this bill that we can get passed this year which is to get the program up and off the ground but to keep that appropriation manageable in this particular budget environment representative you also um you're so I had sat down with the sponsor of this and indicated that the appropriation of ten and a half million dollars for housing champion probably is not in the cards so to speak for well I can't predict what house finance is gonna do but I have a better around long enough to to know.

160
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So what we did is we took out the Housing Champion Grant Fund Program designation, and we maintained one appropriation of $150,000 to create a municipal â€“ establishing a compilation of municipal and county-owned property determined appropriate for residential development by the select board.

161
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:35.500
So that's going to hopefully get a database together that, you know, when people are looking for residential development properties, hopefully the towns will opt in and give us this information.

162
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.500
Additionally, it gives some new power to review site plans.

163
00:12:40.500 --> 00:13:15.500
um this is an enabling legislation so it allows um if the local legislative body of the municipality um has authorized it um it authorizes a bypass of the minor site plan review um so hopefully that will help speed up the approval process in some ways so um i like represent page said there there were some merits to this bill I just was concerned primarily about the appropriation.

164
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.000
That's no longer in it.

165
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.500
There's a much smaller appropriation in there.

166
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:30.500
So this will go off to finance, but at least it will get our endorsement before it does.

167
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.500
Any other comments?

168
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.500
All right.

169
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.500
Is show of hands on the amendment okay?

170
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500
All right.

171
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500
Oh, I haven't called it yet.

172
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.500
All right.

173
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.000
All those in favor of adopting amendment number 2025-0560H, raise your hand now.

174
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Those opposed.

175
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Abstentions?

176
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
No abstentions.

177
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.500
Sorry, I'm thinking I'm on the local budget committee.

178
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500
That passes unanimous.

179
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.500
All right.

180
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.000
So we're on the motion of ought to pass as amended.

181
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Is there any comments on that?

182
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Seeing none, I'll call the roll.

183
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Vice Chairman Cole?

184
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yes.

185
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Representative Thaxton?

186
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yes.

187
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Representative Aaron?

188
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Yes.

189
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Representative Bollier?

190
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yes.

191
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Representative Dumont?

192
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Yes.

193
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Representative Grant?

194
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Yes.

195
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Representative Miles, not Yes.

196
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Representative Grant?

197
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Yes.

198
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Representative Miles?

199
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Not here.

200
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Representative Miner?

201
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Yes.

202
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Clerk Reinfert?

203
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Yes.

204
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Representative Page?

205
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Yes.

206
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Representative Boras?

207
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
As Representative Seibert?

208
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Yep.

209
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.500
Okay, so do I say both names or just?

210
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.500
No, just our name.

211
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.500
Okay.

212
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.500
Representative Seibert?

213
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.500
Yes.

214
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500
just our name.

215
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.500
Okay.

216
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500
Representative Seibert.

217
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.500
Yes.

218
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500
Representative Reed, not here.

219
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.500
Representative Gibbs.

220
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.500
Yes.

221
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.500
Representative Hicks.

222
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.500
Yes.

223
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500
Representative Howland.

224
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
Yes.

225
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
Representative Hagner.

226
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
Yes.

227
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
Representative Kerwin.

228
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.500
Yes.

229
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.500
And Chairman Alexander.

230
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Yes.

231
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.000
Motion carries 16 to 0.

232
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Representative Page, will you write the majority report?

233
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Good pleasure.

234
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
All right.

235
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And any objection?

236
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.500
This might be on the regular calendar.

237
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.500
I have to check with the fiscal note.

238
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.500
It probably will be on the regular calendar.

239
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.500
Cannot call and consent because of the appropriation.

240
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.500
There's $150,000 appropriation.

241
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.500
All right.

242
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.000
So that will probably go on the regular calendar.

243
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
All right.

244
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.500
Next up, I want to have a conversation on HB 296.

245
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:58.000
I don't think we're ready for a vote on it, but I at least want to recognize Representative Dumont to speak to an amendment that you had drafted and some of the conversations around that.

246
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So I passed around an amendment.

247
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
It's pretty straightforward.

248
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It just basically says that, you know, private roads built to town standards shall be treated the same way as laws that are on town roads.

249
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.500
The only thing that I'd like to add in there on line seven after the word private roads is or class six roads.

250
00:17:27.500 --> 00:18:02.500
That way it's basically, you know, existing roadways that aren't maintained by a town and or private roadways that are built to the town standards are treated the same way as ones with frontage on uh on regular town roads other discussion on that is everybody okay with with that amendment when that's drafted all right represent howlin i was I was just going to say, I think it's good.

251
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:14.500
I mean, our one concern really was that please don't build, like, private roads that are, like, substandard out there and go a stretch.

252
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:21.000
We really want the new ones to be more conforming, like you said.

253
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.500
It'll solve so many problems.

254
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.500
I think this is a really good change.

255
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500
Great.

256
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.000
Okay, so I'm not going to call the exec.

257
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We're going to get an amendment drafted, and hopefully we can do something really quick in a couple weeks and take care of that.

258
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Okay, next up, I want to open up the executive session on HB 342 and recognize Representative Howland.

259
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I guess that's me.

260
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
They are.

261
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Wow.

262
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
All right.

263
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
So I'm digging through my papers.

264
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
We just did this this morning.

265
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.500
So this one, in the past, what this was going to do is.

266
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.500
I would make a motion first.

267
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.000
I would like to make a motion to pass.

268
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Where's my.

269
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Through all these papers.

270
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I know I haven't.

271
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Yes.

272
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
0579H.

273
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
That's page.

274
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
All right.

275
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.500
So I'd like to make a motion to pass the amendment for House Bill 342.

276
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.500
So your motion would be ought to pass?

277
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
Ought to pass.

278
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.500
And then you're going to move an amendment.

279
00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.500
And then I would like to move the amendment, which is House Bill 342-0579H.

280
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.500
I second the ought to pass.

281
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500
All right.

282
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.000
So Representative Page seconds your ought to pass motion.

283
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.500
Representative Howland offers amendment 0579H.

284
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.000
And I second the amendment.

285
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.500
And Representative Reid seconds that.

286
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.500
Representative Howland, would you like to speak to your amendment?

287
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.000
All right, let me pull it out.

288
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
All right.

289
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.500
I'm sorry for the confusion.

290
00:20:31.500 --> 00:21:10.000
So we met, and when we went over it, initially what this was going to do is if you threw out a 1,000-foot buffer, that anything within that, you did within your thousand foot buffer, that anything within that you did within your thousand foot buffer, if you could show that the lot size that you wanted to do conformed with what was in that thousand foot buffer, initially it was 90%, then you could do it.

291
00:21:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
you would be issued a variance and then the planning board would look at your density report and see if it was okay and let you build it and so uh the changes that we made on it um i still don't have my like right sheet so what we said we didn't want it so that you were bypassing the um the zba and so instead what we said is you could do the thousand foot uh buffer uh you were able to use a majority rather than 90 percent of the properties within that thousand foot buffer and we said that they would be you it would only be properties that had been built before this uh had been in place so we didn't want zones to keep creeping indefinitely.

292
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.500
If you did that, you would go to your town administrator.

293
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:34.000
The town administrator would verify that you actually met the lot coverage of 51% in that buffer, and they would issue you a building permit.

294
00:22:34.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So it would expedite the building permit it would allow your property to conform to what is in that thousand foot buffer and uh we thought that it's a good infill bill so it really simplified stuff and then the effective date of it is 60 days do you have an the amendment um i i have the amendment in I have the amendment in my...

295
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Does the committee have copies of the amendment?

296
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I gave it to the committee.

297
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Everybody in the committee had copies.

298
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Oh, okay.

299
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I've got to get organized then.

300
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Other comments on this?

301
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
No, it's okay.

302
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.500
I probably have a copy of you.

303
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.500
Thank you.

304
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.500
Okay, other comments?

305
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:40.000
Representative Bolio or Dumont or Grant, you were all part of the subcommittee.

306
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Representative Dumont.

307
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.500
Yeah, I think that this worked out really great.

308
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:58.500
Basically what it does is it takes existing lots of records that conform to the neighborhood and allows them to be built by right.

309
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:16.500
It also adds an avenue for lots that may be oversized in those neighborhoods to be subdivided and go in front of the planning board and not have to go in front of the zoning board.

310
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:37.500
So I think the spirit of the of the bill is met and allows for more housing to be to be built in a neighborhood that already conforms but is just based on today's zoning regulations forced to follow a different step.

311
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.000
All right any other comments?

312
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.500
Show of hands okay for the amendment?

313
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500
All right.

314
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.000
I haven't called it yet.

315
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
All those in favor of amendment number 2025-05-79H, raise your hand now.

316
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Those opposed?

317
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
All right.

318
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
That's unanimous.

319
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
That's adopted.

320
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.500
So now we're on the ought to pass as amended motion.

321
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.000
Are there comments on this?

322
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
All right.

323
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:28.500
I'll let the clerk organized and as soon as she's ready the motion is ought to pass as amended with um 0579h vice chairman cole yes representative faxton representative aaron yes representative Yes.

Chairman, do you have copies of this amendment?

372
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.500
I know you sent it by email, but...

373
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.500
I thought you were passing it around, Representative.

374
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.500
Is it over there?

375
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.500
I think this is the event.

376
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.000
I just had a bunch of copies.

377
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
They're sitting here somewhere.

378
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I was going to say, I know who I passed.

379
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.500
The amendment number is 0687H.

380
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.000
It should be coming around.

381
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I had copies made.

382
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.500

383
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500
You're all set.

384
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.500
Okay.

385
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.500
Representative Dumont, where'd you...

386
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:31.000

0687.

388
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Does anybody have 0687?

389
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
All right.

390
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
We're going to recess for five minutes to get organized.

391
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Thank you.

392
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Thank you.

393
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:58.500
Okay, so as I was saying, I recognize myself to make a motion of ought to pass, and it's second by Representative Aaron or Cole.

394
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500
Cole.

395
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.000
And I'm going to move Amendment 2025-0687H.

396
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Is there a second to that?

397
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I'll second.

398
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Second by Representative Page.

399
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So to briefly speak to this amendment, I enjoy the underlying bill.

400
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I think it's a great bill.

401
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:29.000
But I also am a man of consensus, and I think that this will help move the needle.

402
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I think municipalities do arbitrarily mandate parking spaces in order to zone out certain dwellings in a community, and I think that's completely unfair.

403
00:29:41.000 --> 00:30:02.000
I also think that these Black Friday parking situations where you mandate hundreds of spots for a Walmart that it's going to be full one day a year, I think really does hurt the environmental impact, but also costs more on businesses.

404
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And I want to be pro-business, and I want to support the property rights.

405
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I think the free market is the best determinant over how many parking spaces are needed.

406
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
If there's not enough parking, people will not go to that business.

407
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.500
People will not live in that development.

408
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:37.500
But I think the free market is the best determinant, not an arbitrary number that's thrown out by us or anybody else.

409
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:51.500
So I'm moving this because this amendment will replace the bill, but it adds it restricts municipalities right to regulate more than one residential parking space per unit.

410
00:30:51.500 --> 00:31:01.500
This is a carbon copy of HB 1400 that was passed last biennium on the consent calendar in the House.

411
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:14.000
And then the committee of conference last year that I chaired, we ended up getting to a consensus with the other body for this language.

412
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.500
I would like to strike the language and go back to the original bill that we had.

413
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.000
So with that, I'm open to comments.

414
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Representative Bolio.

415
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Thank you, Mr.

416
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Chairman.

417
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:50.500
I completely agree with the comments that you made, and I would just like to add, you know, this isn't just some, you know, oh, hey, we're, you know, playing around with the number of parking spaces.

418
00:31:50.500 --> 00:32:01.000
The fact is, is New Hampshire is in a very, very serious housing crisis, is in a cost of living crisis.

419
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:14.500
And anything that we can do to empower the free market to deliver additional housing, I think, is something that should be seriously considered by the legislature.

420
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:29.000
and you know despite the fact that nobody likes to hunt around for parking space, I think at the end of the day, we all want a New Hampshire.

421
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:44.000
You know, if we had a choice, which New Hampshire do you want to live in a New Hampshire that has enough housing or New Hampshire that has enough parking?

422
00:32:44.000 --> 00:33:30.500
I think we should prioritize our friends and neighbors and we should advocate for a New Hampshire thathire that has enough housing before we worry about if new hampshire has enough parking representative reed my hand up but i'll say something because you saw it in my eyes and perhaps you knew what i was imagining when uh the representative from what's your town littleton, said what he said, because I remember a year ago saying the words and getting gaveled for them, that we have a housing crisis, not a parking crisis.

423
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500
So I agree.

424
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:43.000
I personally don't always think the free market is the best, but I acknowledge that it can be in certain situations.

425
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.500
Having said that, this is specific to residential, so I think one per residential unit is sufficient.

426
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500
Any other comments?

427
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.000
Is the show of hands on the amendment okay?

428
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.500
All right, don't raise your hand yet.

429
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:07.500
All those in favor of adopting Amendment 2025-0687H, raise your hand now.

430
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500
All those opposed.

431
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500
Amendment passes unanimous.

432
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.000
We're now on the ought to pass as amended.

433
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.500
Are there comments on that?

434
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:25.000
All right, seeing none, I'm going to have the clerk call the roll.

435
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
The motion is ought to pass as amended with HB 382 with Amendment 0687H.

436
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
The clerk's moving me nervous standing over there.

437
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000

528
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.500
Chairman Alexander.

529
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
Yes.

530
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.000
Motion carries 17 to 0.

531
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
No report needed.

532
00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:19.000
We're just going to retain this for the the fall the summer okay uh the next bill i'd like to call up is hb 631 relative to permitting residential building and commercial zoning by right and i want to call on representative page for a motion move out to pass representative page moves ought.

533
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Is there a second?

534
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Second by Representative Howland.

535
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Go ahead.

536
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Representative Page.

537
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
All right.

538
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Sure.

539
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.500
I'd also like to move Amendment 0667H.

540
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.500
Do you have a different one than me?

541
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500
I circulated one.

542
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.500
Oh, okay.

543
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:50.000
This is exactly what I sent via email other than the typo on line 11.

544
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.500
Is there a second to that motion?

545
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
A second.

546
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.000
Okay, second by Representative Reed.

547
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Go ahead.

548
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Great.

549
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Yes, and this is exactly the same amendment that I sent the committee by email, but the word zone has been corrected to zoned where there was that typo on line 11 and that's the only change that was made so i think i i appreciated the intent of this bill as we dug into it it seemed like there were more and more pieces of it that were unworkable as introduced but i'm hopeful that we've reached something workable here we tried to make sure that we still empowered municipalities to restrict residential development where there might be industrial uses in various commercial zones that were really incompatible with residential use.

550
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:20.500
And we also, one of the things that came up in the committee hearing was around the use of the ground floor and really trying to ensure that municipalities could still keep the spirit of sort of village districts where you would have commercial areas.

551
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:31.500
So we empowered municipalities to have, you know, make those determinations about how the ground floor would be used in the districts.

552
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:49.500
So we tried to ensure that we would control for those concerns that came up in the hearing while also pushing forward with the spirit of the bill, which is really to get more mixed-use development.

553
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:58.000
And I'm supportive of the goal and I hope this is a workable amendment for the committee.

554
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Other comments?

555
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Representative Bolio.

556
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Thank you, Mr.

557
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Chairman.

558
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.500
I just wanted to say, I mean, I really, really, really appreciate the spirit and intention of this bill.

559
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:23.000
I think, you know, mixed-use development is something which has historically occurred in New Hampshire.

560
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.500
I am very fortunate to be a resident of the town of Littleton.

561
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:42.500
For those of you who have been to Littleton, we have a very charming, you know, Main Street that is, you know, excellent, you know, retail.

562
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.500
It's walkable.

563
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:52.500
But if you look above all of those charming shops on Main Street, there are apartments.

564
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500
There are houses.

565
00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:29.000
so I think this is something that's not just unique to Littleton you see it again and again throughout our state and I think that it is a historic pattern of development in New Hampshire that should be welcomed and encouraged it's kind of nice if you are a city person to choose to live in an apartment and walk to the corner coffee shop and get a coffee.

566
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:41.500
So I think we should really, really encourage mixed-use development as part of the many things we can do to address New Hampshire's housing crisis.

567
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.500
All right.

568
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.000
Is the show of hands okay on the amendment?

569
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
All right.

570
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
The motion is by Representative Page to move Amendment 2025-0667H.

571
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
If you're in favor of Representative Page's amendment, raise your hand now.

572
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Opposed?

573
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
All right.

574
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Amendment passes.

575
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.500
We're now on the ought to pass as amended with 0-667H.

576
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.000
Is there any more discussion on that?

577
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
All right.

578
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.500
Seeing none, we'll have the clerk call the roll.

579
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.500
Vice Chairman Cole?

580
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.500

584
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.500
Yes.

585
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.500
Representative Bullyer?

586
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500
Yes.

587
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.500
Representative Dumont?

588
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.500
Yes.

589

Representative Grant?

590
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.500
Yes.

591
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.500
Representative Miles?

592
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.500
Not here.

593
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500
Representative Miner?

594
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.500
Yes.

595
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.500
Clerk Reinfort?

596
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.500
Yes.

597
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500
Representative Page?

598
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.500
Yes.

599
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.500
Representative Siebert, yes.

600
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.500
Representative Reed, yes.

601
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.500
Representative Gibbs, yes.

602
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.500
Representative Hicks, yes.

603
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.500
Representative Howland, yes.

604
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.500
Representative Hegner, yes.

605

Representative Kerwin, yes.

606
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.500
Chairman Alexander, yes.

607
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.000
Motion carries 17 to 0.

608
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.500
Is there an objection to this going on consent?

609
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.000
Seeing no, we're going to put it on consent.

610
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Representative Page, would you like to write that report, or do you want somebody else to?

611
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.500
Do I have any volunteers?

612
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.500
If you don't want to do it, I'll do it.

613
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.500
All right.

614
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500
Okay.

615
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:55.500
I may ask for the bullet points you want me to include.

616
00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:18.500
All right representative will write the report okay so that bill will go on consent um next up i want to have a quick discussion on hb 457 although i'm not ready to open the exec on it um i think the hearing was very interesting.

617
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.000
Let me find my amendment.

618
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.500
I think what's going on in Durham is a situation that I think is excessive government overreach.

619
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:44.500
And I think that in some ways the state needs to say that this is excessive government overreach, regulating who can live in what bedroom and what lifestyle somebody has.

620
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.000
I just think that isn't really a government business.

621
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.500
So I have an amendment.

622
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:59.500
I'm not ready to move it yet because there are a couple of things brought up.

623
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:18.500
Representative Dumont at one point mentioned the concern with sober houses and single-family neighborhoods and about how you may have non-familiar status and relationship, and that's not really necessarily what we want to deal with in this committee.

624
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:31.500
There's other committees for that, so I want to kind of get together with a few people and work on an amendment that will address that.

625
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.000
But is there other feedback?

626
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Representative Gibbs, go ahead.

627
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Thank you.

628
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:53.500
I've sponsored House Bill 432, which is in municipal and county government, which specifies that recovery houses, what includes sober houses, are to be treated the same as any other residents.

629
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.500
And that's in municipal county government.

630
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.500
They haven't finished with it yet.

631
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:12.500
But I should point out that under the Federal Fair Housing Act, recovery houses are required to be treated the same as other types of housing.

632
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:17.500
Otherwise, you would have discrimination against people with a disability.

633
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.500
Representative Howland.

634
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.000
So I've had this conversation.

635
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So in state fire code and life safety code, occupancy for almost everything is square foot per occupant.

636
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
There are two exceptions.

637
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
There's single family home and there's lodging houses.

638
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:47.500
And it's created because of that, neither of which has a square foot per occupant, it creates a lot of confusion.

639
00:48:47.500 --> 00:49:48.000
And I've seen this conversation for nine years and i've seen it botched every single time so i'll start out with it's how many people can you fit in a single family house families are defined by the municipality so there is a family you can put as many people in there as long as you meet sewer the state sewer waters you're going gonna have to pull a permit for that but there is no square footage for a family if you look in fire code in 618.1 it defines what a single family house is and that's really important because definitions define where you put them in your table of uses and where you let them in your community.

640
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And so a single family house is defined as it allows members of a single family and no more than three outsiders.

641
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:14.000
In Fire Code, they tried to clarify that also because we had like students coming here and they said, look, we just want to we want to share a house.

642
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:20.500
And there's a bunch of us and we want to share a house.

643
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:29.500
Well, when you get past three unrelated people, it is no longer classified as a single family house.

644
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.500
It undergoes a change of use.

645
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:36.000
It becomes a lodging or rooming house.

646
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.500
And that's really important because that dictates where your community will allow them.

647
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.500
All right.

648
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.500
And so that's created all kinds of issues.

649
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.500
I heard like discrimination against students.

650
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:59.000
In Durham, students can and do rent anywhere in our community, anywhere there's an apartment.

651
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:09.000
They're going to ask you for a guarantor so you can actually do the rent, but they can rent anywhere.

652
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
But we do not allow lodging houses in our zones.

653
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:23.500
To answer the question of this legislation that was proposed, which is no less than two beds per occupant.

654
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:36.500
So before this legislation, if it were to go through, how many people could fit, how many unrelated people could fit in a single family home?

655
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.500
Three.

656
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:46.500
After this legislation goes through, how many unrelated people could fit in a single family home?

657
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.000
And the answer is three.

658
00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Because at three, it is no longer a single familyfamily house it undergoes a change of use when you undergo that change of use to become a lodging house it first requires you buy its RSA 485 A38 you're gonna have to show that you can handle the increased capacity of your septic the second thing it's gonna require and that.3.6.1, is you're going to have to put in a sprinkler system.

659
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
All right.

660
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.500
And so the problem with this is there's no square footage in a lodging house.

661
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:46.500
A lodging house, once you said yes, you could have a lodging house, a lodging house can have up to 16 people in it.

662
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.500
All right.

663
00:52:48.500 --> 00:53:10.500
And so in this case where she's saying two per bedroom, well, if you're putting in a sprinkling system, which under the cheapest condition, if you're doing it, we're hooked up to sewer and water, it's probably going to cost you north of $30,000.

664
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:56.500
You're going to have a high incentive to try to cut that house up and get as many people in as possible and you can all the way up to 16 there's nothing in there so this says no less than two per bedroom well you can have an open concept and call it a bedroom and put 16 people in that house there's nothing to stop that and so uh it really makes it challenging for a municipality to say, yes, we do want to allow lodging houses in these areas.

665
00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:01.500
And Representative Gibbs' bill actually shows how difficult that is.

666
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.500
So addiction is classified as a disability, and it's covered.

667
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:11.000
They're a protected class under the American Disabilities Act.

668
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
All right.

669
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
But it's still hard to get a recovery house done.

670
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.500
Her bill, what it really says, is not that you can allow recovery houses anywhere.

671
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:32.500
What it's saying is we're going to treat the addicted residents as a family.

672
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:38.500
And therefore, that single-family house does not undergo a change of use.

673
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.000
It does not become a lodging house.

674
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.500
It stays as a single family house.

675
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:54.500
And why that's important is because single family houses are allowed in all residential, almost all residential zones.

676
00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:05.500
And therefore, if you do it that way, the recovery house skirts the need to actually go through the lodging house standard.

677
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.000
And so that's a problem.

678
00:55:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
So that recovery house that you would do there then because they're classified as a family there is no square footage per occupant a lot that is required so you can really put a lot of people in that house and so that meets a lot of resistance and that in municipal county is dealing with that and so i just talked to the sponsor before we started this about this i i totally understand the intent of this because we do need lodging houses lodging houses are recovery houses lodging houses can be transitional housing lodging houses could be a shelter for battered women but it is extremely difficult under the current way that is defined particularly with no square footage attached to it for a community to say yes i've talked to representative um fracked who's on the subcommittee over there that's working on the recovery houses and as i say i just talked to representative power i think we we definitely can do better than the two per per bedroom we need to come up with clarifying what the square footage is i don't know what that is offhand and i think we really need a group that has some experience in planning to sit down and work on it and craft something that's better this bill just doesn't do it in durham the reason that we do not allow lodging houses is not because we discriminate against students.

679
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.500
During the committee meeting, we heard a lot about student behavior.

680
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:22.000
In 2014, Durham really allowed a lot of construction of student apartments in our downtown.

681
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.500
And it's not in an industrial zone.

682
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500
It's near campus.

683
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:32.500
Most people that visit say it's a really nice area.

684
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:54.500
Why we did that is because if you allow a lodging house and you can allow up to 16 people in it, and essentially what was a single-family house, what happens, it drives up the aggregate rent and a family cannot rent that house.

685
00:57:54.500 --> 00:58:02.000
It really boxes out families from buying single family houses and we don't want that.

686
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
And that's why we put it in place.

687
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:17.500
In terms of student behavior, when we put in well-managed apartments, we put in a community police officer that works with the deans.

688
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:36.000
We've seen a, and the large apartments that we put in, if you're familiar with Durham, across from where our frats are, what used to be kind of some rundown green apartments, we put in Madbury Commons.

689
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.500
Madbury Commons is 732 beds of housing.

690
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:49.000
When you come downhill from where the church is, it's called Church Hill, we put in the campus flats.

691
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
That's 768 beds of student housing.

692
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
We also put in Ted Madbury, which is another 100.

693
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000
They're all really well-managed apartment complexes that have on-site security.

694
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:37.500
we've seen again a dramatic decline we used to i don't know if any of you are you know young enough to remember what cinco de mayo was in the early 2000s uh or any of you had any idea of like how many on a week how many students on a weekend would get tagged for internal uh possession of alcohol it could be up to a per each day.

695
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.000
We've seen that decline to almost nothing.

696
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
And why is that?

697
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:53.500
Because managed departments, along with a community police officer, along working with UNH, has really solved what was a behavioral problem.

698
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:59.000
So it's a red herring to say it's a behavior issue.

699
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:18.000
What it really is, is we don't like it because the per bed pricing and the unrestricted up to 16 that you would allow in a single family house means that families cannot rent or buy those houses.

700
01:00:18.000 --> 01:01:22.500
And so that's why we're not allowing it just to try to address what we've seen is the the issue for the missing middle we put in workforce housing overlays the workforce housing overlay that we've had has upwards of 200 units and all of those units would be tied to fmr fair market rent uh we think that that really will provide additional housing that will meet more needs and so while i appreciate the sentiment of the bill it doesn't really fix anything a community can still say we don't want lodging houses and and you won't have lodging houses a single family house if you put the two bedroom rule in place you can actually only fill one bedroom and one person in the other bedroom.

701
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:29.500
If you have a four-bedroom house, you're not going to fill all four bedrooms.

702
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.500
So it doesn't fix the issue.

703
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
That's my two cents.

704
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Okay.

705
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
Other comments?

706
01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500
All right.

707
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:48.000
Well, with that information, I'm going to hold off for a few weeks on this.

708
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.500
Not sure what I want to do.

709
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500
Maybe a retain, something like that.

710
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.000
We'll see how it goes.

711
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:36.500
but we have so what's left in this committee's hands that we have not represent page I just I wanted to just piggybacking on some of what representative Howland said I think it's interesting that we have another bill and another committee that deals with the same lodging house issue Just piggybacking on some of what Representative Howland said, I think it's interesting that we have another bill and another committee that deals with the same lodging house issues.

712
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:52.500
I don't know how we would structure it, but I wonder if there might be a way to connect our work on this bill with the work that's happening on that bill.

713
01:02:52.500 --> 01:03:13.000
Whether we retain it, I don't know that we have time to do a subcommittee now, but I would think that these are very connected bills and connected issues, and it would be wise for us to be working in tandem.

714
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I agree with you.

715
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Let me confer with Representative Power and see where she's at on that bill.

716
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So we have the bills that we have not yet acted on.

717
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:42.000
We have three left HP 296, which we went over today, that's relative to the The bills that we have not yet acted on, we have three left.

718
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.500
HB 296, which we went over today, that's relative to the building permits along roads.

719
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.000
HB 410, there's a subcommittee at 1 o'clock today.

720
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.500
Representative Reid will be heading that up.

721
01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.000
And then HB 457 that we have just discussed.

722
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.500
The rest of the bills that we have left in our possession we have retained.

723
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:16.500
So we can focus on doing work on those or not over the summer.

724
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:22.500
Other than that, that's what we're going to get our Senate bills.

725
01:04:22.500 --> 01:05:12.000
So my hope is hopefully if we can have a quick exec during a session day or something like that, so I don't have to pull the committee back for a full like 30 less than 30 minutes of work um would probably be best so I'm thinking about doing some sort of uh executive session I'll announce that on a session day and I'll confer with representative page so it's not like I surprise my friends across the aisle so thank you um that's not how we do things here all right anything Anything else before this committee?

726
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Okay.

727
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000

Thank you.

877

Thank you.

879
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Thank you.

Thank you.

888
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500
Thank you.

889
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
Thank you.

890
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Thank you.

891
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500
Thank you.

892

893
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500
Thank you.

894
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
Thank you.

895
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
Thank you.

896
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
Thank you.

897
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
Thank you.

898
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
Thank you.

899
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500
Thank you.

900
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Hi, y'all.

901
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:07.000
We're going to convene the subcommittee on HB 410.

902
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:15.500
So, there was a lot of feedback during the hearing of things that needed to be improved.

903
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:21.000
Language, it seems like everybody's on board with the general gist.

904
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:34.500
I've had the Institute of Justice as well as Mercatus give their feedback and told them about the different aspects that were brought up during the hearing.

905
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:42.500
And so this is a print of a Google Doc that those parties had access to.

906
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:52.500
I did send out a slightly older version of this to everybody just so you knew what was being discussed.

907
01:11:52.500 --> 01:12:02.000
So just from the top, and then we can get into like different ideas and what we all think.

908
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So one of the things was really tightening up the language on what the heck this evidence that a town a town would have to provide so we switch it to the governing body which as i understand it and i'm happy to recognize brody if he needs to correct me in most towns the legislative body is the people the governing body is the select board or council but in, no?

909
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And turn on your mic when you speak.

910
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Yeah, these are, I believe these are streamed.

911
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They're noticed.

912
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.500
They have to be noticed.

913
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.500
So.

914
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.000
Okay, I could be wrong.

915
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I don't know that the legislative body and the governing body, I believe, are one and the same.

916
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
In some towns.

917
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So what I had explained to me is that, and maybe you're the one who did this, so maybe you should take over, but that in some towns, depending on the charter, you can switch the legislative body to be one and the same as the governing body.

918
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So since we have something, so the best way to describe it, governing body and legislative body is a role, and your municipality delegates what those roles are.

919
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So in some cases, the governing body will be the select board, and then the voters are the legislative body.

920
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
In my town, which is a town charter, they've delegated.

921
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.500
So the town council is both the governing body and the legislative body.

922
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500
So that's why.

923
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:16.000
So the best way is there are a role in your community decides who does those roles.

924
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Is that a halfway decent way?

925
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.000
So on this bill, do you want to make it legislative slash governing body?

926
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.000
So I think maybe I'll just talk to OLS lawyer to be extra clear on it.

927
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.500
But my understanding is, so for example, the state, the legislative body isn't the voters.

928
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.000
We are the legislative body.

929
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.500
And then there's a governing body in the other branch, right?

930
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:59.500
So in a smaller traditional town, the legislative body is the people and the governing body is the select board.

931
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:13.000
But what I understand from Al is that in some cities, just like in the state level, you shift the legislative body up to the elected officials.

932
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:25.500
In the cities, you would shift the legislative body up to the city council, and then you would have a mayor in addition to that.

933
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
You can do it.

934
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:32.000
So in a town charterâ€” Are you itching to...

935
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I'm not itching, but...

936
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.500
I will recognize Brody DeShase from NHMA.

937
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
Thank you.

938
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:59.000
So it gets complicated with charters because when you have a charter, a city charter, a town charter, the way that they do delegate what is a legislative body and what is a governing body is dictating their charter.

939
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:24.500
Now, if you're not chartered, which is a vast majority of municipalities throughout the state, your legislative body are the voters, the people who go to town meeting, whether it's SB2 and you go to the first session, the second session by ballot, or you go to the entire town meeting.

940
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:31.500
So using governing body here, most municipalities would probably mean your board of selectmen.

941
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:47.000
Now, considering this is a land use issue, what you might be trying to cite is like a specific land use board as defined in RSA 62, 672, I should say.

942
01:16:47.000 --> 01:17:01.500
So using that definition or, you know, choosing one of those land use boards that municipalities that have zoning are allowed to adopt, that I think is the intent.

943
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:19.500
I could be incorrect, but from what I remember from the hearing on House Bill 410, your goal was that there was some kind of way for people to have redress with that land use board.

944
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:34.000
Not specifically the Board of selectmen who have very limited control over land usage and not the legislative body because the legislative body in most municipalities is the people.

945
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:46.500
So I'm from a town council and in my town it works as everything comes from the planning board and goes through the town council.

946
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.000
Everything ultimately goes to the town council.

947
01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Is that not the case with a select board no no so in my town it's it's it's my i'm an sb2 town and this is true for you know non-sb2 towns but the planning board crafts warrant articles gotcha they have a hearing they then present them to the legislative body either at the town meeting if it's traditional or via the ballot um at the second session and then me as part of the legislative body, either at the town meeting, if it's traditional, or via the ballot at the second session.

948
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:49.500
And then me as part of the legislative body, you know, and the other voters, we say yay or nay to those zoning ordinance changes.

949
01:18:49.500 --> 01:19:00.500
So I'm looking at an amendment on a different bill in the language OLS gave me, and I'll just substitute governing body.

950
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:47.500
I'll say governing body or local land use board may or shall or whatever that is that would that be language that covers the intended i think for your intent it might also be worth um citing the specific rsas for what each one would cover under like for example you might want to cite in like you know governing board under rsa you know for those that are chartered communities or land usage board under RSA, you know, and I believe it's 672 colon might be one, but don't hold me on that.

951
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.500
Representative Dax, can you add your hand up?

952
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500
No, go ahead.

953
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.500
I think that's all you guys need me for, right?

954
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.500
Thanks.

955
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:17.500
My concern is that we're going to create a problem where there isn't one because we're not quite sure what the right wording is, because I would respectfully disagree with what was just said.

956
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:28.500
In SB2 towns and in town meeting towns, so in the specific case of my town, the planning board proposes zoning changes.

957
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500
They have their hearings.

958
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.500
That's fine.

959
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:53.500
However, the select board in a town meeting town, it's the selectman's warrant, and we can put whatever we as a selectman, we can craft a zoning change and put it on the warrant, whether the planning board likes it or not.

960
01:20:53.500 --> 01:21:01.500
And you can also put, I just did it, so I know I can do it.

961
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
No, there's a technique.

962
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:08.000
Wait, the chair recognizes the shades of an HMA.

963
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:16.000
That's a very new statute where zoning ordinance amendments can originate from the Board of Selectmen.

964
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:29.500
And there actually was a hearing in front of municipal and county where a bill to actually repeal that power, but your voters gave you that power.

965
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:40.500
So in the municipalities where voters have provided their Board of Selectmen that power to propose zoning ordinance changes, you are correct.

966
01:21:40.500 --> 01:22:28.500
So that means your voters gave you that permission permission but in the vast we didn't even know that there were any towns that uh that actually had done that power we've been wondering if any have done it so at least we know of one but in most municipalities we didn't know we couldn't the select would have been running this since 1815 well that's a um because we didn't even have zoning until about 25 years ago so well what passed for zoning was a selectman put something on the warrant or by petition.

967
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:37.000
The great John Locke said that governments are only legitimate in that we give our popular consent.

968
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:46.500
So I think even when rules have been broken, if everybody goes along with it, apparently that's what happens.

969
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:53.000
So let me, because I don't want to keep us for four hours.

970
01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's can we agree that the language which I'm basing on what I heard from everyone, I think, and what I got on a different bill from OLS, that governing body or local land use board.

971
01:23:11.000 --> 01:24:00.500
Does that cover what we need to cover for the entity offering the evidence i think you want to add legislative because some if you if you put that rule in front of troy they'd be which is where i live or fitz william which i represent they'd be going governing body what the hell is that uh representative bolear yeah so uh this was this was something that, you know, when I was just trying to maintain the spirit of this, but, you know, I just took a stab at, you know, how would I revise this bill?

972
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:13.000
And I left it at a local legislative body of a city, town, or county in which there are located unincorporated towns or unorganized places.

973
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:36.500
And that was the language that the other part of the RSA used, because as far as I imagine it, adopting or enforcing any of these extraordinary restrictions, that authority is going to, whatever that restriction is, is going to have to originate in a legislative body.

974
01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:42.000
So whatever it is, I thought legislative body, but I would.

975
01:24:42.000 --> 01:25:33.500
But we can't prohibit people from voting on something right so they can't they can adopt right uh but but it wouldn't be enforceable if we word it a different way um so we could we could take out adopt and say we could say shall not enforce any extraordinary you know so i think it's more because you can just say municipality for that matter and it's more in terms of where the ordinance is a municipality may not enforce an ordinance that um without and i think the main thing is saying which body is the one that's providing the evidence.

976
01:25:33.500 --> 01:26:31.000
And so that's,dy is do you have a comment oh okay how about we we restructure it to say in such a way that uh whatever method a municipality or county has adopted for planning and it shall we're so we're not changing that methodology so if you're no you're just saying like however you adopt whatever you're doing how whenever you can't do this right that's that's accurate i mean it's more important to say which body the evidence is coming out of is it the planning board is it the select board and i think saying governing body or local land use board covers both of those and town council and anything else.

977
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.000
All of those are either a local land use board or a governing body.

978
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Yeah, I was just going to add, you know, maybe we should take it to where, you know, go over some of the changes you have and then some of the things I have.

979
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.500
Because I came out this from, I think, a different angle.

980
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500
Okay.

981
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.500
All right.

982
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:11.500
So one of the â€“ so I'm just going to keep working through this.

983
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:27.500
And if you don't mind, just because I'm not, I'm looking at mine, if you want to interject when I get to a place where you have a different, like a different.

984
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
Okay.

985
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500
All right.

986
01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:36.500
So one of the questions was, what is empirical evidence?

987
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Empirical evidence is by the way, it's tested of it.

988
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.500
It's, it's fact.

989
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:47.500
It's like it happens in the real world.

990
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.500
It's not theoretical.

991
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:58.000
Empirical is something that's existing, not theoretical, but the way Montana, because Montana had a similar bill.

992
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.500
I didn't realize that they had a similar bill.

993
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.500
So great minds.

994
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:16.000
Montana has very specific specific and I think the intent of the committee is to provide a very high bar for that evidence.

995
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Right.

996
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000
So we don't want just any old like, you know, Time magazine article thrown in there.

997
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And that's the evidence.

998
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:40.500
So they have detailed written findings of fact, including quantitative and empirical evidence of the best current scientific understanding published by nonpartisan peer review source.

999
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:58.000
And then if you go down a little bit later, we'll get back to a grieved person because that RSA is not correct anymore since we're taking it to the superior court instead of ZBA.

1000
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:16.000
it says that they have to demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence that the challenge ordinance is directly necessary, narrowly tailored, and the least restrictive means to promote the government interest in public health and safety.

1001
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:24.000
So those three things come out of Montana language, and that sets a really high bar.

1002
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.500
And that enforcement will be stayed until the appeal.

1003
01:29:28.500 --> 01:30:07.000
Yeah, on the empirical evidence issue, which I think is good, I was thinking, my thought has been on this, it should include language that says, shall include but not be limited to and give examples of statistical information available from governmental research, third party, some give a list of things so that we're not, again, not dealing with a Newsweek article or a Time Magazine article or, you know, my son's eighth grade report on trees.

1004
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.500
So I'm imagining government departments, institutions, public university research.

1005
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:21.000
How about I answer that by sending you an email with what I think the right word should be.

1006
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
All right.

1007
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So I have a really good idea of doing something.

1008
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yeah.

1009
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Did you want to say it?

1010
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:49.000
So just the whole narrowly tailored least restrictive means to me, like they're going for the strict scrutiny standard of, you know, when judicial review, whereas currently in New Hampshire, it's the.

1011
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.500
I'm, I'm drawing a total blank here.

1012
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:57.500
It is the it's the least restrictive legal review standard.

1013
01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.000
I think it's the reasonable basis standard.

1014
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So there's three.

1015
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
There's strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and reasonable basis.

1016
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.500
Currently, we're at the lowest.

1017
01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:23.500
This is trying to flip it to the highest, which I think because courts view that as they understand that language, that's going to raise the evidentiary bar.

1018
01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:32.500
So instead of us trying to â€“ and this is kind of why mine is so much shorter.

1019
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:36.000
It's not that the spirit is different.

1020
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.500
It's that we are putting this higher standard in the statute.

1021
01:31:41.500 --> 01:32:03.500
But in terms of rules of evidence and weighing the evidence, we should, in my opinion, leave it for the judicial branch to, you know, do that job because they've already kind of carved a path to have these ordinances subjected to higher scrutiny.

1022
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500
Right.

1023
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:21.500
So the, I don't know if this is the language you were thinking of, but in the original bill, it was the findings that they would find by preponderance of the evidence.

1024
01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:26.000
And that's like the really low level of evidence.

1025
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Right, right.

1026
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.500
Whereas clear and convincing evidence is a higher bar.

1027
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.500
Right.

1028
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.500
So that's in terms of the evidentiary standard.

1029
01:32:38.500 --> 01:33:22.500
But there's separately when you are doing a challenge like Institute for Justice does a lot of challenges to state regulations and stuff stuff like that when you are putting a constitutional challenge against a statute you are looking um this is the standard that applies when you're saying does this statute violate you know somebody's constant you know um either equal protection or substantial due process or whatever so it is another legal standard just like the standard for evidence a legal standard, but they're two separate.

1030
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.000
It's kind of where the burden is.

1031
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Yeah.

1032
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.500
So that's another thing too.

1033
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Yes.

1034
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.500
It's where the burden is allocated.

1035
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:46.500
So in strict scrutiny, I believe the government has the burden of proof, whereas on rational basis, it is not the government.

1036
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:53.000
Does anything you're saying, are you proposing a change to that first paragraph?

1037
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Roman number one?

1038
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Yeah.

1039
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:11.500
So what I was kind of thinking was let's just short circuit a lot of this in terms of, okay, here's what kind of study you have to have.

1040
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
Is it peer reviews?

1041
01:34:13.500 --> 01:35:08.000
that and so let's let's go straight to the heart of it which is right now what we have in new hampshire is you can enact any zoning ordinance you want um as long as it as long as it's you know as long as it's under an authority that you have under the zoning enabling act but also that it can pass this um this uh rational basis standard so what i proposed was let's say for these certain things, if what you're doing, if you're creating this extraordinary restriction on residential property, then in that instance, that particular regulation, you're not going to have this lowest standard.

1042
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:33.500
You're going to have, and I wrote the intermediate standard, so we'd have it for reference, but I was actually going to leave it up to the subcommittee to decide whether it would be strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny, but a higher level of scrutiny when these certain things are triggered.

1043
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:43.500
And also the basis for those restrictions in the draft that I have, I have it as health and safety.

1044
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:52.000
And the reason why is because general welfare is this giant door that the court has opened.

1045
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.500
That's in the original bill.

1046
01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:07.000
I didn't include general welfare in the original bill because it's a huge nebulous term that, you know, my property values would fall under, right?

1047
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:18.500
And I even tried, there was comment during the hearing that, well, you know, the term usually is health, safety, and general welfare.

1048
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.500
So can you include general welfare?

1049
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:27.000
And I said, only if we very, very tightly defined it.

1050
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And I tried with IJ and Mercatus to take a stab at tightly defining general welfare.

1051
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And no matter how we did it, there were giant, you know, you could foresee a town coming up with any number.

1052
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I tried to say it had to deal with environmental pollution of noise, light, air, water.

1053
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:02.500
And they're like, we were all coming up with ways that a town could get around that.

1054
01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:10.500
So we just decided to go with the original version, which left out general welfare entirely.

1055
01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:14.000
And I'm fine with putting strict scrutiny.

1056
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.500
And I think what you're saying is that belongs in the appeals language.

1057
01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:39.500
I was saying, you know, the way I had it was, let's just have it in terms of the actual authority, which is the town has the authority under the zoning ordinance are under the zoning enabling act.

1058
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:50.000
The town has the authority to enact, you know, health, safety, general welfare, and it has a list of certain things.

1059
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.500
I was going to take that and said, yes, you have that authority.

1060
01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:15.000
However, if it implicates one of these extraordinary restrictions, your authority is narrowed, and it has to be either health or safety, and it has to be at a higher standard, either intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny.

1061
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
So that doesn't necessitate any appeals.

1062
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
In my mind, it doesn't necessarily.

1063
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.500
Well, you need an appeal.

1064
01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:28.000
You need an appeals because it'll be representative Helen.

1065
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:36.000
So I was just going to say, because you're doing health and safety of the community.

1066
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So I was going to say, can you reference 674-17, which is the purposes of zoning?

1067
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Because when you're talking about the enabling legislation, what you're supposed to do when you do zoning is follow 674.17, which is this is the purpose of zoning.

1068
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:10.500
So what you're putting in are in that it's not just, well, health and safety is in there, but it lists like to lessen congestion.

1069
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Of course, security, safety from fire, panic, and dangers, promote health and general welfare, adequate light and air.

1070
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.500
So I think we should reference the thing.

1071
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:28.500
The reason you do your zoning is because of 674.

1072
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:33.500
The thing that you're supposed to be doing is 674.17.

1073
01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:38.500
So can we reference what you're supposed to be doing?

1074
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:46.500
Well, I'm not opposed to referencing it, but you just said general welfare in the list.

1075
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:59.500
And the nebulousness of that list is kind of the problem because if it wasn't a problem, we wouldn't have the zoning situation we have now.

1076
01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
Right?

1077
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:09.000
The fact that that list is, I mean, that brings up a whole other thing.

1078
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.000
We could go after that list and tighten up that list directly.

1079
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But I think that's, you know, kind of broader scope than just saying specific.

1080
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I know, calm, calm, it's okay.

1081
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.500
It's like, leave it alone.

1082
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
Leave 674 alone.

1083
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:32.000
Actually, this is in 674.17.

1084
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.500
So this is in the same section of law.

1085
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:45.500
But the point being that we, the point of this bill is to create this extraordinary restrictions concept.

1086
01:40:45.500 --> 01:41:20.500
And that will be a bucket and what we put in that bucket we can decide now and later and what have you but um we want this concept that extraordinary restrictions are a thing and we can define what that thing is but they need to be treated differently than other ordinances um i guess I'm still struggling to understand what change you're trying to make here, Representative Bollier.

1087
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.000
Do you have the specific language change?

1088
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Yeah.

1089
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Well, so what I was going to say is I put the intermediate scrutiny standard in mind, but I'd be happy to do the strict scrutiny standard, which is the language that you have about the narrowly tailored and least restrictive means.

1090
01:41:47.000 --> 01:42:03.500
To me, that's coming from a strict scrutiny standard, and we can actually â€“ I think New Hampshire, it's compelling government interest and must be necessary to the accomplishment of its legitimate purpose.

1091
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:22.500
I mean, it's legalese, but a court will definitely know what this means and what the standard of review is and what kind of evidence the government needs to bring forward, and it is a very high standard.

1092
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:32.000
So I think by doing that, we don't have to go into the weeds about, well, is this empirical?

1093
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Is this?

1094
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:56.500
because me, you know, the way the statute is currently proposed, some of this, I think, you know, the town is going to choke on, the courts are going to choke on, and there's going to be a lot of opportunities for attorneys to litigate.

1095
01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:59.500
well, what exactly does this mean?

1096
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:20.000
Whereas this, my proposal is let's do something that courts and attorneys already know and understand, but it is going to accomplish the spirit of this, which is if you're doing an extraordinary restriction, then you need to have strict scrutiny.

1097
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.500
You have a compelling government.

1098
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:27.000
It does say compelling government interest in the amendment.

1099
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:41.500
But I don't necessarily buy the idea that not requiring this high level of fact finding is going to be equally a check on the towns as requiring it.

1100
01:43:41.500 --> 01:44:00.000
I think requiring it is a type of check in and of itself because the town's far less likely to even attempt to pass something if they can't get the research and they can't show their work.

1101
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
So they're not even going to attempt it.

1102
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And also, like, if they know that that fact isn't going to hold up in court, they're not likely to do it.

1103
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Right.

1104
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So I think that not having it at all opens the door more than having it.

1105
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.500
Does anybody else want to weigh in, Representative Axton?

1106
01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:33.000
Well, yeah, I agree with your reasoning.

1107
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.500
I wanted to come back to the two proposals.

1108
01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:43.500
And so I'm feeling, I'm thinking that Representative Bolio's revisions, which are.

1109
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
I like simpler.

1110
01:44:45.500 --> 01:45:35.000
And so I think on the rework that I'm going to call yours, you're trying to fix this, which would be the way I would kind of go, but I'm not sure simpler isn't better in terms of getting it out there, getting it through both getting it signed and most importantly if it if all of that happens getting it so that the towns understand it sometimes this is this is like less is more situation just say you can't do this stuff and you have to back up your work, and you can take it from there.

1111
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Representative Bowling?

1112
01:45:37.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Well, the other thing I wanted to say is that if you have this strict scrutiny standard in here and a town just ignores it, then the town has basically set themselves up for whatever their extraordinary restriction is to get struck down by the courts.

1113
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:19.500
Well, I mean, that's kind of where I didn't really buy the argument that the courts are going to get choked up on these things because you're providing more evidence and more standard than if you don't provide that.

1114
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:32.000
Then that means to me that the courts are going to get more choked up on that because they have less definition to go by.

1115
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
No.

1116
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:45.500
I mean, a big function of the court is to weigh the evidence and to understand, OK, what is a compelling government interest?

1117
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:56.000
And there's a very big body of case law which has developed about, well, what kind of evidence meets that burden?

1118
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
What kind of evidence would meet strict scrutiny?

1119
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:10.500
And because strict scrutiny is tied into things like civil rights and things like that, it is a very high standard.

1120
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:40.500
It's not a standard that I think the court would arbitrarily chip away on, but it's also, you know, by making this simpler, there's less possible, I think, objection when you take this to the entire legislative body or the committee, because I think a lot of people said, well, what is empirical or, well, what is scientific, like non-peer?

1121
01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:51.500
I mean, that's things that people can really, I think, debate and courts can debate because it's not a legally established standard.

1122
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:58.500
And I mean, I know I'm probably talking more like an attorney here, but.

1123
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:02.000
Well, I guess that's a good question.

1124
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.500
Are there any attorneys here?

1125
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500
Oh, OK.

1126
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
You are.

1127
01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:15.500
OK, because this was actually written by the draft before you, the amendment draft.

1128
01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.500
One attorney through IJ and one through Mercatus.

1129
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:23.500
So it's two attorneys that dealt with that.

1130
01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.500
I'll be it.

1131
01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.500
I don't.

1132
01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:32.000
The one through IJ has practiced in New Hampshire.

1133
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.500
I don't think the one.

1134
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.500
And yeah.

1135
01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:47.000
And I mean, I wouldn't hold myself out as like, oh, yes, I'm a municipal law attorney or anything like that.

1136
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.500
I will say if you get three attorneys, you'll get four different opinions.

1137
01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.500
Right.

1138
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.500
At least.

1139
01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:40.000
So, you know, just as a selectman and a guy who's developed lands, and I've watched the back and forth that goes on, I think that there would be would be a if you wound up in superior court in cheshire county and you had passed some ordinance some restrictive ordinance counter with this law on the books and your reasoning was nothing more than nimbyism i don't want it my backyard, I think the court would be able to see through that very confident.

1140
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:52.000
A big piece that seemed to resonate and I think will resonate in the Senate, the other body, is the show your work concept.

1141
01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:02.500
And I think that including the fact-finding and having a high standard for that fact-finding is the show your work heart.

1142
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.500
That's the important piece of it.

1143
01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:15.000
So I'm really kind of reluctant to give up on the idea of them having to show the science.

1144
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.500
I don't disagree with you on that.

1145
01:50:18.500 --> 01:51:26.500
I think you can do that, but I think you can have a shorter version of that which is the this proposed version and attorney abolio's version versus the longer more complicated version i like simple not that different it's it's it's like okay the the paragraph one is uh you have like maybe two sentences in this one albeit it looks long because we have some struck out pieces but it's um it's you know maybe four sentences instead of two so i personally really love the show your work and i think that that that sounds really good um and that's one of the things like when i was drafting i like stayed until one of the morning working on this um that was one of the things where i really liked that piece.

1146
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:40.000
The reason I settled on this, you know, is because I think it's easier for, so some people are going to like the show your work idea.

1147
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Other people are going to say, what are you doing to my local control?

1148
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.500
And, you know, oh, great.

1149
01:51:49.500 --> 01:52:01.000
Now, every time we want to change something, the town's going to have to pay for this expensive study and all these experts.

1150
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:10.500
And that is going to get a lot of the fiscal hawks to come out against it in droves.

1151
01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:21.000
So I was thinking, okay, if you have a strict scrutiny standard, they are going to have to show their work.

1152
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.000
They can't just come up with a reasonable basis or ad hoc or whatever.

1153
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:41.500
They're actually going to have to say, look, in order to accomplish this health or safety goal, this is the lightest touch that we have to do.

1154
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:46.500
And they're going to have to bring darn good evidence.

1155
01:52:46.500 --> 01:53:03.500
And when I was looking at some of the case law about this, they were talking about, okay, well, we did a scientific study and we had experts and all of this other stuff.

1156
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:14.000
That's the kind of evidence that a municipality is naturally going to want to bring in order to enforce their ordinance.

1157
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:30.000
So I think by doing this, what you want, which is this high-quality scientific empirical evidence that the towns are not just acting arbitrarily, I think will come with the higher standard.

1158
01:53:30.000 --> 01:54:14.000
But we don't need to write it out in statute because I think if you write it out in statute, it's kind of like the more words you give attorneys to work with, the more ways they're going to say, well, actually an empirical study means this or this isn't workable or this is â€“ or you're going to â€“ what will more likely happen is if it's too complicated for people to see and they'll say, oh, now towns have to pay for studies to enact zoning.

1159
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I'm going to vote against that.

1160
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I really wanted something that had good opportunity to actually happen, in my opinion.

1161
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I mean, all the points are well taken.

1162
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I don't think that it means that they have to pay for a study.

1163
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I don't think it's implying that.

1164
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And I think anybody who argues that would be not arguing in good faith.

1165
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
But that happens quite frequently, as we know.

1166
01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:03.500
Does anybody else have any other, anybody else who hasn't, anybody else want to weigh in on the question of to show your work or not show your work?

1167
01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:06.000
I like the simpler version.

1168
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Same reason as Representative Bolio says.

1169
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
The simpler, the better.

1170
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Planning boards are going to look at that and say, forget it, I'm not doing it.

1171
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
That's kind of the point, actually.

1172
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:31.500
Yeah, but they're going to do their zoning changes anyway, and then setting themselves up for lawsuits or whatever.

1173
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:36.000
But I don't think it's going to stop anybody.

1174
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Representative Hicks.

1175
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:48.500
So I was just thinking of planning boards and the finding of facts, and maybe Brody can weigh in on this.

1176
01:55:48.500 --> 01:56:01.000
So planning board meetings, I don't know when it started, but we're required now to state our findings of fact before we make a decision.

1177
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.500
And it is simply that.

1178
01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:14.000
Like we have to announce what the findings of fact are to go along with, but they are not necessarily empirical.

1179
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Right.

1180
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:49.000
was just thinking pretty simple but in a it could be challenged if our findings of fact were not actual facts right if we made our decisions based on something that wasn't presented as testimony or evidence but if it's challenged and we had the language then the court could easily strike it down like you clearly weren't using empirical, quantitative evidence from a peer-reviewed source.

1181
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.500
You clearly weren't doing this.

1182
01:56:51.500 --> 01:57:00.000
But if they didn't have that language, then finding a fact is just a finding a fact.

1183
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:08.500
And the court won't know what to do with it and will have more of a question.

1184
01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:14.500
And that's kind of what I'm arguing to keep it in for.

1185
01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:56.000
But if I outnumbered then I am outnumbered like like you said I think this this this builds a framework and if if we if this actually makes it through and this becomes New Hampshire law and very quickly we're going to start to see a body of case law develop and if that is developing in a way that is not helpful then we can revisit this this and say, no, actually, we want this additional evidentiary standard or something like that.

1186
01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:12.500
But I think this really, I, you know, I think this really puts the foot in the door to actually, you know, to have, hey, strict scrutiny for extraordinary restrictions of residential property.

1187
01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:31.500
I mean, that, that's a huge, I think, if you are for loosening some of the zoning, you know, the overzealous zoning, I think that's a pretty powerful tool that you're giving, you know, people to challenge that.

1188
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:52.000
I mean, yeah, it's better than what we have, but the very, the idea that you just said that like, well, if they start not finding in their, you know, the better direction, then, you know, then we can revisit it.

1189
01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:00.500
That's kind of what's been happening for the last hundred years that we're trying to change, right?

1190
01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:06.000
Is the fact that the momentum has always been against people.

1191
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Yeah, go ahead.

1192
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:16.500
So the body of case law has always been, you know, you know, just, you know, reasonable.

1193
01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:20.500
It's always been the lowest, you know, standard.

1194
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:40.000
And, you know, somewhat recently, the New Hampshire Supreme Court actually made it even lower, you know, in terms of rational basis, you don't even have to look, I think, at, you know, whether anybody's individual rights are implicated.

1195
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So the fact is, is that if the court were to do something that, you know, weaken strict scrutiny, like I said, it's tied to civil rights law.

1196
01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:02.000
They're not going to do that because of all the other things that it's tied into.

1197
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:09.500
So I think this would I think this would be a pretty, pretty powerful tool.

1198
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:42.500
And it would make, you know, the towns have to show their work, you know, when they go to court, if it gets challenged or better yet, they just don't enforce and say, you know what, we don't want to, you know, we don't actually have a good reason that would survive strict security after talking to town council about our burden of proof on this.

1199
02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:50.000
We're just not going to enforce our restriction that requires, you know, a 10-acre minimum.

1200
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:54.500
I think you'll find a lot of that happening.

1201
02:00:54.500 --> 02:01:06.000
Okay, so once again, I want to not get too beleaguered onto one point because we haven't even gotten to the actual bucket.

1202
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:16.000
But I will say that, and so this is halfway through the first paragraph, and maybe we can revisit it.

1203
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:26.000
It sounds like most of the people on the subcommittee don't want to include actual fact finding requirement in this.

1204
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Am I correct?

1205
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Well, it looks like the three Republicans agree.

1206
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Do I have anything from Democrats?

1207
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Do I need to take an official vote?

1208
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Well.

1209
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:48.500
I mean, you were telling me to include like a list including but not limited.

1210
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.500
I don't know.

1211
02:01:50.500 --> 02:02:39.000
official vote well i mean you were telling me to include like a list including but not limited yeah i'm i'm i i like the shorter version but i really think that we should have i think it is reasonable to say i think you need to give an example and say it can be but not limited to you know reports from the New Hampshire so you're saying give an example but then don't say quantitative and empirical of best current scientific understanding from a nonpartisan I think that's the more important piece than the example.

1212
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Right.

1213
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:52.500
See, my concern is if you say the empirical part, I don't want to say you're shooting over people's heads, but I think...

1214
02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.500
I mean, they have Webster's, right?

1215
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:59.000
They can look it up if they...

1216
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Yeah, one would hope.

1217
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.500
Well, the courts have Merriam-Webster 3rd edition that they have to...

1218
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:55.500
I don't want it to have to go that far so I think you know I you know what do I think I hate to be the guy sitting on the fence uh but I guess I am I think it needs to have some definition and some limitation some kind I don't want some at least have some definition but it should be there there should be some, I'm concerned about saying empirical evidence quantitative or empirical evidence why does because sometimes in planning and zoning it doesn't always work that way so before I recognize Mr.

1219
02:03:55.500 --> 02:04:02.500
Deshaies, maybe I can try with the other lawyers and maybe I bring Rep.

1220
02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:11.000
Bullier into that conversation as a lawyer and try to get some happy medium between these two.

1221
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Does that sound okay?

1222
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:20.500
And since that's not a quorum of the subcommittee, that should be fine to do.

1223
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.500
Mr.

1224
02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.500
DeShayes of NHMA.

1225
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.500
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

1226
02:04:26.500 --> 02:05:17.500
So I do just want to, regarding the evidence, our biggest concern about requiring the evidence and how it would be defined would be developers or those who are property owners and the municipalities in court trying to determine what is actual empirical evidence what is a peer-reviewed source what kinds of it gets you get into a whole gray area where you'd be litigating on what you're even allowed to litigate okay and so that's some of our that's some of our biggest concerns with and i we understand the intent, but I do just want to flag that as that.

1227
02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:32.500
Well, and just so we're on the same page, we appreciate that you're helping with the technicalities of the language, but you are against the intent of the bill itself.

1228
02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.000
No, I understand, but I am pointing.

1229
02:05:36.000 --> 02:06:27.500
So just trying to, if the goal is to limit the amount of times that developers and municipalities are in court when you're trying to figure out what kind of information is going to be required for municipalities to report and they make these ordinance changes, I think that, I think it might end up being counterintuitive in some ways, but that's just, you know, just flagging that it might be, it might make more sense to get away from more of the what exactly is the information and having these more ambiguous terms that could be interpreted differently as case laws developed.

1230
02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:30.000
Thank you for your input.

1231
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
So just so we're clear, he's the lawyer.

1232
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.500
I have the degree in molecular biology.

1233
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:42.000
Empirical and quantitative and peer-reviewed are not disputable terms.

1234
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.500
They are very clear terms.

1235
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.500
They are well understood.

1236
02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:54.500
So I know that people outside the science community may be like, what does this mean?

1237
02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.500
But quantitative means numbers.

1238
02:06:56.500 --> 02:07:00.500
Empirical means real world as opposed to theory.

1239
02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:05.500
And peer-reviewed means literally you had peers repeat your process.

1240
02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:37.500
And so to my point, in the world of planning and zoning and small towns which we've got lots of we don't have good empirical evidence that adding a four-unit apartment building on a two-acre lot is either good or bad no the the town doesn't have to generate that evidence if they're going to somebody, they have to cite some evidence that exists.

1241
02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:40.500
They don't have to generate it.

1242
02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:43.000
And so that's my point.

1243
02:07:43.000 --> 02:08:01.500
And so we should give some guidance because I believe that the worst thing we can do is create a bill that creates a law that sends everybody to court for four years and nothing gets done.

1244
02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:10.500
And that would be worse than, you know, this is in the rule of don't make things worse.

1245
02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:13.000
And I don't want to.

1246
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:25.000
And I think the idea is a good, like I said, in the initial hearing, I think there's a lot of good in this.

1247
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
This is like a direction we should go.

1248
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.500
So now we're in the nasty part.

1249
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:36.500
Fill out the, you know, I'm an economist.

1250
02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:38.500
I have that degree.

1251
02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:45.500
And so we just assume the answer and then find facts that suit it.

1252
02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:48.000
That sounds right, Representative Belier.

1253
02:08:48.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I just, you know, in terms of, because I agree, quantitative empirical evidence, especially if it went to a peer-reviewed source, I mean to me that is great evidence if you're trying to prove something and you're going to court.

1254
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.500
So I think that is good evidence.

1255
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:39.000
I think that my bigger concern here is that when you have towns that are going to figure out how to grapple with this, if it passes as written, then you're going to have towns say, well, we need to commission a study and it needs to follow these standards and all this other stuff.

1256
02:09:39.000 --> 02:10:06.000
And what's going to happen is if we take this bill, I think, to the full house, we're going to have a lot of people who are going to be opposed to it because they're going to say, well, this is going to mandate my small town pay for a very, very expensive study.

1257
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:17.000
You know, so I think that's where this bill is going to get tripped up, even though I like show your work.

1258
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I like, you know, empirical evidence.

1259
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
It doesn't say that.

1260
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And why do you think that it would be read as that.

1261
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.500
Well, but no, I mean, that's a claim, unfunded mandate, right?

1262
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:40.500
But like it literally does, you can open a book and cite the evidence.

1263
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:44.000
You don't have to do the study.

1264
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.500
That's not the world that we live in in small towns.

1265
02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:53.000
They don't have to pass the ordinance.

1266
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
That's the thing.

1267
02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.500
It's not an unfunded mandate because they don't have to pass the ordinance.

1268
02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:09.500
You're going to, they're going to fight about it and they're going to sue each other.

1269
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:11.500
That's what thing.

1270
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:18.000
It's not an unfunded mandate because they don't have to pass the ordinance.

1271
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:26.000
You're going to they're going to fight about it and they're going to sue each other.

1272
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
That's what they're going to do.

1273
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:34.500
So, Mike, somebody said that the goal, maybe it was Mr.

1274
02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:40.000
Deshaies, if the goal is to not have people in court.

1275
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.000
My goal is to not restrict people's ability to live.

1276
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.500
The court thing is secondary to me.

1277
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:55.500
And while I am sympathetic, I care more about making sure people can live.

1278
02:11:55.500 --> 02:12:12.500
So I don't see why, I mean, it seems like we're spending a lot of time on this one sentence of quantitative empirical evidence, the best current scientific understanding by quantitative empirical peer reviewed.

1279
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:27.000
I mean, the other thing I'm thinking about is if, you know, the court got this and it says, okay, it's dictating what kind of evidence can be used.

1280
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:38.500
Would there be some kind of due process or constitutional challenge that the court would use to just strike down the language altogether?

1281
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:44.500
I mean I don't â€“ The language of the law you mean?

1282
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:52.000
The quantitative â€“ Quantitative evidence standard if there's â€“ I don't â€“ So â€“ Wait.

1283
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Sorry.

1284
02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I think we're going violent agreement but you know you the idea is we don't want the towns to come up with some bullshit reason on why you can't do something right you've got to have a so we all agree on Now we have to come out â€“ come up with a way that says in plain language that's supportable in court, anybody with an eighth grade education can read it and go, oh, I get it.

1285
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000
So â€“ That's where we're trying to â€“ that's the â€“ Right.

1286
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:52.500
And since we've spent 20 minutes on the first sentence, then I am going to hope that we can move on to the rest of the bill.

1287
02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:58.000
Is it in Representative Bowley or you had your hand up?

1288
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Was there a last thing to?

1289
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:37.000
The only last thing is, I mean, I don't know so much about like an eighth grade education, but I can tell you my intention was, you know, by by just calling out very clearly what the standard is and saying, look, if you're going to do health or safety and it is, you know, an extraordinary restriction, then it's, you know, it's either going to be strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny.

1290
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I think up to the committee to decide.

1291
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:49.500
Sounds like we're talking a lot about strict scrutiny, which is a higher standard, which is great.

1292
02:14:49.500 --> 02:15:04.000
I don't know if necessarily the town will know that, but any town council will definitely be able to tell them whether â€“ they'll give them a good idea.

1293
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:12.000
They'll give them a good legal opinion as to does this ordinance pass muster or not.

1294
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Right.

1295
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:21.500
And the more daunting the task is, the less likely they're going to try it.

1296
02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:43.000
But I think in terms of moving past, I think the spirit of this subcommittee and the spirit of the committee as a whole, and anybody's free to disagree with me, is to put the strictest scrutiny, strictest standard in general on this.

1297
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Like you absolutely have to show this is directly necessary, narrowly tailored, and least restrictive, which is the language in this thing.

1298
02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:13.000
So my suggestion, again, is that I get Bollier who as an attorney together with the other two attorneys who worked on this and merge those ideas together in the simplest version that still does what we want.

1299
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Cause I think we are in violent agreement about what we want to do.

1300
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Does that work if I get you together?

1301
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Yeah.

1302
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:35.000
And the only reason I in mind I used intermediate scrutiny was because it is a higher standard.

1303
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.500
And I think, you know, because I see Mr.

1304
02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:42.500
Deshaies over there like taking notes.

1305
02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:46.000
I think that taking his suspicious notes.

1306
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:52.500
But the fact but the fact is, is subjecting towns to strict scrutiny.

1307
02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:56.500
I mean, that is a pretty high burden.

1308
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:59.000
That's an extremely high burden.

1309
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:11.000
And I don't know if, you know, the full legislature would see this as, you know, okay, this is an attack on local control.

1310
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:28.500
I think that intermediate, I know we probably do water things down too much in this, in this committee, but it might be a way to say, look, we're not trying to override local control.

1311
02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:31.500
We're trying to strike a balance.

1312
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:37.500
And I'm going to bring you and the other two lawyers together.

1313
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:50.000
I'm going to let you all lawyerly duke it out in your lawyerly ways, and then we'll figure out the best for that one section.

1314
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000
We all good with yous doing that and moving on?

1315
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Okay, great.

1316
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:17.500
So the idea was that it would no longer get appealed to the ZBA, and so it would be going to superior court, which means that an aggrieved person under RSA 675 is no longer valid because that's the ZBA section.

1317
02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:25.500
So it would just be an aggrieved person whose property rights are affected by the ordinance.

1318
02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:27.500
Yes.

1319
02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:52.500
So I did take that out in mind, and the reason why is to give the ZBA a chance to listen to their town council and say, hey, before we go to Superior Court and there's an expensive lawsuit, you might want to have another chance to think about this.

1320
02:18:52.500 --> 02:19:34.000
And the way the rest of the RSA is written, it contemplates going going to the zba first so i don't think there's any harm in giving the zba a chance to reverse themselves and then go to superior court okay can we add that to the agenda for the lawyer meeting all right yes representative axel now that that's sort of what i wanted to say you know the intent of the z the ZBAs, you can always go to superior court.

1321
02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
This is America.

1322
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.500
You can always sue people.

1323
02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:50.000
But the intent of the ZBAs in New Hampshire and the way they function is to not have to go to superior court.

1324
02:19:50.000 --> 02:20:10.000
So if you have a disagreement or an issue at the planning board, rather than have to go through the expense and time of going to superior court, I have a cheap option, which is to go before the ZBA.

1325
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.000
And then I can appeal a decision of the ZBA.

1326
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:27.000
So I think you're making it harder for the poorer petitioner to get something changed if you remove that intermediate step of the ZBA.

1327
02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.500
That's a point well taken.

1328
02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:33.000
Again, I had the lawyers do this.

1329
02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
They did it.

1330
02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.500
They said, you know what?

1331
02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.000
Let's just do straight to Superior Court.

1332
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.000
So I'm just going to say all of paragraph one.

1333
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.500
We're going to fine tune because I think we're all in agreement in the spirit.

1334
02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:56.000
Is that good with everyone?

1335
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Okay.

1336
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Paragraph two.

1337
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
We're here.

1338
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:07.000
And I'm going to try to do side by side.

1339
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:20.000
For the purpose of this section, extraordinary restriction of residential property means any ordinance that restricts, regulates, or permits, property used, or proposed for residential purposes.

1340
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:27.500
I said, and that has, and you said, and that includes any of the following.

1341
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:31.000
So we'll just go line by line.

1342
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:38.000
It doesn't look like, I can't tell what you, if, if you changed anything.

1343
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Okay.

1344
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So really my only change was instead of limitation, I put restriction just so the wording was more consistent throughout the statute.

1345
02:21:51.000 --> 02:22:04.000
So I actually did that on a previous version of this Google doc and I don't know how it, so anyway, I did the same thing.

1346
02:22:04.000 --> 02:23:41.000
the same thing okay and then the only other thing was um um the uh the the fees one and then the um the camping one I really I like the spirit of that one my concern with those because I completely understand and I where you're where you're coming from on that and I think that is a good idea but I think that if people view this bill as something that's going to legalize you know people camping out on their property year-round or something like that I think we'll get a lot bigger fight on the floor and it'll get maybe some people who would vote for it actually against it because it'll take what really what this bill is about and it'll create this ancillary fight about you know camping and all that other stuff if this is something that i think we should revisit because i do think this is an issue um and it is a restriction on a residential use of property but i think that's maybe something where once we have this bucket established in the future add add these sort of things into the bucket.

1347
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So if I can, because we changed that piece to make it a little bit, they actually changed a few of these.

1348
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.000
So let me go back to this version with the two organizations.

1349
02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:50.000
The first one is any minimum square footage requirement for a dwelling or unit in excess of 200 square feet or the square footage required to meet the state building code whichever is greater i think the state building code for says 200 square feet which is why we lifted that lot size requirement over five acres per primary dwelling unit they added per primary dwelling unit um so you if you were to have the way it was written before it because it said per unit if you had a house with anU, then that would double your lot minimum until 10, right?

1350
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000
So this keeps it at five.

1351
02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:02.500
Then, because they were getting ambitious, the ones that are underlined, they are completely new and they added those.

1352
02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:19.000
For lots served by municipal water and sewer, and then they went on with frontage requirements over 50 feet, minimum square of greater than 50 by 50 feet for the plot, I presume.

1353
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:32.500
Minimum lot size of greater than 2,500 square feet or restrictions that, I mean, they really were like, let's see what we can get in this bucket.

1354
02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:43.000
Limitation on residential use of commercially zoned lots, which I think we're all in agreement on when just passed the bill.

1355
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:54.500
limitation on the in-home business use of commercially zoned lots, which I think we're all in agreement on when just passed the bill.

1356
02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:06.000
Limitation on the in-home business use of residentially zoned lots, provided such business use does not violate noise pollution, garbage, and light ordinances.

1357
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Do you think that covers what we need to cover?

1358
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Violate noise pollution.

1359
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Or, yeah.

1360
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000
All of those are anecdotes necessarily.

1361
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Right.

1362
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I didn't see the language about the surf, I was for water and suing.

1363
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
No, that's entirely new.

1364
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Bye, Al.

1365
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Adding too much.

1366
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Asking for too much.

1367
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:59.500
It was a wish list, and I just made sure to underline what they added because the colors weren't coming up in the black and white, so I was just underlining to make sure that you knew that that was the part that they were adding is entirely new.

1368
02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:22.500
Limitation on whether the dwelling unit is built on or off-site, which for some reason was included in the definition at the beginning in the previous version, local amendments, the state building code and, you know, stop me if I don't see your hand go up.

1369
02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:32.000
Let me local amendments to the state building code or state fire code regarding materials or methods of construction.

1370
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:43.500
That's where we get into things like Quonsets, 3D printed homes, manufactured homes, which impact residential buildings if not more than four units.

1371
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.500
Fees on variance.

1372
02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:50.000
I think that you kept that the same use.

1373
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Did you take it out entirely?

1374
02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Okay.

1375
02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:03.000
so the fee, like, okay, but I feel pretty strongly about some of the camping stuff.

1376
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:09.500
And I know that there's like a stigma thing, but let's just, okay.

1377
02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:38.500
So mine, if you flip over the page, changes it to like two different ones that one is the amount of time a property owner or authorized owner may camp on a property and a vehicle or other structure, provided that the ordinance may restrict the operation of a camping business that offers campsites in exchange for money.

1378
02:28:38.500 --> 02:29:44.000
And then same thing on the other one, the number of persons camping is they can have an ordinance that requires as long as it's not less than four per acre so you can say you can't have 10 people on an acre you can't have five people but you can't go under four um and also you can still restrict a camping business does that at all help that doesn't help your concern whatsoever no thank you so this is a non-starter for me and conquered just the campaign so i would i would um support representative bolio's um you know his version of not including this when we spoke previously your worries seemed to be around like homeless encampments but those people don't have legal access to those lands.

1379
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:59.500
This would create a potential situation where people would allow people to camp on their property indefinitely in somebody else's backyard, essentially, and the neighbor could not do anything about that.

1380
02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:04.500
Well, only if it's four or fewer people per acre.

1381
02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:09.500
Even in Troy, this is going to be an issue.

1382
02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:13.000
Okay, so let's start from the beginning.

1383
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.500
I feel it's very important.

1384
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:21.000
So how about if we just restrict it to the owner-occupier?

1385
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Why wouldn't the owner-occupier be able to camp?

1386
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Only the owner.

1387
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:35.500
If you are the owner of that land, then you're allowed to camp on your own land.

1388
02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:38.500
Why can't you do that now?

1389
02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:46.500
Because towns are literally saying you can't camp longer than three months on your own land.

1390
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:48.500
So, that's fine.

1391
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:50.500
Owner-occupier.

1392
02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:52.500
All right.

1393
02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:54.500
Owner.

1394
02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:56.500
Property owner.

1395
02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:58.500
The property owner, right.

1396
02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:05.000
You are the person camping and yours is the name on the deed.

1397
02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.500
Do we include, like, how do we say the family of that person?

1398
02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:18.000
Well, let's stick with this part first before we go to that part.

1399
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:28.000
So here's, as the devil's advocate here, so I'm a selectman, and you want to go camp on your land.

1400
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:34.000
And it's on a class six road, which currently is not buildable.

1401
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Not buildable.

1402
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
In my town.

1403
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Some towns it is.

1404
02:31:40.000 --> 02:33:32.000
and and so and you now decide you want to go camp out there semi-indefinitely and we have no way of restricting that due to lack of water sewer whatever else seems important and so if if the way i'm reading what or what we're saying here is if i pass a bill that says the owner property owner and their family can use the property for an unrestricted amount of time they could camp on the property for 15 years right so i think you're gonna have a problem with that i mean i mean that's what i want well i gather that's what i want but like yeah representative so to the point about you know health safety if we if you're going to get a building permit to build a home currently and i this is probably where you're going with this but if you don't have septic or well you're not gonna be able to build that home right right so the reason for that is likely health and safety right so the camping then some they might say you must have a well and septic right to camp and then if they could prove that that was necessary which they may very well may be able to do then they would be set to have that ordinance Thank you.

1405
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:38.500
might say you must have a whale and septic in order to camp.

1406
02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:53.000
And then if they could prove that that was necessary, which they may very well may be able to do, then they would be set to have that ordinance.

1407
02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:05.000
And that's the beautiful part of this concept is we, I think when we're getting into the items in the bucket, we're imagining bans.

1408
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.500
We're not banning the town from setting these ordinances.

1409
02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:15.500
We're just saying it's a higher threshold for these because it's extraordinary.

1410
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:27.500
I struggle with this because I deal with the reality of a small New England town that alternates between relative prosperity and occasional not.

1411
02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:42.000
And judgment has not been good judgment and zoning and common sense have not been the driving forces in the last 80 years in the towns in my region.

1412
02:34:42.000 --> 02:35:05.500
So, and I have, in my town right now, I can tell you as a selectman, we are engaged in trying to prevent a man who has created a health hazard, and he insists that he has the right to live on his camp on his property.

1413
02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:09.000
And there's no well, there's no septic.

1414
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.500
He's encroached on his neighbors.

1415
02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:54.000
I mean, I want to get you into the bottom line is it's not going to sell a p it's not going to sell well in alistad and actworth and troy and fitzwilliam it's not what we we don't need more people living in the woods i mean there's there's a couple aspects when we had the occupancy limit bill there were red flags going off when people started to talk weird about students and I'm having some of those same red flags go off.

1416
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.500
We don't like these people living in the woods.

1417
02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:01.500
They're weird kind of red flags.

1418
02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:09.000
And I want to separate that from the very real concern for health and safety.

1419
02:36:09.000 --> 02:37:10.500
If it is health and safety, if they are having like piles of feces build up, for example, if they're pouring like gallons upon gallons of soapy water or otherwise polluted water into your watershed for a sensitive stream or what have you that's a real concern and in that case they can set that ordinance they can say well you have to have a septic you have to have a well or you have to prove that you are you know having your stuff come and pumped, you have to have a septic, you have to have a well, or you have to prove that you are, you know, having your stuff come and pumped your, your whatever the, yeah, not septic.

1420
02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:12.500
Um, what's it called?

1421
02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:18.000
Like when you have a port-a-potty, they'll come and pump that.

1422
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Right.

1423
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:28.000
And yeah, whatever it is, you're, you prove that you have it, have it properly disposed.

1424
02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:38.000
So we could add owner-occupier and then in addition to that, add some verbiage around water and septic or yes.

1425
02:37:38.000 --> 02:38:46.500
So I was just going to say like if you own the property and you want to camp out and you are genuinely camping, you're not creating an or you know unsanitary situation but you're legitimately camping on your own property i mean new hampshire is a live free or die state i think you should probably be able to camp on your own property there's a lot of beautiful parts of new hampshire to camp on my problem my problem with and the reason i took it out in my first one is and we've already had it in the subcommittee, we'll have this problem in the committee and we'll have this problem in the full house, is that every additional thing that you put in this bucket is another reason for somebody to say no.

1426
02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:53.500
So I want to be very judicious with what we put in this bucket.

1427
02:38:53.500 --> 02:39:01.000
So that's why I'm saying that might be something to where I would love it.

1428
02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And there's a lot of things that I would love to say to us.

1429
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.500
I'm super passionate about the camping thing.

1430
02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:16.500
I'm super, because it is quickly becoming people's only option.

1431
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:31.500
So if we have to narrowly, narrowly define it, if we have to put in something around water and septic, I still would like to try to keep it in.

1432
02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.500
Yes.

1433
02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:35.500
Representative Plaxile.

1434
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:38.500
I'll be very straightforward about it.

1435
02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:49.500
I think it belongs in a separate bill so that all of the funky little details can be worked out about it.

1436
02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:54.000
And I won't vote for this with the camping.

1437
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
You will.

1438
02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.500
Are you saying you will not vote for it?

1439
02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.500
It has the camping in it at all.

1440
02:40:04.500 --> 02:41:23.500
Any any no matter how we have camping ordinances in most all of our towns and i'm sure they're all various i mean my town i think is fairly liberal you can apply to the selectmen i i have personally signed off on two permits for people to camp on their own property so in my town it's not a problem i understand it in the city of concord it may very well be a problem uh i think you're going to have only if each of those homeless people owned a piece of land i mean i and again i'm trying to be practical about it because there's a whole lot in this bill that i think is really helpful and good but i think i think this one is going to be i agree with representative bolio it's thing, and it's probably the hardest thing in here, and it has the most stigma attached to it.

1441
02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:34.500
And so the real politics part of this is put it in a separate bill and hash it out on its own.

1442
02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:45.000
Because it's going to drag this bill, if you think this bill is important, that's going to drag this bill down.

1443
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Representative Hicks.

1444
02:41:47.000 --> 02:42:21.000
So just, I have a 315 just oh sorry um i will so i generally agree with that i will support the bill if it's owner occupied um and it's limited to that i can justify that in concord okay okay but just to be very clear representative taxon no matter how it's worded, no matter how narrowly it's tailored, you won't support anything that talks about camping.

1445
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.500
You just asked me to define infinity.

1446
02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:28.000
Of course, I'm sure it's a combination.

1447
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.000
I don't get what you want to do.

1448
02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I don't know that I think it's an evil and bad thing that you've ever done.

1449
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.500
I think it's a mistake.

1450
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:44.500
Does that make sense?

1451
02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:46.500
Yes.

1452
02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.500
And I agree.

1453
02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:50.500
I agree with that.

1454
02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:52.500
I think that...

1455
02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:58.000
It's the riskiest piece of the bill is what we're saying.

1456
02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Yeah.

1457
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:08.500
And I think there's a lot of good in this bill that we could probably get passed.

1458
02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:10.500
Okay.

1459
02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:14.000
I agree that this may sink it.

1460
02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Okay.

1461
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:23.000
So the next two pieces are underlined and that is stuff that they added.

1462
02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.000
And this basically is repeating other bills that we had.

1463
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.000
The, well, one of them is saying, and it was a whole new concept.

1464
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:45.500
And what I'm, the temperature I'm taking, especially since we have a 315 stop is that we don't want to overcomplete.

1465
02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:54.000
We won't add more things to the bucket because the more we add, the worse it gets.

1466
02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:10.000
But just so you're aware of the concept, the concept is currently if someone were to build ADUs on their property, now they can't necessarily sell those ADUs as separate, like condo-wise.

1467
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:34.000
And the great thing about being able to sell it is the fact that then you have, if you You have one house with two ADUs, if you condoize it and sell the units, you have two extra property owners, homeowners, whereas before you only had one homeowner.

1468
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.500
So this was a concept.

1469
02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:49.000
It may be that if we get the bucket established this year, we can come back next year and add more things to the bucket.

1470
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:57.500
But I just wanted to make that concept, put it in your brains as a little seed.

1471
02:44:57.500 --> 02:45:05.500
The last one he added was the, it's basically the 457 bill, the occupancy limit bill.

1472
02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:13.000
So it was just kind of like putting, making that occupancy limit an extraordinary restriction.

1473
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.500
We can leave those out because I think that's what everybody's aiming for.

1474
02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:23.000
The rest of it is the appeals.

1475
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.500
Are we good on that?

1476
02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:33.500
Or because we already said we're going to talk about adding the zoning board back in.

1477
02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:35.500
Yeah.

1478
02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:52.000
So Representative Bollier and I are going to have a meeting with the other two lawyers and then we're going to hash out that piece of it, that kind of the court piece.

1479
02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:15.500
And then the very last piece I added is paragraph 11, just saying that any municipal ordinance that currently is an extraordinary restriction once this passes would have 90 days for them to offer that fact finding, which is another reason we might want the fact finding.

1480
02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:18.000
And then it becomes unenforceable.

1481
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:29.500
So if we presume all of that is the lawyer piece of it, then Representative Bollier and I will work on that separately.

1482
02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:40.000
Do you want to trust us to come up with the amendment or do you all want to have another subcommittee?

1483
02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.500
Okay, so just so you're, I can BCC everybody the amendment.

1484
02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:52.000
I can, we cannot discuss it on email because that's a notice meeting.

1485
02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:02.500
So one of the things I was thinking was maybe, you know, today they're on a different bill in this committee.

1486
02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:08.000
The subcommittee met at 9 o'clock just a little bit earlier.

1487
02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:23.000
So maybe if we do some more work on this, have a draft version BCC to everybody, and then we come ready to discuss that at like an earlier meeting.

1488
02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:33.000
And I think if there's broad, because it sounds like we're in agreement on the spirit and the sticking points.

1489
02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:48.500
I think if whatever, you know, that proposed language looks like if everybody's in agreement, then I think at nine o'clock subcommittee meeting, we could probably, you know, vote, vote it.

1490
02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:55.500
I think at 9 o'clock subcommittee meeting, we could probably, you know, vote it.

1491
02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:57.500
I think so.

1492
02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:04.500
I have to notice subcommittees before, like, I need 24 hours or 48 hours.

1493
02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:06.500
Yeah.

1494
02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:16.000
Or I could notice it for 945 and we could just take a vote and then we'll have something.

1495
02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Okay.

1496
02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
All right.

1497
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.500
You want to do that?

1498
02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:27.000
So next order of business is I'll grab Rep.

1499
02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Bollier.

1500
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:37.000
We'll hammer this out and then I'll notice another meeting and I'll send out the amendment.

1501
02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Yes?

1502
02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Yes.

1503
02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Thank you.

1504
02:48:43.000 --> 02:49:15.000
bullier will will hammer this out and then i'll notice another meetings and i'll send out the amendment yes yes what is this what are you trying to do with this hundred dollars because i can tell you i just like for various but being two properties that i own and i don't almost surrounding properties but i have that it cost me 35351.

1505
02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000
So I will be 100% honest.

1506
02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:36.500
The concept of this bill has been around, started in my head two years ago, and then I started getting a bunch of input from a bunch of different people who added a bunch of different things.

1507
02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:43.500
It could have come from the Honorable Josh O'Kella who helped me with this.

1508
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:51.500
It could have come from several different people, but I don't remember who put it in.

1509
02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.500
It actually wasn't me.

1510
02:49:53.500 --> 02:50:01.000
I am much more passionate about the camping thing than I am about any variants.

1511
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Okay.

1512
02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
All right.

1513
02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Okay.

1514
02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
All right.

1515
02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Well, that seems fine to me.

1516
02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
All right.

1517
02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Well, so we're not taking an official vote.

1518
02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
This is just what we're doing.

1519
02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:25.500
And I will be emailing everybody, especially you, soon.

1520
02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:29.000
And with that, we'll adjourn this subcommittee.

1521
02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:32.500
I will notice for the next one.

1522
02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:34.500
All right.

1523
02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:36.500
Thank you.

1524
02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:38.500
Thank you.

1525
02:50:38.500 --> 02:50:40.500
Thank you.

1526
02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:42.500
Thank you.

1527
02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:44.500
Thank you.
