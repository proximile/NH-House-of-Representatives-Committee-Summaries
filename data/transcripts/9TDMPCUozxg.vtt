New Hampshire Senate and I'm joining you

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
behalf of senator asharti this bill
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
makes a few changes to RSA 284 the
 
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
amended version of this bill removes a
 
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 align:start position:0%
language that would extend the 40-mile
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
simulcasting buffer to Historic horse
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
racing facilities and removes language
 
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
that would allow simulcasting at
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing facilities by
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
removing section one and making a
 
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 align:start position:0%
housekeeping change to section 3.
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill repeals the
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
requirement of needing 70 of employees
 
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
at a racing facility to be New Hampshire
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
residents with no live racing this is
 
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
residents with no live racing this is
unneeded

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
unneeded
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions but
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
please note I will need to defer
 
00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 align:start position:0%
responses to senator rashardi who I will
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
have follow-up I also believe the
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission may have
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
representation here today to take any
 
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 align:start position:0%
thank you you just opened yourselves up
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
representative Platt has his hand up
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
yeah you won a 78 RPM and I type it 34
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
RPM do you have that what you gave
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
written please absolutely yes sorry
 
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that was hard for me too
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
to even get all the elements
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
um representative only yes I kind of uh
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
blocked it the first one did you say
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
removes a buffer
 
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
yes so the amended version removes the
 
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 align:start position:0%
language that would extend the 40 mile
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
simulcasting buffer to Historic horse
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I do not have the bill in front of me
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
but I can have Senator ricciardi follow
 
00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.969 align:start position:0%
but I can have Senator ricciardi follow
up

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
but you're saying as amended it removed
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
that is that what you're saying so the
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
amended version does remove that
 
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
amended version does remove that
language

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
could you would you
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
since we all seem to have a lot of
 
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
questions could you go over that one
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
more time yes it's a little bit slow
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
more slowly so we understand all the
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
elements thank you and then we'll do
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
questions is it representative just a
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
quick clarification I believe that
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
what she's saying is that she's giving a
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
list of the changes the amended bill
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
made to the bill as introduced and so
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
that section for example on
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
the 40 mile perimeters
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
is not in this
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
because it was deleted in the amendment
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you right so you are yeah if you
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
could just read that more slowly so we
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
understand your the amended version does
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
what thank you so this bill is making a
 
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
few representative Ami yeah do you have
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
something that tells us what's in the in
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended I'm sure I can have
 
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
we do have the amended Bill though right
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have their explanation of it
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh of the parts that weren't amended
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay well we're not going to overly
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
Grill you but we would love to hear what
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
you have to say just a little more
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
Maya go ahead and just one more time so
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
we can hear you better yes
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
um so this bill makes a few changes to
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 284.
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the amended version of this bill removes
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
the language that would extend the
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
40-mile simulcasting buffer to Historic
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
horse racing facilities
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
it also removes language that would
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
allow similar casting at historic horse
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
racing facilities by removing section
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
one and it makes a housekeeping change
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
does that make sense okay thank you very
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
much what was section one that it
 
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
much what was section one that it
removed

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay you know what she's here on behalf
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
of the senator and why don't we uh give
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
her a break if you any questions that
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
you have I'm going to go back and write
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
them down for Senator ricciardi so I can
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone's um you know
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
inquiries are followed up with thank you
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
so much yeah we'll we'll get some more
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
testimony from other folks but thank you
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and thank you for
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
representing representing the center
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions you can ask her
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding the background checks which
 
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.650 align:start position:0%
um regarding the background checks which
uh

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.949 align:start position:0%
uh
um

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
would take place if you're allowing the
 
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.310 align:start position:0%
would take place if you're allowing the
interstate

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
um employees
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
do the in perhaps the commissioner can
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
answer this at some time do the
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
background checks include
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh a Nick's check or is it just a New
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire check because the New
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire check is only New Hampshire so
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you've got a person residing another
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
state they don't really
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
fall into the system this is something
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
that shows up with
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
um for example a sexual predators below
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
often move from state to state to state
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
to avoid that because most background
 
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:17.660 align:start position:0%
checks are only the state of residence
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is the 100 percent
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
odd sense of the breakage coming across
 
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.310 align:start position:0%
odd sense of the breakage coming across
um

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
is this in addition to the general fund
 
00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
is this in addition to the general fund
Monies

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
Monies
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
that would go into the the gambling and
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
treat uh treatment to fund
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
or is this the solely fund that that
 
00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.650 align:start position:0%
or is this the solely fund that that
area

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
another question for Senator
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
yes on I am producing an amendment which
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
would put the breakage into a dedicated
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
fund because I looked in the dedicated
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
funds book and there is nothing under
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
Lottery that uh is a problem gaming fund
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I I would like to know if that's any
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
kind of a problem for them
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
the commit the executive director
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much okay so uh
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
next up we have Rick Newman uh Lakes
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair and members of the
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing me I'll
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
be very brief I hope
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
um my name is Rick Newman and I am here
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Lakes Region Casino which
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
is one of two facilities in New
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are eligible to have
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
simulcast racing they don't have it
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
right now the brook is the only one that
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
does have it but under our current law
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh Belmont also is eligible
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking just I think there are
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences with this bill
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
relative to the breakage section uh when
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
we were in the Senate
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was brought up I think by Lottery
 
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380 align:start position:0%
actually that the language May
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
adversely impact some historic horse
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
racing uh manufacturers I was not aware
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
of that at that time it's come to my
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
attention that that is potentially a
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
problem so I I would recommend that the
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%
bill be retained I think it is basically
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
a technical Corrections bill I don't
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
think there are any earth-shattering
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
provisions in it and nothing that
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't be put off for the six months
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
that retaining it would do one thing I
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
would like to point out I think it was I
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
forget who brought it up perhaps
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey but
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um currently for instance the brook
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
keeps 50 percent of breakage this bill
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
would change that so they keep none of
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
it it would all go to to the state in
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
some form that of course would apply to
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region Casino where they too get
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
into go back to simulcasting which I
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
think is a disincentive there isn't a
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
lot of money not a lot of profit in
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
simulcasting and uh having uh taking
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
away this one incentive that might
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
encourage them at one point or another
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
to go back into the business I think is
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
a is not necessarily a good move so I
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
think that whole section on the breakage
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
issue itself needs to be carefully
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
looked at to make sure we're not doing
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
something that we didn't intend to do
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you could you just point out which
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
section so we can find sure um so if you
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
look at the bill
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
talking about uh
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
it really begins in
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill
 
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:08.449 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill
uh

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
and it also continues into section two
 
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.910 align:start position:0%
and it also continues into section two
those

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
in section three those three sections uh
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
address changes to the language that
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
that governs what breakage is and how
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out one one quick thing
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
for you if you if you look at it right
 
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.850 align:start position:0%
for you if you if you look at it right
now

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
the language that defines what breakage
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
is look at page
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
uh one line
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
or 17.
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
so right now under the current law the
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
language says
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh based on each dollar wagered this
 
00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:54.350 align:start position:0%
uh based on each dollar wagered this
bill

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh changes that to say
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
of each wager apparently there may be
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequence to that
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
language I'm not clear exactly what it
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
is I'm simply saying I think it's
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
something we should be looking at a
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
little more carefully which is why I
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
for some reason when I read this I was
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
focused on the employee state residency
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
thing can you talk to that I don't know
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
what what is that yeah so that's what's
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
really a throwback to the days of live
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
racing um when uh I I think that may
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
have been put in when dog racing was
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
approved at Seabrook and uh you know the
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to make sure that New
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents got priority at
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
those jobs and so there were a lot of
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
those jobs where people that worked in
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
the paddock and you know stewards and
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things and of course we
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't have any live racing in New
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now and I can't say there
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
never will be but I doubt very much if
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
someone is going to do the expense of
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
building a track to have live racing
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere so it really is something that
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
would you be open to other questions
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
mine three of Page Three uh right after
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
that on
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
why are we repealing the requirement for
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
annual financial statements
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh so that
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
financial statement again it the current
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
law refers to a racing plant I believe
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
it is and again I think that's uh
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
really was intended to be alive live
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
racing it's it was never it's not clear
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
that it so again it's a redundant
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
statute that doesn't need to be there
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
microphone please I'm sorry thank you
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
you brought up the um issue with
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
breakage and unintended consequences so
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you how I read this
 
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
part and see if this is matches what
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
your concern was that the current
 
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.049 align:start position:0%
your concern was that the current
language

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
and breakage is the the pennies the
 
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.549 align:start position:0%
and breakage is the the pennies the
difference

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um the second decimal when you look at
 
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
an amount of money so it's it's the you
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
know it's not 10 it's like one through
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
nine on the end so
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the way it's written now
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
if there's a bet of ten dollars
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the payout or whatever you want to
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
call that is
 
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
like 1.2 dollars in nine cents
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
that right now you take that nine cents
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
and you'd it would be times ten because
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
the wager was ten dollars so that would
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
be 90 cents and if the way it's worded
 
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.190 align:start position:0%
be 90 cents and if the way it's worded
now

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say per dollar it's per wager
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
so that ten dollar wager would deliver
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it was you know um ten dollars
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
and 90 cents in which case there's no
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
breakage is that the way you're looking
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
as I understand I mean breakage today
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
the way it's the way the law is written
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
now in your example if once we've
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
distributed the winnings to all of the
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
winners if it comes to two dollars and
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
nine cents each winner would get two
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
dollars nine cents is breakage that goes
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
into the breakage money which is then
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
distributed currently half is cut by the
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
state half by the uh facility
 
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.210 align:start position:0%
state half by the uh facility
um

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
I really can't answer the question you
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
specifically asked but I think that is
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
another reason why I think maybe the
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill should be retained
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
all right we'll just keep going around
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
this side I see a hand up yes
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative Jordan ulery
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair what which
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative helps brings up a
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
interesting question
 
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.070 align:start position:0%
interesting question
um

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
in here it just says which is breakwood
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
which is called breakage
 
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:26.390 align:start position:0%
which is called breakage
uh

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:28.700 align:start position:0%
the redistribution of each wage
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
exceeding some equal to the next lowest
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
multiple of 10 is known as breakage now
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
it's not 10 cents but it's 10 so if if
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
you were payout 10.90
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
you would pay out the uh
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
it does not now it does not now it does
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
not know
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
then please explain to us how breakage
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
Works currently so that we all have the
 
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.890 align:start position:0%
Works currently so that we all have the
same

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
starting point
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
well I hope I can but um if you if the
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
if if after we have money in a prize
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
pool Lloyd paramutual wagering Works
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
money goes into a pull
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay so we have X dollars in the in the
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
wind pool okay okay then we have a
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
certain number of people who have the
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
winning ticket
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay that those number of winners is
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
divided by the number of money into the
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
winpool and that money is distributed to
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
or that's what they call the
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
redistribution that's distributed to the
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
winners if that calculation comes to
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
something other than the dime if it
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
comes to three dollars and
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
11 cents per person each of those people
 
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
get 310 and the penny is the breakage if
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
it comes to 330 per person each of those
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
people get 330 and there would be no
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay so it's to the it's to the 10th
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
decimal parts to the decimal not to the
 
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.710 align:start position:0%
decimal parts to the decimal not to the
dollar

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.450 align:start position:0%
dollar
correct

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
second that second does representative
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
all me
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
I was just going to suggest that we
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
ought to discuss these things with
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
Valerie King
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
I don't have any pink cards from our
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
friends from New Hampshire lottery but
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll be willing to educate
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
us later today uh any questions on this
 
00:22:38.409 --> 00:22:38.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow and how much does uh
 
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:43.010 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow and how much does uh
just

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
so we have some idea you say it's 50 50
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
currently what does that account to the
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
state how much to the uh game operator
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it's about seventy thousand
 
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.090 align:start position:0%
um I think it's about seventy thousand
dollars

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.100 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's about seventy thousand dip if you
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes the state would I
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
believe receive
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand more dollars than they
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
do today
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
less dollars than they do today Lottery
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
would increase by 105. yeah lottery so
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
if you include Lottery if you so the
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
right now the the brook in La last year
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
the brook received approximately seventy
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or cap seventy thousand
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in breakage
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
that would now go to the lottery and
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
follow up one more on his
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up on your comment regarding
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
incentive to in your case uh Lakes
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
Region six region Casino
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
um not seventy thousand dollars is not a
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
small sum for the types of operations we
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
have in this state is that correct
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's a significant
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money there is not a lot of
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I should
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
probably mention that I am in this
 
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.289 align:start position:0%
probably mention that I am in this
industry

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if I'm impacted by this
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill but I am in this industry okay we
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
also have a card from Peter Bragdon
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
representing Churchill drown Churchill
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
virtual trout
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
welcome back Senator thank you madam
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
record Peter bragden a senior policy
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
advisor with pretty strategies uh here
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
today representing Churchill Downs uh
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs in addition to owning
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
the Chasers Poker Room in Salem also uh
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
owns and operates Gaming facilities in
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
10 states and have been involved with
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the design of historic racing machines
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
used across the country and due to some
 
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
recent acquisitions is now in the
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
business of manufacturing such machines
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
and really have no uh objections to any
 
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
of the the bill in in the grand scheme
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
of the intent of the bill but have some
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
some specific concerns uh with one piece
 
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:00.740 align:start position:0%
of the bill that would be on page two
 
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:04.580 align:start position:0%
uh section three which starts on line 25
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
and this kind of piggybacks on with the
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
discussion you folks were having about
 
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.250 align:start position:0%
discussion you folks were having about
breakage

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
breakage
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
with the historic racing machines
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
breakage Works in a similar way although
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not split with the
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
machines 100 of the breakage goes uh for
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
problem gaming none of it is retained by
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
The Operators uh the concern that's been
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
expressed to me by my client and uh I
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand the details but
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
based on how this is written in this
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
case changing the redistribution based
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
on each dollar wagered to be
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
redistribution based on each wager uh
 
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
the machines are not programmed uh or
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
their Hardware is not set in such a way
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
as it can compute that it works the way
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
it is now but there's some concern that
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
by changing this language has the
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of making it so that they
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
can't compute that value we have no
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
objection to paying the breakage
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and it's really on a matter of time
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
we calculate it with the technology that
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
we currently have in the machines that
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
are in operation I do think sometime
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
would lend itself to resolving this
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
issue and would request that the bill
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
either be retained or some work sessions
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
on it and there are some options there
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh either keeping the status quo
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
language or even if it was you know some
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
percentage some calculation in statute
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
that said this is what breakage should
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
be that would be fine too so it's not an
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
objection to paying the breakage it's
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
more of objection to the machines may
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
not be able to calculate the breakage if
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
this particular change is made
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh Rosa only
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
of each wager means and so could you
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
walk us through it
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't really although as it was
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
explained to me at least with some of
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
the machines out there a person puts a
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
wager in let's say let's say a dollar
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
just for round numbers and I don't know
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
if that's realistic or not
 
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.690 align:start position:0%
if that's realistic or not
um

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:07.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
that is broken up between actually three
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
separate races that are run and so now
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's no longer one bet it's three
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
separate bets
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
um and so under the way the law
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
currently stands it can be calculated
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
based on that one bet but internally
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's broken down into three separate
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
bets and my understanding is the
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
machines don't have the ability once
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
that money is fed in the slot to
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
determine what the actual breakage is at
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
that granular level
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
put across three races so that's and I
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
have a minor in mathematics and a major
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
in computer science so I assume somebody
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
could explain it to me so I got it but
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
it had something to do with the fact
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
that you're on some machines it's
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
actually spread across three races at a
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
time so that's the best I can do uh
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you follow up follow up
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
so you mean that the person has actually
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
bet on three different
 
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
races or horses within the internals of
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
the machine I believe that is actually
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay we'll start on this side and go
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
around the room representative Phyllis
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
just a technical follow-up So when you
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
say three races is that win place and
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
show or is it no I have a very easy
 
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:33.610 align:start position:0%
answer for that I don't know
 
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:38.930 align:start position:0%
answer for that I don't know
[Laughter]

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
time no okay working around any
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
questions on this side of the room yes
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury thank you madam
 
00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:47.930 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury thank you madam
chair

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the primary purpose here
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
is to change the allocation the
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
distribution and I'm wondering
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
if all of the changes let's let's take
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
the first example where it comes up on
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
lines 16 through 23.
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
if all of the changes in language there
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
were kept
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
but only the change
 
00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
from based on each dollar wagered to of
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
each waiver if that was removed and
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
everything else was left intact
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I'm not
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
sure all the other sections where this
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
appears relates to the simulcast and
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to any historic racing
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
machines which is my area of Interest so
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how it would affect those
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh to be honest okay but that is
 
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.860 align:start position:0%
essentially what's repeated four times
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
during page one and two that is correct
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay and uh Valerie King and or Charlie
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
McIntyre have also filled out a pink
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
card hopefully they can help explain
 
00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:10.070 align:start position:0%
card hopefully they can help explain
breakage

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
breakage
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Valerie King I
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
oversee the enforcement and compliance
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
division over at New Hampshire Lottery
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh Charlie McIntyre directory would you
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
be able to explain breakage in a way
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
that we could maybe understand it sorry
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's me
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
um actually Rick did a good job of it
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
it's when you have when when the payout
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
has an extra uh pennies it doesn't round
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
out to a dime so if like Rick said if
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's three dollars and 11 cents that
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
penny is breakage and it goes into a
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
separate pool a separate
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
piggy bank
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee for
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lottery yes representative
 
00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:10.669 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lottery yes representative
Phillips

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you so my take of this that
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought the breakage was
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just working on the
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
calculation because I know math I don't
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
know gambling
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
um that if you were to make your bet if
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to calculate that
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
breakage for each dollar of the bet that
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
was made and you're going to calculate
 
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
it on the total for the BET every time
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
the bet is
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
ten dollars
 
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.380 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get any breakage
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
Therefore your revenue is going to be
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
significantly lower from that breakage
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the issue is
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
The Wager may be less than a dollar
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so when it's less than a dollar
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
there would be no breakage but when it's
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
more than a dollar there would be
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
breakage so in this case you're changing
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
it so now it's any wager before it was
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
it has to be a dollar or more now it can
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
be any wager which means that 10 cent
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
wager that you put on a historic horse
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm not understanding why is is a
 
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:31.700 align:start position:0%
dollar the largest wager you can make
 
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.230 align:start position:0%
dollar the largest wager you can make
no

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
it can be less on a historic horse
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
racing machine it can be less
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
it can be more it can be less
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
so if the wager is
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
ten dollars
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
it then there is no breakage
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
no it depends on the amount of the wind
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
not the amount of the bet for breakage
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
all right I understand that but the
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
basic when the when the amount
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
per dot currently the amount per dollar
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
for a win is
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
is a number that's one dollar rounded to
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
do well it's rounded to two decimals
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
if that's correct when your 10 when you
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
have a ten dollar bet that second
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
decimal is always going to be zero but
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not what happens so if
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's not how it is tell me I think
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
you're mixing two things this is saying
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
that you you wouldn't even calculate
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
breakage if the if the wager that you
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
wagered was less than a dollar currently
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
if it's less than a dollar there's
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
there's no breakage calculation if it's
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
more than a dollar wager then breakage
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
does apply
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about the penny part
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's talking about when when breakage
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna keep going around the
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
room representative Southworth I thank
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so to follow
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
up what is the advantage of the change
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the business and the
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
state or the Lottery Commission there
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
must be an advantage I think the
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
ultimate Advantage I think of the
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
question representative was to increase
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
the funding for problem gaming
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
um which not just increases the funding
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
but also this has to apply to the budget
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
as well annually there's a quarter
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars applied to problem
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
gambling out of our budget and this
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
would be the one of the revenue sources
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I just want to clarify something you
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
just said because representative only
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
had a question so you already have 250
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
000 in a problem gaming fund is it a
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm taking the question Madam chair it's
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
a the council is administratively
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
attached to us which has a very specific
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
definition under the law we don't
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
oversee them they are an independent
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
body that is a okay administratively
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
tied to us we assist them in matters of
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
procurement finances
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
um we they use our facilities for their
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
meetings that kind of thing so but also
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
they receive 250 000 which they are
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
independently responsible for
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative did you
 
00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:15.470 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative did you
wanna

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:17.579 align:start position:0%
I think we're on a different tact right
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
now but on the Council of problem gaming
 
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:25.820 align:start position:0%
on doesn't have a dedicated fund if it's
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
administratively attached because I was
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the dedicated fund book and
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's not named no it's literally
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
contained within our budget as an
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
expense essentially the lottery
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
essentially the lottery right and
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
there's no
um

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:51.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
there's they don't have to use governor
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
and Council
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
which we've run into with another bill
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
that uh fish and game has to go to
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for all of the
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
money of the endangered species
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
fund because it's not a dedicated fund
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
yet so they're becoming a dedicated fund
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer that question
 
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.270 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer that question
yeah

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative Jordan ulery
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
commissioner

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
being administratively attached to the
 
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.390 align:start position:0%
being administratively attached to the
lottery

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
that means that you have to take from
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
your budget X number of dollars to for
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
that entity
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
if this money were to go into let's say
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
we set up a dedicated fund which would
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
reduce your budget by x amount
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh which would go in whatever we put
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
into that the question then comes as to
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
how much you're now spending for problem
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
gaming via the commission
 
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.170 align:start position:0%
gaming via the commission
and

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
would this generate more or less
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
than that amount
 
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.890 align:start position:0%
than that amount
and

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
what a cap on receipt of this amount
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
meet both the the incentive
 
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.210 align:start position:0%
meet both the the incentive
um

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
portion of this as well as provide uh
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-general fund funding for the
 
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
non-general fund funding for the
commission

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay I understand your question you're
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
asking regarding the funds and the
 
00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:30.859 align:start position:0%
Council on the commission
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
historically the legislature is assigned
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
us tasks to do and made us pay for it
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
um this is no different and so this is
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
literally an expense of ours that comes
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
out of our existing operating budget If
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
This Were to pass then this funds the
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
additional funds would
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
supplant money we currently expend and
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
then the supplanted funds would then
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
drop to the bottom line is return to
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
education profit because that's in terms
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution it's very simple
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
revenues minus expenses equals return
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
education so and honestly thirty five
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on what this year will
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
be 180 million dollars in profit is a
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.930 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay that didn't answer the other
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
question about putting a cap on the
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
amount of funds to go back to the game
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
operator as an incentive to continue to
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
operate the game oh I understand
 
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.530 align:start position:0%
operate the game oh I understand
um

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
that's one for the operators in terms of
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
what you would assess them is is it
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
incentive obviously
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
there were two facilities that had a
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
right to have simulcast one was in
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale one Still Remains in Belmont
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
obviously when Hinsdale doesn't operate
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
anymore so that would give you
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
indication of of its
 
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.370 align:start position:0%
indication of of its
profitability

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
um why don't I go this way and we'll go
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
back around represent a plat
 
00:38:54.839 --> 00:38:56.329 align:start position:0%
back around represent a plat
yes

00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:56.339 --> 00:38:57.010 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear to understand
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
the argument by Rick Newman doesn't want
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
to pay when it comes to keep 50 instead
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
of 100 I understand that and you're
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
disagreeing because you need the money
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
no no it's we this wasn't our bill we
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
didn't okay no this wasn't not disagree
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative yeah okay do you
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
understand Peter bragan's point about
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
not being able to calculate you and to
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
get into weeds enough to understand
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
where they have trouble with that
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
um so the the question because this is
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
relates to simulcast yeah I think he was
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
conflating that with historic horse
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
racing machines which has a separate
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
breakage calculation as I understand it
 
00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:38.569 align:start position:0%
breakage calculation as I understand it
okay

00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
so so the HHR is a problem for them
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
they're not simultaneous so the language
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
specific to breakage in this
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
Bill relates to simulcast breakage which
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
is different than breakage on a historic
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
horse racing machine okay
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
unless there's some connection that I'm
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
not aware of they're two different laws
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay keep going around this side yes
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the fiscal note and
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting their papers out
 
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.849 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting their papers out
um

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
the indication here is that there would
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
be a seventy thousand dollar annual
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
decrease in the general fund and 105 000
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
increase going to the lottery but on the
 
00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:34.339 align:start position:0%
funding source it says general education
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering what that education
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative it's essentially because
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
our funding is education that's why
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's checked all right so it would not
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
be coming out of no no no what the
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
opposite okay thank you thank you madam
 
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.390 align:start position:0%
opposite okay thank you thank you madam
chair

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay we're working around the room
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
anything over here
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask the commissioner if
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
you if we look at the total
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
pot there are two parts related to
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
breakage one is how you're going to
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
split up the money for breakage and the
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
other one is how you're going to
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
calculate breakage differently so let's
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
just talk about just calculating it
 
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.670 align:start position:0%
just talk about just calculating it
differently

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it says in the fiscal note
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the total amount
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
for breakage from
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
2022 calendar year was a hundred and
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
so if we calculate
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
breakage differently
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that will affect what the
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
total amount is going to be of course
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's not going to be 140
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
again but you know does that have any
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
so my guess is probably not only because
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
most simulcast Wagers are more than a
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
dollar so the the change from any wage
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
or two
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
um any uh wager of a dollar or more
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
so get back to my original question that
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
I asked you I asked you about the
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
difference I asked you about when a
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
wager was ten dollars and you didn't
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
respond to that you just told me about
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
wages less than a dollar
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
so do how do you tell me what the
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
breakage looks like on a wager of ten
 
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
dollars versus the way we calculate it
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
now on one dollar and then time you know
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
as if it were 10 Wagers
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
um so yes so that's your question ten
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
dollars would just be a multiple of one
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
in that case and would
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
award you 10 times more than if one
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
person had been a dollar of that
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
available prize pool so that would be
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
so if there was
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
if on if on the one dollar wager the
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
return was a dollar and nine cents
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
yes then you have nine cents of breakage
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
correct and if it's if you're going to
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
calculate the breakage on the amount of
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
the wager which is my reading of this
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
bill a ten dollar wager would be
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
ten dollars and ninety cents not correct
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
and no breakage
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure when you make a wager
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's all depending upon how many other
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
people made Wagers and so you can't
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
calculate the breakage based on a
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
individual weight what is it
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
breakages from the winnings and so when
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
you place a wager and you win if you and
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
it might make it easier to know the
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
history that in the old days when the
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
window people had to pay out your wager
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to deal with the
 
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.690 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to deal with the
pennies

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
pennies
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't pay you the pennies
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
they they'd leave that behind and all
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
that extra money went into a separate
 
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.890 align:start position:0%
that extra money went into a separate
pot

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
pot
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
but what so what is a wager do are we
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
just how much you bet ten ten dollars
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
ten dollars is your wager but it it does
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily cut you don't make a
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
calculation of breakage on the wager
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill says to do you
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
know what it's saying is when the wager
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
is less than a dollar
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
then they don't we don't get any partial
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
did you do you have a question
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
yeah okay follow up on what
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
the was just said by represented fellows
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a difference and you pointed it
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
out there's a difference between wager
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
which is the money I give
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
and winnings which is the money
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
the operator gives
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
the breakage is based upon what the
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
operator gives
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not based on the wager
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
right it's based on the winnings right
 
00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:31.819 align:start position:0%
so the award wager in here changes that
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
based on the amount of money I give
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
so if we change it to winnings now we're
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
talking about how much money is coming
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
back to me is that what you were trying
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I like the way you put it uh folks
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking this would be nice because
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of folks here for the next
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
bill that maybe we do a work session on
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
this if you'd be open to joining us so
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
we can better understand it that be yes
 
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.290 align:start position:0%
we can better understand it that be yes
representative

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes I think also we ought to pursue the
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
senator and find out why she wanted to
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
change the language of it of each wave
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
to of each wager well she happens to be
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
my Senator so I will happily reach out
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay I do not have any more ping cards
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 112 is there anyone else
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
yes it was confusing okay moving right
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
along we will now open up the public
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill more stuff
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 104.
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
FNA and for the record I am involved in
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
this industry I have some things coming
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
around here hold on did you get a copy
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
I just did not okay
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
yeah please give us a moment while we
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay let's try to do this hi welcome
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.609 align:start position:0%
okay let's try to do this hi welcome
back

00:47:57.609 --> 00:47:57.619 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Senator Tim Lang to
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 104. thank you
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you members of the
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Senator Tim Lang I
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
represent District 2 which is if I go
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
back to my old New Jersey days it's
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
exit 20 to Exit 29 on the east side of
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
the interstate
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
um is my General District
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
um I I'm presenting you uh how a Senate
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 104
 
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.170 align:start position:0%
Bill 104
um

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
so many of you know I I'm the chair of
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate Ways and Means Committee in
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
addition I've served three terms on in
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
the house and on this committee
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so charitable gaming is something I'm
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
fairly familiar with however the
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about this bill is
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
that I came at it backwards
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
so I didn't come in because I wanted to
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
legalize online gaming I came in because
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
I wanted to provide a solution to our
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
Workforce problem
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and using our community college system
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
as a way to get there however I'm a
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
pragmatic person and I won't present a
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill that's going to have a cost unless
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
I know where that cost is coming from
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
as we all know that the budget's
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
strained as it is where we choose to
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
spend our money so I came up with a new
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream using online gaming to be
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
able to help solve some of our Workforce
 
00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:07.430 align:start position:0%
able to help solve some of our Workforce
issues

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll talk first about the online
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
gaming so the online gaming piece is
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
just simply that it allows for eye
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
gaming only table games so no electronic
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
games no HHR no Lucky Seven none of
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
those games that we allow in the brick
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
and mortar uh component it allows
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
strictly poker Blackjack roulette those
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
kind of games to be able to play online
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I look at this
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill as as a good bill is in in that
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
environment the online game you can go
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
right now to bovada.lv which is based
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
out of Costa Rica put money into your
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
account and start playing poker however
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you win there is no obligation and no
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
mechanism for you to actually get your
 
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.130 align:start position:0%
mechanism for you to actually get your
money

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is you have no
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protections you can't exactly
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
go to the attorney general and say hey I
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
was illegally playing poker out of a
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
site out of Costa Rica and I won the
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
jackpot and they're refusing to pay me
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
you have no no mechanism to do that
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever because you have to be
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
admitting to a crime in the state of New
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you did that and so the
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
bill bill allows forced consumer
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
protections it protects our citizens who
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
choose to pay play online poker or
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
online blackjack or online roulette
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
those type of table games who choose to
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
play make their choice so that's where
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
they want to spend their money and it
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
gives them some consumer protections to
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to be able to deal with the
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
fact that an illegal operator is in the
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
state and it gives you them the ability
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
to go to the attorney general and say
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is an illegal operator playing in
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
our state that shouldn't be playing and
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
gives the Attorney General the ability
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
to prosecute and go after them so for
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
breaking New Hampshire law which is that
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
you have to be an authorized agent to
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
play online poker authorized by the
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
state so so consumer protection was a
 
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:50.300 align:start position:0%
big part of this bill
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
the bill was amended in the in the
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
Senate twice the first part because they
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
completely forgot OLS in a drafting
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
error completely forgot to put the RFP
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
process in the bill on how we'll select
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
our vendors and how Lottery will do that
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the first amendment in the ways of
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
Means Committee in the Senate was to add
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
that RFP process back in that literally
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
it was a cut and paste error and fixed
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
that the second part has to do with the
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
community college scholarship fund
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so when I talk so we have the online
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
gaming consumer protections and that's
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm authorizing people are doing
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
this already we saw with sports betting
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
um you know which I was the Prime
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
sponsor of as well to allow online
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
sports betting and in-person sports
 
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.230 align:start position:0%
sports betting and in-person sports
betting

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
betting
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
um that generated 67 or now I think it's
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
over 70 million dollars to education
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
since that bill was passed in 2019. so
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
online services allow for an opportunity
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
for us to to create revenue on a
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis nobody's forced to do
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
either sports betting and they'll be
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
forced to do online gaming create a
 
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
revenue stream to fix our Workforce
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
problem so I'm going to step into the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
workforce problem now I think we've all
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
seen that New Hampshire has a
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
significant Workforce issue in that go
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
try to find an electrician a plumber a
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
carpenter go go to a hospital and ask
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
them what their needs are for nurses
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
phlebotomists Radiology techs every one
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
of those jobs I just cited let's do one
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
more let's go to the education and look
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
at early childhood development special
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
education right again all of those jobs
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned can be provided by the
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
community college system at a faster
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
rate than a four-year college so instead
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
of waiting four years for a student to
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
step out of as K-12 go into college and
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
come back out instead of waiting four
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
years we move the workforce up by two
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
years by providing funding one of the
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
one of the titles I give this bill is
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
the jobs the careers bill so my goal is
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
to take people who are in part-time
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
low-income jobs who may have a financial
 
00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:47.660 align:start position:0%
burden at the financial
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
barrier to getting an education and
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
provide a funding mechanism so this bill
 
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
not only supports credited courses but
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
uncredited courses so the community
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
college system has a great coders boot
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
camp for cyber security and it would
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
allow while some grants like I believe
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
the Pell Grant doesn't support those
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
kind of programs because it has to be
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
accredited program that gets actual
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
college credits towards a degree this
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
program would allow for those certified
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
certification programs that are
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
available in our community college
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
system so even if you're not leading to
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
an associate's degree but you're leading
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
to get a career certification enter into
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
a degree you could use the funding from
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
the community college scholarship on
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
that's created by this bill to be able
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
to support that in the nursing industry
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
you look at there are some significant
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
lab fees for some of those jobs when you
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
take those courses and some of those
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
fees are not covered labs and books are
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
not covered necessarily by Grant
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
programs this would allow a student who
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
would otherwise want to go into that
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
program but the 500 lab fee becomes a
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
cash barrier for them would allow them
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
to enter in so that person is working
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
that part-time job McDonald's Walmart
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
pick your pick your corporation of
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
choice who's trying to move from a
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
part-time you know low-income job to a
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
higher wage job like a a two-year RN
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
right for our nursing industry would
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
free up the barriers to allow them to be
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
able to go into that into those
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities and saw New
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Workforce problem and give
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
us workers in a really short period of
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
time to solve some of our issues again
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
carpentry electrician are line workers
 
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.809 align:start position:0%
carpentry electrician are line workers
for

00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
um for our electric companies all of
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
these are types of jobs and careers high
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
paying careers I'll mind you that are
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
available out of the community college
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
system so as part of the other
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
negotiation I did as this is that we had
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the university
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire but they felt
 
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:47.660 align:start position:0%
left out
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
and so we were looking to support the
 
00:54:52.329 --> 00:54:52.339 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire as well
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
but related to a way of keeping again
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
students in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
so if a student was to complete their
 
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
associate's degree at the community
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
college system and then decided they
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
were going to go on to a four-year
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
degree how can we encourage them to take
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
the rest of their four-year degree in
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so what this
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
bill does is it allows a cooperation
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
effort between the community college
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
system and the university system so that
 
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:17.220 align:start position:0%
if a student graduates from the two-year
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
college and and is applying to four-year
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
colleges and they apply to UNH and they
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
apply let's say the University of Maine
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
it turns out the University of Maine is
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
cheaper than UNH it would allow the
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
community college system to basically
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
Grant a gap funding and pay it so that
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
the out-of-pocket for that person going
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
to UNH would be the same as if they went
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
to UMaine and allows that person to stay
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
for the remaining third and fourth year
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
of their education cycle uh college
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
education cycle to stay in New Hampshire
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
and we know that people are educated in
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and do their internships
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are more likely to stay
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so again this is uh the
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
idea to keep New Hampshire students in
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to help our Workforce I'm
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I know there's
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
going to be a whole lot of conversation
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
about because I've saw the emails they
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
were sent to me about cannibalization
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
are we going to cannibalize our
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
Charities and our charity is going to
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
lose money
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
understand this the Senate looked at all
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
the bills that you'll have and I think
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be your friend for the next
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
two days I think I have seven bills I'm
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
introducing over the next two days in
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
um all of those bills we looked at the
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming bills as a large
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
policy we didn't look it through a straw
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
of just 104. right we looked at we
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
looked at House Bill 607 which you guys
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
sent over to us we looked at Senate Bill
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
120 which you have as well as Senate
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 51 and a few others you have and we
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
looked holistically including the one
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
you just heard Senate Bill 112 which
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
deals with breakage and sending that to
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
the problem gaming fund recognizing
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
we're expanding gaming there may be in
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
more need of funding and so therefore we
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
looked at this holistically as all these
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
bills together as a as a charitable
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
gaming policy what it's doing when it
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
comes to cannibalization they'll hear
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
all kinds of Statistics one of them will
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
talk about New Jersey that lost Revenue
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
in the brick and mortar casinos however
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
if you normalize that data and what I
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
mean by that is they're comparing two
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
years one year that has
 
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.309 align:start position:0%
years one year that has
um

00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
X number of casinos and the next year
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
they have x minus two because two of
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
them went bankrupt and they went
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
bankrupt before online gaming went
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
online but they went bankrupt
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
um and therefore obviously you're going
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
to see a reduction in revenues with a
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
bankrupt organization bankrupt uh Casino
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
the next year's revenue is going to be
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
lower but if you normalize that out back
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
out to so we have x equals x so we we
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
normalize the data you'll see there was
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
no loss to the brick and mortar
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
Charities when New Jersey put online
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
gaming in place
 
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.549 align:start position:0%
gaming in place
um

00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll talk about is the
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
Charities we again you've I've got an
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
email about about how this is going to
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
hurt Charities but remember we passed
 
00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
house you guys passed House Bill 607
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
that raised the Wagers from ten dollars
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
to twenty five dollars and we'll hear
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
later in the in either today or tomorrow
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
remember where the bill is but about a
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
bill I put forward that raises it to
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars so that raising of the of
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
the Wagers and the and the tournament
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
Stakes are going to dramatically
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of Revenue going to
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
Charities again we looked at this
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
holistically to make sure everybody was
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
taken care of in negotiations with
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
um with director McIntyre in this bill
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh he agreed to
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
um doing again it's an app on your phone
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
and there'll be an advertising space so
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to advertise the brick and
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
mortise based on your geolocation if
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
you're in the state of New Hampshire it
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
will tell you where your closest brick
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
and mortar is if you don't want to play
 
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:37.460 align:start position:0%
online and you want to play against
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
human beings at a table it'll show you
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
where your closest brick and mortar is
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
to to encourage if you want to go play
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
and you want to take it from Just online
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
to in person where your closest places
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
to go play so again the Charities will
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
be served by that I'm happy to take
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
questions I know I talk fast and talked
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:02.150 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
chair

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Senator Lang my
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned to you last week that in
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
the state constitution it says that
 
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.030 align:start position:0%
the state constitution it says that
Lottery

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:17.180 align:start position:0%
money should be used exclusively for
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state so had you
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
have you had any time to look into that
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
and can you respond to
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
um if you agree with that and
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
also would you probably possibly be
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
amenable to changing where the profits
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
go to put it in the to direct it to
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
school districts it would go into the
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so I'll take
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
that I'll take it to two parts of that
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
question so the first was the
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of moving it moving
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
the money into the um
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
into the community college system so you
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look at when that
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
when that constitutional amendment was
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
passed it was when New Hampshire passed
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
its first lottery so the question is it
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
Lottery as defined by the division that
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
executive director McIntyre runs desert
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
Lottery as defined by sweepstakes which
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
is what was implemented at the time that
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
um that Constitutional Amendment went in
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
so I view it as it speaks about lottery
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the function not the
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
department so in this case we've already
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
decided that purposes of gaming that
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
Lottery can do charitable gaming and
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
that gaming which is managed by Lottery
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
goes to charities in this case so the
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
way I view it is no it's not a
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
constitutional prohibition
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I do I don't believe that I think if
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
we were trying to take Powerball money
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
and move that into some other function
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes I think that might be a problem
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
based on our constitution but in the
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
purposes of gambling I don't believe so
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think that's a different function
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your second question I
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
would prefer you not move the fund again
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
I was trying to solve a Workforce
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
problem I think we see we have an
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
acknowledged Workforce problem we know
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
how tight the state budget is
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
um the uh so I would not look at doing
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that I think this solves a problem for
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
low-income families and and families
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
that are struggling to be able to
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
provide an educational opportunity
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
either for the child or maybe if it's a
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
parent that's looking to move out of a
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
low dead end job and move into a
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
different career and the goal of this
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill is to do that not just to dump more
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay great and just I want to keep
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
things moving because we have a lot of
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this and unless you want
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
to work all the way through lunch you
 
01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
want to keep things moving to like quick
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions in three minutes if we need we
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
can do more later yes representative
 
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.530 align:start position:0%
can do more later yes representative
self-worth

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
self-worth
 
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
um when I'm looking at the estimates
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
um about 7 million 2024 then 27 million
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
then 40 million for 2026.
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear where that
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
money is coming from this is gross
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue uh that chart there I'm
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
um are some people gambling more is it
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
cutting into other lottery programs it
 
01:02:04.569 --> 01:02:04.579 align:start position:0%
just seems like you know it's an extra
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
34 million dollars that's coming from
 
01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
34 million dollars that's coming from
somewhere

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
um and I know we keep making changes and
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
adding things but I'm just wondering
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
like what is where's that money actually
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
going to come from
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
great so I think your question is around
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
a Tipping Point right where is it where
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
does it start cannibalizing our own
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
Lottery revenues so again I think we saw
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
and I think Executive Director McIntyre
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
can answer this is again I'll go back to
 
01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:27.740 align:start position:0%
sports betting which we implemented in
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
2019. it's generated over 70 million
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
dollars for the for education for the
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
education trust fund we didn't see
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
cannibalization the Powerball we didn't
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
see cannibalization into other areas of
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
of state-run Gaming I think that's the
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
only answer I can give you anything to
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
ask executive McIntyre the same question
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is just kind of
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
um there's more room in people gambling
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
more in New Hampshire I'd argue people
 
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
are already gambling in New Hampshire
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this just legalizes what they're
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
doing to bring Revenue to the state
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.589 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
yeah

01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
this is first a question for you chair
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and that is whether this bill is a
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
second is going to a second committee
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
given that it raises issues of
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
allocation to a particular goes to a
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
second committee but I'm going to double
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
check that okay uh and I'm going to ask
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
my helpers here to double check go
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
online and double check but I don't
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
believe it is a second committee bill
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
I guess on the uh uh you've you've
 
01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:38.420 align:start position:0%
answered the question on the uh
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue that raised by
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and I think
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that needs to be
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
explored but I I don't want to take time
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
here exploring it uh with the witness
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
any further because he's answering full
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative Olney
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to get clear
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
because I was having trouble figuring
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
this out on page three on Section seven
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
starting on line 13. online gaming
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
um means everything that is being done
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
in person Now offline correct
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
in charitable gaming I'm sorry can you
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
repeat the question I can have a hard
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
time hearing you gaming means everything
 
01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:28.130 align:start position:0%
time hearing you gaming means everything
that

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
um charitable gaming in person uh
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
on store um
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
sites are doing
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
but doing it online instead of offline
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes I think is the correct answer to
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
other other questions get music
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.829 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
um

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
I want to right now just focus on
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
finances rather than the
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
some of the other aspects of the bill
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire has the lowest
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
State support for public education in
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
the entire country
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
and while I absolutely support the
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
notion of community college students
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
getting support I'm wondering why we are
 
01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
getting support I'm wondering why we are
not

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
adding to the funding that we are
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
providing for
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
K through 12 or even preschool through
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
grade 12. education when we are the
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
lowest State support for public
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
education in the country
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
um so my other hat is I serve and I just
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
left the Senate education committee to
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
also serve on that committee as well and
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
this question came up as we were just
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
discussing efas
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I'd answer to you is
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
that number New Hampshire is number two
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
number two in the nation
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the quality of Education provided
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're number 48 relative to the amount
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
of money the state provides for the
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
purposes of Education So my answer to
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
you is the two aren't linked right we
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
can provide a quality good education As
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
proved by the number two rating that we
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
have in our state for the quality
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
education that we provide and at the
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
same point be cost efficient so
 
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.490 align:start position:0%
same point be cost efficient so
uh

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
follow up let me just remind the members
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not here to debate with the
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh with any sponsor or person testifying
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
we are here to ask clarifying questions
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Albert thank
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the money that goes to
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
public education comes out of local

here
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
not here to speak specifically to gaming
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
or anything other than our mission which
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
is Workforce and support for this state
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
creating opportunities for New Hampshire
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
students of any age to participate in
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
their communities and Workforce and the
 
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:43.220 align:start position:0%
Civic life of this state
 
01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
as Senator Lang described our students
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
are not typically traditionally students
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
the majority of our students are
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
part-time typically working adults
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
although they represent a cross-section
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
of of the population our objective is to
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
find ways to help them engage and again
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
as the senator described credit programs
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
non-credit shorter term certificate
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
programs things that are more directly
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
engaged with the workforce like lnas and
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
medical assistants and so forth but
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
nurses and paramedics welders and
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
Automotive technicians cyber security
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
folks the range of programs that we
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
offer aligns with the needs of this
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
state and our effort is simply to
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
support the opportunities for students
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
to help them engage this year I want to
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
say the house has been very kind to the
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
community college system in support from
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
the budget that's been passed gives us
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to provide those
 
01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities Provide support for a
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
broad cross-section of the students we
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
seek to serve from high school through
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment all the way through
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
their careers but we're also mindful of
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
the fact that the states always facing
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
challenges for Revenue
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
Senators bill has potential to provide a
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
funding source that ironically becomes
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
more stable when the state's revenues
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
May contract if the economy falters at a
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
time when students will have greater
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
need for opportunities to transition
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
into new careers new opportunities as
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
their lives change in the needs of the
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
states change so again not in a position
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
to speak knowingly about gambling my
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
mother will be grateful but here to
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
speak primarily about our mission as a
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
resource for the state and its
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
communities to strengthen the workforce
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
and create opportunities for New
 
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.689 align:start position:0%
and create opportunities for New
Hampshire

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would just add you know
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang mentioned a lot about that
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the skill the one-year two-year
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
certificate credentials but also on the
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
non-credit we call it the upskilling
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
side of things so CDL training I would
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
add to that you know we need more of
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
these folks out there and what I would
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
just simply add is this provides a
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
revenue stream that would allow for a
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
place we do not currently have one uh
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
you know we talked about books or fees
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
additionally but a lot of the folks who
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
are looking to upskill make it
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to stop and do some
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
of this training the upskilling without
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
being eligible for Aid or other
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
scholarships so this would provide that
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream to again put people right
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
to work right out into the workforce
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
and we welcome your questions
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis do you currently
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
have any programs that provide financial
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
assistance to the part-time adult
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
student and you know maybe the ones that
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
are looking for their certificates as
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know your your general
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
we we do have some resources in some
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
cases this is federal financial aid for
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
students who are half time or at least
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
half time we also have a significant
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
support through New Hampshire charitable
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
foundation for specific opportunities
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
working with the charitable foundation
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
and DHHS on a pilot program at
 
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:53.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester Community College for Ben
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of the snap program so we
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
have peace pieces of that puzzle but not
 
01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutritional assistance
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
program I believe is the uh the acronyms
 
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.290 align:start position:0%
program I believe is the uh the acronyms
source

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative only did you have a
 
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
representative only did you have a
question

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay uh questions over here
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative ORS
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question so can you give us an
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
example of somebody that you've helped
 
01:11:34.209 --> 01:11:34.219 align:start position:0%
that was in a low paying job whatever
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
non-skilled and you've brought them into
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
a skilled job that provides for our you
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
know helps our communities whether it's
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
electrician plumber hairdresser whatever
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
sure I'd love to take this one we've
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
actually got some students uh so I'm at
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
White Mountains Community College in the
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
North Country we have a location uh
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
Berlin North Conway Littleton I was in
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
Littleton just last week and uh you know
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
we have some students who their family
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
owns a truck dad has been the truck
 
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.050 align:start position:0%
owns a truck dad has been the truck
driver

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
driver
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
wife and daughter are now coming through
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the CDL program so they can all rotate
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
because there was a limit of the number
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
of hours you can drive in a truck so now
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
the entire family is able to drive that
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
truck and they'll be purchasing a new
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
one so now not only do they have a you
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
know a great income stream to be able to
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
contribute back but also they are now
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
running two trucks and now they're able
 
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of you know they pick
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
up loads and go back and forth so they
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
were not eligible for financial aid
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
however because of the income of the
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
father so what they do is they are
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
seeking scholarships or they're paying
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
it out of pocket right now so it takes a
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
little longer that to me is just one
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
small example of literally thousands of
 
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.770 align:start position:0%
small example of literally thousands of
them

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%

104 as it went through its various
iterations

01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
iterations
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anybody in the
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
University system or the community
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
college system can say that I was not
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
supportive when I was a member of this
 
01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:24.610 align:start position:0%
supportive when I was a member of this
body

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:24.620 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
for funding for those two institutions
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
because I am and I am supportive of the
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
idea of the grants and other things that
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
are contained in this bill I just think
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
that this is not the way to fund it
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that there's only so much
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
money available for wage rate when I
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
look at the fiscal note and I see 40
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars being wagered online
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the estimate in 2026 that's going to
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
come from some place I know that Senator
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
Lang said that with uh online Sports
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
gaming we didn't cannibalize anything
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we we tweaked uh
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
how much could be wagered at the brick
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
and mortar places and we also introduced
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing so you know you
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
got to put all these things together I
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
think that there will be a dilution of
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the Charities were able to get out
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
of the brick and mortar if we start
 
01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:28.219 align:start position:0%
taking 40 million dollars a year
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
additional online gaming it's going to
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
come from someplace
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I belong to three bedford-based
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
non-uh prophets all of which use
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming to supplement their
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
budgets and I do mean supplement let me
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
give you one example the Bedford
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
American Legion Post which we don't have
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
a building we don't have a bar or any of
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
this stuff to raise money
 
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.370 align:start position:0%
this stuff to raise money
um

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
last year 2022 we took in about twenty
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars from charitable
 
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.030 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars from charitable
gaming

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
however we gave out over eighteen
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in scholarships over
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars to support two
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
American Legion Baseball teams three
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
thousand for students to attend
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
um residential programs in local and
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
state government run by the American
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
Legion and at approximately two thousand
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
dollars to support local veterans plus
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire veterans home and the
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
residents at the VA so you see we spent
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
more that we took in from charitable
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
gaming I think that that's true of most
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
of the Charities if not all of the
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
Charities that are getting the money
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
so there is more than just a fiscal note
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
there is more than just what is going to
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
go to the educational system both um
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
the university system and primarily of
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
course the community college system I
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
think that the holistic approach that
 
01:15:57.729 --> 01:15:57.739 align:start position:0%
the senator talked about is probably
 
01:15:59.810 --> 01:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
skewed to the
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
um what they wanted in the Senate and
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
the house needs to take a different and
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
more in-depth uh look I would ask that
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
you find this bill in experiential
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislate I don't think you're going to
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue of what
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
is BET how it is BET what is going to be
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
taken away from the Charities what is
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to go into which pot of money
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
um with a single bill so I ask that you
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
find it in experience legislate and
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
I will try to answer any questions I am
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
fairly familiar I've been working on
 
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:41.780 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming since its Inception
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
decades ago thank you
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd oh and I forgot to
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
introduce representative Lloyd is here
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
she's substituting for representative
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
liply today yes yes
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and bear with me because number one I
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman by the way
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm a freshman and uh number two I I
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
come from a non-profit background myself
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
um so I've been working in non-profit
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
Finance for 14 years now and I I
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
completely understand the concern about
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that we continue to fund our
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
um our Charities
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
um but I also truly appreciate the the
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
ability of this to create an education
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
um a a
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
a scholarship fund for higher education
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's much needed in this state
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
um my question I guess is how currently
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
and again I'm a sub
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
um how how much currently do we receive
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
for uh for charitable donations through
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
on through regular brick and mortar
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
gambling locations and is there any way
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we can come up with some sort of
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
provision to make sure that we still
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
provide our charitable organizations
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
what they're currently getting and then
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
the remainder goes to the education each
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
charity and the facility that they work
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
with provide a daily account of money
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
wagered money given to the charity money
 
01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:17.780 align:start position:0%
kept um
 
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.370 align:start position:0%
kept um
by

01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the the facility owner what with the
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
rent was so the lottery should be able
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
to roll up all of those from all of the
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state what was
 
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.010 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state what was
wagered

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
wagered
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
um what went out to the Charities I know
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
that at one point
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
um a couple I don't remember how many
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
terms ago when we were talking about
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
um true casinos there was there was an
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
attempt to put in there that well we're
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to make whole the the Charities
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
um because it's going to suck the money
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
out of uh charitable gaming that came to
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
a very complicated and nobody truly
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
believed that it was going to last
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the first couple of years because
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
once you start getting the money in it's
 
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:05.540 align:start position:0%
up to succeeding
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
legislatures to decide where the money
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
goes it's nothing is permitted in this
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
building uh except when is uh prescribed
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative plan
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I heard from uh the sponsor Prime
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
sponsor Tim Lang
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
with some anecdote about New Jersey
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
instituted this and uh they didn't
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
really have a loss they lost a couple of
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
casinos but they were out before
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming so there's a point
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
that says there won't be
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
cannibalation cannibalization do you
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
have any specifics to point to to say
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
they would be no
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think you'll have any
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
until you actually start doing it and
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
then it's too late
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
um you know but if you just look at the
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note again where it says in two
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
years you're going to be taking 40
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars of online Wagers
 
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
that 40 million is not all going to be
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
new Wagers it's going to be taken from
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
people who might have gone down to
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
um Boston Billiards uh the one in
 
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.490 align:start position:0%
um Boston Billiards uh the one in
Manchester

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the one in Keene wherever
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
um Tibet
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
I sincerely think that there will be
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
less done in the brick and mortar if I
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
can sit at home in my PJs and at bed
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like what we were doing
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
zooms and and remote work
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
um it's much easier because you don't
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to get up and and come to Concord
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
I think that there will be a dilution of
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
what is BET at Brick and Mortar
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and no there's no way because we're
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
one of the few states that does the
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming if not the only one I
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
don't remember the way we do it where
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
the Charities partner with the facility
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and get a portion of the proceeds for
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
their charitable uh work and
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
we tweaked it last year last term so
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
that with historic horse racing being
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
added to the mix that the the facility
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
now the same 10 days there are two
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
charities in in the facility sharing the
 
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:34.460 align:start position:0%
revenue that was part of the law
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
it did not affect too much the the
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
bottom line of what each charity was
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
getting but again they're not competing
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
online with anything
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
um so and and sports betting is also not
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
being done in these brick and mortar uh
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming facilities so you know
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
you can't com uh compare the two of them
 
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
you can't com uh compare the two of them
either

01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay other hands up here representative
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
Doucette five thank you madam chair and
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Graham uh former
 
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative The Honorable John Graham
 
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.530 align:start position:0%
representative The Honorable John Graham
sorry

01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
and I I realize you have some knowledge
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh in relation to charitable gaming and
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
the model that we have and you kind of
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
answered a few of the things I was going
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
to ask you in your discussion answering
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett's question uh
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe if I offer to you that
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
our present model in New Hampshire for
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is unique in the
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
United States
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
I yeah I would believe that that's why
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
when I was just stumbling with with my
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
what I would say in a minute ago of if
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
if not the only one I I think that it is
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I wasn't going to categorically
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
say that without going back and checking
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
I would say we're safe to assume that
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
and and making comparisons to any other
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
state any other Casino gaming is not
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to Apples oranges to
 
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.770 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to Apples oranges to
oranges

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
oranges
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it's the same as when
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
um Encore uh opened in Boston there was
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
concern that there would be a big draw
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
from our brick and mortar ones but
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
because it's more low stakes local it's
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
not the big players that go into you
 
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
know Salem OR or Seabrook or any of
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
those other places yeah they may go down
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
to Encore once in a while but they know
 
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:33.260 align:start position:0%
that the money is going into Charities
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire whether it be the
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire food bank I know that some
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
of them do that and and others and I'm
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
sure you'll hear from others who use the
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
money for for that kind of stuff and I
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't I know the Chairman's looking at
 
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
her watch going uh there are other
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh Pink cards I remember having to do
 
01:23:53.699 --> 01:23:55.310 align:start position:0%
uh Pink cards I remember having to do
that

01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up Man follow up yes and and
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
because of your experience in the
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature going back historically
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
there was quite a tussle with big Casino
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
gaming and Us ending up with the model
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we have at present supporting the
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
Charities and supporting terrible gaming
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
so uh bear with me for a second we as a
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislature decided against big gaming
 
01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
in this state yes we did and and truth
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
in advertising I always voted against uh
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
traditional casinos and a lot poor
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
reason for that was to maintain our
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so that the Charities could do their
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
work in the local communities and not
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
hands over here is representative horse
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I don't know if
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
you ever really answered representative
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
plett's question about having hardcore
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
examples but uh representative descent
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
just made an interesting comment and two
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
and you've responded with so if we
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
didn't lose
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
Gamers or whatever they're called to
 
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.410 align:start position:0%
Gamers or whatever they're called to
Encore

01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
Encore
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
might might we be getting more people
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
involved in gambling with with adding
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
like DraftKings or whatever it might be
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
and not be losing people to you know the
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
other Charities I personally I do not
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
think so
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
um we did not lose them because the
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
BET's down down there are much larger
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
when you have to go down when we have
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
five or ten dollars I think what is it
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's ten now
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:37.850 align:start position:0%
it's ten now
um

01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
even at twenty dollars if you go to a a
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
major Casino where the the minimum bet
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
is twenty fifty hundred dollars on it on
 
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
a table you're not going to get the the
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
person like me who goes in with a group
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
of friends to play Blackjack
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
um at a couple dollars uh a hand
 
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and you're doing it for fun and
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing it because you know that
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
even if you lose the money is going to a
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
good place
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you nice to
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
see you uh okay the chair recognizes
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
oops I should replace my glasses Rebecca
 
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
Condon and Rich Parsons representing
 
01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.370 align:start position:0%
Condon and Rich Parsons representing
DraftKings

01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
DraftKings
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I have a sticky note from our
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
researcher Jennifer four I was incorrect
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ames uh we got these
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
bills really late for some reason so I
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
did not notice that this is an early
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
bill so Senate Bill 104 is an early bill
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
throughout May 11th
 
01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:43.310 align:start position:0%
throughout May 11th
so

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
welcome Madam chair is that due out of
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
the house or do out of this commission
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
I have to go back to look at my notes I
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
think out of the committee but I'd have
 
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay out of this building I just never
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember the dates then that
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
would mean that May 18th we'd have to
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
vote it would be the deadline to vote on
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you

well including instances of consumers

that were illegally wagering and were

not protected by the consumer
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
protections that would be afforded

including here in New Hampshire and we

take a lot of pride in our partnership
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire lottery as an
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
authorized agent of online and Retail
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
sports betting
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
online gaming offers the state an
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to capitalize on a new form
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
of Revenue providing citizens with new
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
forms of entertainment but without
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
having to raise taxes through November
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
of last year Connecticut a state roughly
 
01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:41.300 align:start position:0%
twice the size of New Hampshire
 
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
generated more than 36 million dollars
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
in taxes with important priorities like
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
funding education legalization of online
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
gaming creates an opportunity to open
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
new doors
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
importantly we've seen that legalized
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
online gaming does not cannibalize other
 
01:28:59.410 --> 01:28:59.420 align:start position:0%
forms of legal gaming you've heard
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
citations to New Jersey today what we've
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's the most mature and most robust
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
gaming state in the country and gross
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue across all gaming sectors
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
including Lottery land-based casinos
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
sports betting and online gaming have
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
grown since 2018 with the numbers from
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
2022 expected to be the highest for all
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
gaming X sectors
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
what we see in those who are most likely
 
01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
to participate in online gaming are not
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
doing so at the expense of existing
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
markets because it's typically users who
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
are doing so illegally and are of
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
different demographic than those of
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
current legal options
 
01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:43.100 align:start position:0%
the American gaming Association
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
estimates there's as much as 338 billion
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
dollars wagered illegally annually
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
Nationwide including 46 billion dollars
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast alone
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
much like the successful Sports wagering
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
Market in the granite state legalizing
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
online gaming creates a market with a
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
known product where consumers are
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
guaranteed the protections they don't
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
receive in the illegal Market
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
should you choose to legalize New
 
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be the first in Northern
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
New England to legalize online casino
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
products opening the market to
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
neighboring states much like you did
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
when you led on online sports betting
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
and Retail sports betting
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
to my point about taking consumer
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
protection seriously we
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
take the time to educate our customers
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
on the tools available to them like time
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
and deposit limits cool off periods and
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
resources to continue to use our
 
01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
products for entertainment purposes we
 
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
fund responsible gaming initiatives and
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
research collaborate with stakeholders
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
and work to better understand our
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
players while training our employees to
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand signs of problem gaming New
 
01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the opportunity to lead in
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
the sector it provides additional
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
entertainment and revenue for your state
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to answer any
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you have this morning
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you what do you mean by of a
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
different demographic sure so online
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
casino users typically are younger than
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar uh users and we saw one
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
example which is cited in your packet
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
that 80 percent of online users for one
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
specific Casino in Pennsylvania were
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
entirely unknown previously to that
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
casino so they were not in that casino's
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question then the market in in
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
sports gaming has been mentioned a few
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
times the market for sports betting
 
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
online sports betting is
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
totally different from online gaming in
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
this form no
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
so to make it to make a comparison
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
between online sports betting and online
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
gaming table games
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're again apples and oranges thank
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative um
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
one way that you could see the
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
similarities is that some users who
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
prefer to go to get their ticket at a
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
retail facility for Sportsbook is
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
typically a different demographic than
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
those who place their Sports Wagers on
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
their phones or mobile devices much like
 
01:32:31.209 --> 01:32:31.219 align:start position:0%
those who prefer to go to physical
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
locations to place a table game wager is
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
also a different demographic than those
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
that typically wager online and
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
therefore it opens up a new market of
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
users to
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:55.139 align:start position:0%
oh is there is that Lit for a reason yes
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Jordan ulrey thank you
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
question questions two primary questions
 
01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.970 align:start position:0%
question questions two primary questions
uh

01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the information you provided in here
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
appears to deal with illegal gaming and
 
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.149 align:start position:0%
appears to deal with illegal gaming and
yet

01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
the issue that we've received the most
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
comment on is
 
01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
um cannibalization to use Senator Lang's
 
01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.669 align:start position:0%
um cannibalization to use Senator Lang's
terminology

01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistical data on that
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
particular aspect representative thank
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
you for that question we do have
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
um there's a chart in your packet
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
um that looks like this
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
um it has different uh
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
um tables on it I suppose and that shows
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
the eye Gaming revenue versus the casino
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
revenue in four of the legal
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions here in the United States
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
follow up man chair
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
pull up
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
fine each one of these states has full
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
legalized gaming we don't
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
we have charitable gaming do you have
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
any information about charitable gaming
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
and its effect because that's a kind of
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
a different animal if you will
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and what I would say is as has been
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
noted this morning it is that New
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does have a unique way that
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
they deal with brick and mortar
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
locations I think
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
two things that would make us be able to
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
extrapolate the same information as
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
what's available in your packet is that
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're offering the same types of games
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
that are available at your brick and
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
mortar locations and that um again
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're different demographics
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
of users uh and they're so therefore we
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
would expect that you could
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and that gaming grows across all
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
sectors in legal online casino States
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%

um not just in the brick and mortar
facilities

01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
and Rich Parsons just um rip Granite
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
strategy is also at DraftKings to also
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
point out those other states also have
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
slots in their eye gaming products so
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
this is which make up roughly about 50
 
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.770 align:start position:0%
this is which make up roughly about 50
of

01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
um gaming in those States okay the
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
technical question what please it's not
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
a follow-up different question
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
um you indicate that uh or the builds
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
indicates that it would be limited to
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
Geo limited geopens if you will to New
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
I can look like I'm in France
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
with a VPN
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
how does that work absolutely I really
 
01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question representative
 
01:35:38.219 --> 01:35:39.890 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question representative
we

01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
um as I was talking about our consumer
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
protections one of the things that we do
 
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
is we work with sophisticated technology
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
providers to make sure that users cannot
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
spoof their location by using VPN or
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
other locations spoofing measures we
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
already do that with our product our
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
sports betting product here in New
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's the same technology
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's been tested and proven across
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
sports betting and online gaming across
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
the country where our technology
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
providers are able to detect those sorts
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
of technology and and prevent an
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
individual trying to wager that's not
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
located within the state of New
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
being that we are talking about a
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
different demographic which is the same
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
one that is supposedly being helped by
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.649 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
could do you have any data on the
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of people that are using the
 
01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:52.739 align:start position:0%
the products that on
 
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
are putting limits on their own gaming
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
activity that's a really wonderful
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
question representative and I really
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%

have those statistics off the top of my
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
head but I'd be more than happy to work
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%

apologize thank you thank you madam
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for another question
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
here I'm curious if the platform you
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
have in place in four states right now
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
other five states and Ontario okay uh
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
other a and I know it can be addressed
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
eight uh limits to the table Stakes we
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
have a ten dollar limit in New Hampshire
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
are there any limits in those five
 
01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.430 align:start position:0%
are there any limits in those five
states

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.629 align:start position:0%
states
currently

01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
none that are imposed in State Statute
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
but we do have user imposed
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
and and with that platform I even I
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
haven't actually used the DraftKings
 
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:04.580 align:start position:0%
platform but I'm sure you're aware
 
01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
Foxwoods has put out a beta system for
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
online betting platform and in my
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
experience sitting at home in my
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable clothing
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
would it be possible on your platform to
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
deal myself 1200 hands of blackjack in
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
one hour on your platform three hands at
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
a time four hands at a time but with
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
that rapidity
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
so um the way the way my understanding
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
is because I also live in a jurisdiction
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
where our product is not legal is that
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
you are you're at a table and and you're
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
playing it as if you were you know at a
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
table in a location
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up so on your platform is
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to be at multiple tables at
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
available uh to be entirely honest with
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
you representative I'm not sure but I
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
can um I'll follow up with you you're
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
not sure okay
 
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.450 align:start position:0%
not sure okay
okay

01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much okay I'm
 
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
just trying to go back and forth between
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
Pro versus con so we will now recognize
 
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
Pro versus con so we will now recognize
John

John
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%

01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
Eric queso from Meals on Wheels I
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
apologize please help us understand how
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
you did a great job
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
is John araquezzo and I am the president
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
and CEO of Meals on Wheels of
 
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and we are a
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
recipient of charitable gaming and and
 
01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:48.860 align:start position:0%
very uh proud that the state supports it
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
this is an Innovative Bill and offers a
 
01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:54.260 align:start position:0%
lot of solutions to a lot of problems
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
however I I don't think an adequate the
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note adequately addresses the
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
income that the state is expecting
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
if if you could note it talks about in
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
Gross eye gaming revenues across four
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
states it doesn't really analyze gross
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
gaming revenues so I I've always viewed
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
this as a bubble as a balloon you know
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
you squeeze one end and
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to pop out here and get
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
smaller at the other end and and I'm
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
still of the belief that it's just
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
shifting monies around and
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and so to say that there's gross uh
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know because New Jersey is going to
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
get 138 million in Gross uh gaming
 
01:40:45.169 --> 01:40:45.179 align:start position:0%
revenues we can expect the same it
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
really instead of looking at eye gaming
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
it needs to look at gross gaming across
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
and so until that's until that's fully
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
vetted I'm very concerned about what
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
this could possibly do to Charities and
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep it short and and my
 
01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.669 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep it short and and my
testimony

01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions yes other
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%

um consistent with Chancellor Rubenstein
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
Stein's testimony we are not taking a
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
position on online gaming but the
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%

01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
efforts to encourage our New Hampshire
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
students to achieve their educational
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
goals here in New Hampshire and and this
 
01:41:57.890 --> 01:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
is one way that um
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
we can do so by supporting community
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
college students but also supporting
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
efforts of the community college system
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
and the university system in transfer
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Pathways House Bill 1530 I think was
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
passed last session and we are working
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
closely and collaboratively with the
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
community college system to ensure that
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
transfer pathways are seamless for
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
students from the community college
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
system to the university system and
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 104 provides a
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
more opportunity and incentive to help
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
those students that wish to transfer to
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
a four-year degree we have some pretty
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
significant demographic challenges ahead
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
that are going to
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
truly impact the workforce the
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
demographic challenges across the
 
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
Northeast are making for very stiff
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
competition in higher education and
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
states are trying to steal students from
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
other states and Senate bill again 104
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity to keep our New
 
01:42:59.410 --> 01:42:59.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students here at a lower cost
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
than than a traditional four-year degree
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
our college going population is changing
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
lots of non-traditional students
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
students that start later students that
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
stop and start there's not a lot of
 
01:43:17.050 --> 01:43:17.060 align:start position:0%
direct State support for scholarships
 
01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
across the uh the state and especially
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
frankly for the non-traditional students
 
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
that attend the community college system
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 104 would would provide
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
such an opportunity I'm happy to take
 
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your oh I
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
apologize did you have your hand up did
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Army
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't want to ask this of
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
the previous people because you may have
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
more of an idea when uh online sports
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
betting started in this state
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
um have you seen any increase in
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
financial difficulties of the as they
 
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:02.780 align:start position:0%
put it demographic
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh that would be both benefited and
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
could be harmed by this not that I'm
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
aware of Representative Almy I haven't
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
studied that but not that I'm aware of
 
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:19.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to ask a
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
clarifying question thank you for taking
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.790 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say you're not
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily supportive of SB 104 but you
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
are supportive of any bill that would
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
help fund the university system
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
um yes not just not just the university
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
system again this is about all of our
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students who seek to
 
01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:48.020 align:start position:0%
achieve another level of educational
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
benefit so the answer is yes I would
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay good okay good
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you so
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
going back and forth we have Bill Dunlap
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Historical Society
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
sir could you do me a favor and just
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
turn on the button on the right you'll
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
see a red thing that comes on no on the
 
01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.030 align:start position:0%
see a red thing that comes on no on the
bottom

01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
yes there you go thank you sorry uh this
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Historical Society is
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
celebrating his 200th anniversary this
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
year so we've been around a long time we
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
like many charitable organizations the
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
state uh really depend on the funding we
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
get from the charitable gaming program
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has a very lean and
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
efficient state government and I think
 
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.430 align:start position:0%
efficient state government and I think
non-profits

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
play arguably a greater role in this
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
state than maybe any other in the
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
country we're one example
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
um uh a few years ago we became aware of
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
a real problem in elementary education
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the area of History social studies
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
and Civics the curriculum was out of
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
date and it was not being taught as much
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
as it had been in previous years and we
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
stepped in and developed a curriculum we
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
raised 1.2 million dollars in private
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
donations and used our own resources as
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
well to develop a new curriculum for
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
that were being were providing free of
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
charge to every school in the state as
 
01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:32.219 align:start position:0%
well as homeschoolers it's very
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
successful called Moose on the loose we
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do this without uh
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
the substantial support we get from a
 
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
lot of our stakeholders one of the key
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
ones is charitable gaming our annual
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
fund is about three hundred thousand
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and that's part important
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
part an important part of our Revenue
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of that total comes from
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming funding
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
so we rely on it and I'd just like to
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
close by saying that I have no
 
01:47:04.679 --> 01:47:06.010 align:start position:0%
close by saying that I have no
statistical

01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:06.020 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
data to talk about so-called
 
01:47:12.129 --> 01:47:12.139 align:start position:0%
cannibalization or diversion of funding
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
from currents current sources but it
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
just seems to me as a practical matter
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
sort of common sense if you look at
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
e-commerce in the world of business the
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
availability of of buying products
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
online certainly has an impact on bricks
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
and mortar and I I can't believe it
 
01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
would not be the same case here thank
 
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:36.950 align:start position:0%
would not be the same case here thank
you

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognizes Randy Pierce
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what this is exactly
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
but for future sight but I'm missing a
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
word future insight there it is okay
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much Madam chair I am
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
randy Pierce from future Insight who
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
many of you may know by our 110 year
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
history as the New Hampshire Association
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
for the Blind and you know we have a
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
difficult task just like you right we
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
serve the whole state from
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
every age birth to Earth as we say and
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
we serve every aspect low vision to no
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
vision and that's a big charge there's
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
28 000 people in our state that that
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
affects and I share those numbers
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
because I want to share a couple of
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
numbers right ways and means you're
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
focused on numbers and you should be
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
the the bill is put forth to solve a
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
problem and provide funding where
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
there's a need and I get that but I want
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
to talk about where our need is right in
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
the last five years Public Funding has
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
dropped 62 percent that's a result of
 
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
how the world reacts in the last two
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
years we introduced historic horse
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
racing which has been a benefit in fact
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang talked about how they
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
looked at it holistically how can they
 
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
help benefit the Charities even as they
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
may take away a little from the
 
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
Charities and the reality is it cut our
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
our benefit almost in half in the last
 
01:49:06.649 --> 01:49:06.659 align:start position:0%
year from that and I understand the
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
reasons and maybe that will grow and
 
01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%
have room to grow because candidly
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming has grown slightly
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
every year to help us do what we do but
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge we're faced is so
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
it did get halved if this bill passes
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
what amount will it reduce it's
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
speculative but you know even in the
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
best case example I heard 20 were not
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
new demographics you're going to take
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
away 20 of our funding again that'd be
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
significant and
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is find solutions for
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
all the problems that's what we as
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
Charities are trying to do to fill in
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
the gap
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
and in doing that it helps when we can
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
have a budget and some predictability
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
and what does the amount we lost last
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
year represent it represents one VRT
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Vision Rehabilitation therapist now most
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation if you have a physical
 
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
disability you need that help you get
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
that support it's even medically paid
 
01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.270 align:start position:0%
that support it's even medically paid
for

01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
but sensory Rehabilitation doesn't apply
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you're blind if you're a senior who's
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
losing sight so significantly that you
 
01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
can't navigate your home we have to go
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
into your home whether you live in
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
Colebrook where I grew up whether you
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
live in Nashua where I lived all my life
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
we've got to travel to you
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
and one VRT salary means two visits a
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
day because three hours and whatever
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
geographic location we're going to you'd
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
multiply that times five days times 52
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
weeks that's how many people now aren't
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
going to get just a three hour visit
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
and boy when you lose your sight three
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
hour visit is probably not enough to
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
help you gauge and adjust all the things
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
you need now we're going to do that
 
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
either way but we're going to have to
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
reduce the number if you reduce our
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
number and that's why I'm here to plea
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
for you to really consider if you don't
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
have enough confidence that there is no
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
impact and you're not prepared to
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
understand the real person impact that
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
that means
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
then maybe this is the time to say no to
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
that bill to make sure you'd give that
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
security and to find what other avenues
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
may exist because I don't think this is
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
a new stream I think it may have some
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
new stream potential but it's going to
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
have a lot of old stream detriment and
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's what I'd like to avoid and the
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
reason I know that is because right 33
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
years ago when I went blind if I didn't
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
get that basic training if I didn't get
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
that support I wouldn't be a
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
contributing member of society as I am
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
today as I lead the organization
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I wonder how many of the people that
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
we serve today can't get that level of
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
service already because of the
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
reductions and how many more will
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
struggle to meet each year so thank you
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
for consideration I'll happily take any
 
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.689 align:start position:0%
for consideration I'll happily take any
questions

01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
swirl however my guy Doug will not
 
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:33.020 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes thank you in
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
full disclosure both Randy Pierce and I
 
01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
are lions and he came from it was in the
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
Hudson line for the longest time and you
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
associate with Concord now so I'm still
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
a Hudson lion member because I pay
 
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
attention to my roots but I'm also an
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
associate member at the Concord Lions
 
01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to put that forth
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why I knew him he runs future
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
insight and I treasure Lion's sight and
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
hearing Foundation
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
um but I did not understand with your
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
testimony how your benefit did get cut
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
in half you said was that Federal yeah
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
no no no that's so that was a decision
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
with historic horse racing we know
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to raise the revenues but
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
we also split it now so Charities have
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
to share that time and while they didn't
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
quite cut it in half it was very close
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I support that I mean we won't help
 
01:52:22.729 --> 01:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
all the Charities we're all doing good
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
things out here but the more you splice
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
it the more you reduce it the more that
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
affects our bottom line budget how we
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
and for the record my family has
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
received many of your great services and
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate it thank you for
 
01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
what you do other questions
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
okay sing none thank you very much thank
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%

Association we appear in opposition to
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 104. and I'm not going to
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
take a lot of your time I put down two
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to try to hold uh to
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
that uh I a couple of points I'd like to
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
make first uh representative Lloyd I
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
believe asked a question
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
how much does charity gaming generate uh
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
currently so we mailed out a brochure to
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
the whole house and when we put that
 
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
together last November the amount was
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
about 20 million dollars uh the previous
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
year right now if you look at the
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
numbers from Lottery it looks to me like
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're probably on track to be somewhere
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
around 25 perhaps even 28 million uh in
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
as as those numbers have gone up so and
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
that that is a benefit that is spread
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
out among
 
01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:01.310 align:start position:0%
out among
um

01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
well at least about a thousand Charities
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
to share that money we are very
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh online gaming uh
 
01:54:12.169 --> 01:54:12.179 align:start position:0%
particularly the way this bill presents
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
it with no limits on Wagers and that
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and and what it will what
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
impact it will have we've we have seen
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
the impact when for instance Encore in
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when during covet when
 
01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:30.179 align:start position:0%
they're they tighten their hours when
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
they got rid of Poker we saw our numbers
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
go up
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
when they brought poker back for
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
instance we saw our numbers go down
 
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
there's a I mean it's just it's a real
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
correlation so uh I've seen the ads from
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
DraftKings that are I think effective
 
01:54:51.169 --> 01:54:51.179 align:start position:0%
advertising where they say you know when
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's bad weather stay on your couch and
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
bet from home
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
and uh you know if you encourage people
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
to do that of course you're going to
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
take them away from brick and mortar
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
from the charity casinos couple of
 
01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
Statistics I want to give you
 
01:55:05.699 --> 01:55:07.189 align:start position:0%
Statistics I want to give you
um

01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
charity gaming employs about 1500 people
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the state now believe it or not think
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
about that I mean we have you know 1500
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
people working and I'll tell you that
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
about three years ago
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
a dealer was making
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of eight to ten
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour plus tips and the tips
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
are very good so dealers were very happy
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
you can't get dealers for eight to ten
 
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
dollars anymore so you're paying
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
20 22 some even more to get uh workers
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
just like every other business has seen
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
a post-covered world wages wages have
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
gone up and that has had which means
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
obviously the employees are making more
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
money but
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
online gaming produces zero jobs I mean
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
there will be there's no job creation
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
and this and in fact we think it will
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
cost jobs because it will see a
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in uh revenue for the
 
01:56:05.050 --> 01:56:05.060 align:start position:0%
Charities so I I think it's important to
 
01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
consider the job implication the number
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
of Charities that are benefited and the
 
01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:14.219 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we generally that
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
we generate to Charities
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
um finally I don't have it with me but I
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
have seen a study by Deutsche Bank which
 
01:56:24.890 --> 01:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
I will send to the committee after this
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
hearing uh where New Jersey Pennsylvania
 
01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
Michigan they saw a 12 percent drop in
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar casino revenue when
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
online gaming went
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh into effect uh so I I will share that
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
with you and I'll end my testimony there
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are you open to
 
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions I am
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
going around the room
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for people who want to
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
testify the uh Charlie McIntyre is here
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
if we had technical questions for him
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
wow we ended before lunch what that's a
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
miracle right there uh is there anyone
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
else here who would like to testify on
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 104. seeing none we will
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
close the public healing and we will be
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
in recess until
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing on
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 51. the chair recognizes
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Tim Lang who will introduce the
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
bill welcome back
 
03:03:14.570 --> 03:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
03:03:16.849 --> 03:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my testimony again
 
03:03:18.650 --> 03:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
you'll hear me at least twice more today
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
uh next two bills are also mine so
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
um uh Senate bill 51.
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
um there was a conversation that
 
03:03:28.730 --> 03:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
occurred uh but so the first thing this
 
03:03:30.050 --> 03:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
thing does it establish a study
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee to look at what's going on in
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and and how revenues
 
03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
are being split and and those kind of
 
03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
things uh and it and it extends the
 
03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium out an additional two years
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
basically until 2026.
 
03:03:47.690 --> 03:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
um so I'll talk a little bit about why
 
03:03:50.210 --> 03:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
this bill came forward so originally
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
when historic horse racing was passed we
 
03:03:54.769 --> 03:03:54.779 align:start position:0%
put a three-year moratorium on there and
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
the idea was to see what is this going
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
to do to our revenues how is it going to
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
impact the Charities how's it going to
 
03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
impact gaming operators how it's going
 
03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
to impact the state
 
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
um the problem was that through
 
03:04:09.050 --> 03:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
negotiations between the state the
 
03:04:10.730 --> 03:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
channel gaming operators and
 
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
representatives the rules for this
 
03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
particular form of gaming HHR took 18
 
03:04:20.450 --> 03:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
months after passage before they were
 
03:04:22.429 --> 03:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
adopted so half of the moratorium had
 
03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
gone by we don't before a single license
 
03:04:28.490 --> 03:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
was even issued so the goal of this bill
 
03:04:30.530 --> 03:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
is to extend the more to warm out a
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
little further form a study committee
 
03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
and take a look at what the impact of
 
03:04:36.830 --> 03:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing along with other
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming functions
 
03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:39.710 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming functions
um

03:04:39.710 --> 03:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
have on our Charities so I don't know if
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know but when you talk about
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing the revenue splits
 
03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
that occur for table games versus
 
03:04:50.690 --> 03:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing are different
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so we don't know what the impact of
 
03:04:56.690 --> 03:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
this is so before we unleash this on
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
anybody you know however many more
 
03:05:00.050 --> 03:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
operators we kind of want to take a look
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
at what that Revenue split is doing to
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
the Charities how that's working whether
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's beneficial to the Charities or
 
03:05:07.370 --> 03:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
harmful to the Charities what's going on
 
03:05:09.950 --> 03:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
but we need data to do that which means
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's only currently I think seven
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
operating HHR locations out of the I
 
03:05:16.010 --> 03:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
think there's 16 if Charlie's here you
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
can correct me but I think 15. 16
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
licenses that have been issue that are
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for HHR only seven have chosen
 
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
to implement and even of those seven I
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
think two of them came on in the last
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
couple months and so the point is to
 
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
extend out the moratorium collect the
 
03:05:32.750 --> 03:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
data on what's going on in these General
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
gaming locations and how it impacts our
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
Charities here in New Hampshire
 
03:05:39.650 --> 03:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none sweet thank you okay and uh
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
The Honorable representative Pat abrami
 
03:05:50.929 --> 03:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
is here
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh
 
03:05:58.130 --> 03:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
hello committee
 
03:06:00.050 --> 03:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
so uh Madam chairman here to support the
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
bill uh first off
 
03:06:03.889 --> 03:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
understand there were originally two two
 
03:06:05.450 --> 03:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
Senate bills there was Senator
 
03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
Dalessandro's Bill 90 Senate Bill 90 and
 
03:06:09.650 --> 03:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lang's Senate Bill 51 uh
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator donisandro's Bill was a
 
03:06:17.570 --> 03:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
pure commission Bill and then Senator
 
03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
langsville was a commission bill but
 
03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
also included this uh continued
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
moratorium on uh game operators from
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
having uh uh historic racing
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
so and then representative Ames had
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
House Bill 220 which I saw was uh which
 
03:06:38.570 --> 03:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
did a lot of the same things but as a
 
03:06:40.010 --> 03:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee a joint committee with the
 
03:06:42.130 --> 03:06:42.140 align:start position:0%
Senate and not a commission
 
03:06:44.990 --> 03:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh understand the commission is going to
 
03:06:48.769 --> 03:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
include people from the AG's office from
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the lottery from actually some Charities
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the game operators as
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
well to make it a broader a group of
 
03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
well to make it a broader a group of
people

03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:06:57.840 --> 03:06:59.769 align:start position:0%
people
uh

03:06:59.769 --> 03:06:59.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
so the but the Senate merged the two
 
03:07:05.450 --> 03:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
bills and they they itl uh Senator
 
03:07:07.309 --> 03:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
Dalessandro's bill
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
now before he filed the bill Senator
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
Alessandro called me
 
03:07:13.250 --> 03:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
because I've been very involved in this
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
total charitable gaming thing and he
 
03:07:16.370 --> 03:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
says Pat how'd you like to be on the
 
03:07:16.380 --> 03:07:17.690 align:start position:0%
says Pat how'd you like to be on the
commission

03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:07:19.849 --> 03:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
and I said sure as a matter of fact I'd
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
like you to chair it
 
03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
but that's that's up to the commission
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
once it's formed as to who's going to
 
03:07:28.969 --> 03:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
chair it uh so uh that's why they they
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
put in the bill a a
 
03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
citizen appointed by the governor
 
03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
citizen appointed by the governor
so

03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:37.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:07:37.490 --> 03:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:39.290 --> 03:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
again last term we had a joint committee
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh studying this as well
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh and it was representative Ames was
 
03:07:50.929 --> 03:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
on it senator of Representative Doucet
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
was on it I was on it and we when we did
 
03:07:55.849 --> 03:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
a pretty good a pretty good job I
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
thought of of looking at we toured we
 
03:08:01.550 --> 03:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
toured five of these locations uh two in
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
Nashua one in Keene one in Manchester
 
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
and one in Seabrook
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know we asked a lot of questions we
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
saw for our very eyes that they have the
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
cameras everywhere on the players on the
 
03:08:19.010 --> 03:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
dealers we saw that there were cameras
 
03:08:21.010 --> 03:08:21.020 align:start position:0%
in that cage where the money's counted
 
03:08:25.849 --> 03:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh and from our tertiary review it
 
03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
appeared that a lot of the rules and
 
03:08:30.530 --> 03:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
regulations that you would find in a
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
true Casino are in place
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
but now that charitable gaming is
 
03:08:39.530 --> 03:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
growing even more uh I think it's time
 
03:08:39.540 --> 03:08:40.610 align:start position:0%
growing even more uh I think it's time
to

03:08:40.610 --> 03:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
even look even further I know Senator
 
03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
Senator I promoted to representative
 
03:08:48.530 --> 03:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
Ames years ago when we were still
 
03:08:51.290 --> 03:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
looking at uh regular regular large size
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
casinos did a lot of work in developing
 
03:08:56.929 --> 03:08:56.939 align:start position:0%
rules regulations and I'm sure in your
 
03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
executive in your executive when your
 
03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
second issue probably
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
add to what I'm about to say but uh that
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
was very helpful it was now whether or
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
not all of those kind of things are in
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
how we're looking at our current
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is is another story
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
so so with with that said the other
 
03:09:21.050 --> 03:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
there's another provision in here
 
03:09:21.060 --> 03:09:21.889 align:start position:0%
there's another provision in here
um

03:09:21.889 --> 03:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
that is asking for 250 thousand dollars
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
now I don't want I don't want this bill
 
03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
to die because Finance doesn't want to
 
03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
see 250 000 spent on this I think we can
 
03:09:37.370 --> 03:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
do it without the 250 000 I think that
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
250 000 will allow us to hire
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh outside experts to come in and maybe
 
03:09:47.450 --> 03:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
do reviews of our charitable locations I
 
03:09:49.730 --> 03:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know but I'm not quite sure how
 
03:09:51.769 --> 03:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend that money uh but
 
03:09:53.290 --> 03:09:53.300 align:start position:0%
that that is in the bill
 
03:09:55.969 --> 03:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
uh just uh just this morning I printed
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
where we are uh yeah you know this month
 
03:10:01.370 --> 03:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
and by the way and the bill says that
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
that money will come out of this year's
 
03:10:02.939 --> 03:10:04.429 align:start position:0%
that money will come out of this year's
Surplus

03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
Surplus
 
03:10:06.530 --> 03:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay but to be spent next year
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay and the other thing is that this
 
03:10:11.630 --> 03:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
bill is is a goes a year and a half it
 
03:10:13.610 --> 03:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't it isn't a commission that ends
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
next November it ends in November 24. uh
 
03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
which is good because you know uh I
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
think it will need that time
 
03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:22.730 align:start position:0%
think it will need that time
so

03:10:22.730 --> 03:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:22.740 --> 03:10:23.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
but we're as of this morning I've the
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
report that you'll get where it was 66.9
 
03:10:31.370 --> 03:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
ahead of Target just in this month alone
 
03:10:34.250 --> 03:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh and that brings us
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
to have it here somewhere
 
03:10:39.889 --> 03:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
that brings us to I don't know nearly
 
03:10:41.929 --> 03:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
400 uh
 
03:10:44.330 --> 03:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
I got it right here that that thing is a
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
390 right now you had a date uh but
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be well above 400 000 above Target
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
now whether or not Finance has already
 
03:10:53.090 --> 03:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
spent that money is another question I'm
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
assuming Senate has this 250 in their
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
radar I'm not sure if we do or not on
 
03:11:02.030 --> 03:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
our side here on the house side
 
03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
um very good and then the only other
 
03:11:05.690 --> 03:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say about extending that
 
03:11:07.969 --> 03:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
date you know last thought
 
03:11:07.979 --> 03:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
date you know last thought
so

03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
um let me lose my notes Here
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.479 --> 03:11:22.969 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:11:22.969 --> 03:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:25.490 --> 03:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
as Senator as representative Senator
 
03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
Lang said
 
03:11:30.050 --> 03:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh the game operator moratorium
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean okay so we went back to May
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
1st you had to be
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
a a game operator for charitable gaming
 
03:11:36.479 --> 03:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
a a game operator for charitable gaming
employer

03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
as of May 1st 2020 to be eligible to be
 
03:11:45.889 --> 03:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
to take on uh historic racing and that
 
03:11:49.969 --> 03:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
moratorium went to July 1st of 2024.
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
this bill changes that to July 1st of
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
2026 another two years
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that if you or I wanted
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
to get a license to be a game operator
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
employer it doesn't stop you from doing
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
that you can still become a game
 
03:12:07.610 --> 03:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
operator employer if you pass all the
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
rules the regular background checks and
 
03:12:11.150 --> 03:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
everything else but you just can't have
 
03:12:12.650 --> 03:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
historic racing
 
03:12:15.349 --> 03:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay this is a moratorium on new
 
03:12:15.359 --> 03:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay this is a moratorium on new
facilities

03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:12:19.870 --> 03:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
that became charitable gaming locations
 
03:12:24.650 --> 03:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
after May 1st of 2020. so I just want to
 
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
make sure that's clear so it doesn't
 
03:12:27.889 --> 03:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
prevent anybody from becoming a
 
03:12:32.210 --> 03:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:34.130 --> 03:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
but you can't just have Charo you cannot
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
have historic racing for additional two
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
years going all the way out to 2026 so
 
03:12:41.809 --> 03:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions thank you oh we'll
 
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
start over here representative Phillips
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
um could could you just give me your
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
opinion on the scope of what the
 
03:12:55.130 --> 03:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
committee is looking at it looks it
 
03:12:57.290 --> 03:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
looks pretty narrow to me it doesn't
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
seem to look at any yes that sometimes
 
03:13:02.330 --> 03:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
that happens in these commissions every
 
03:13:04.250 --> 03:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
commission I've I've chaired probably
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
five commissions over the years
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
once we get rolling we always broaden
 
03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
those the scope as we once we once we
 
03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
start digging and finding issues we
 
03:13:15.170 --> 03:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
broaden the scope
 
03:13:16.870 --> 03:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think there are other things
 
03:13:19.490 --> 03:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh that we'll probably be looking at
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
03:13:22.730 --> 03:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
again I didn't I didn't write the scope
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
I I just you know
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
pull up yep so I'm you know I'm fairly
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
new but I've seen other bills that say
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
things like when you have a study
 
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee or Commission in in the
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
usually the last sentences and other
 
03:13:40.849 --> 03:13:40.859 align:start position:0%
relevant things
 
03:13:42.889 --> 03:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
some something along that line so it
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't have a statement
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
like that dude
 
03:13:49.130 --> 03:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be a good idea
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
should should well if you feel again
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's never stopped me in the past that
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's not believe me there's there's no
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
police if you will that view what uh
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
what a commission does be honest with
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
you I've shared a lot of them
 
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
and uh we we take us with a facts lead
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
and then if we we turn into the stone
 
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
over and we see something that we need
 
03:14:10.730 --> 03:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
to explore we explore it
 
03:14:12.349 --> 03:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
other hands on this side representative
 
03:14:12.359 --> 03:14:15.230 align:start position:0%
other hands on this side representative
Ames

03:14:15.230 --> 03:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.969 --> 03:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's good to see you yeah
 
03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
good seeing you
 
03:14:18.540 --> 03:14:19.490 align:start position:0%
good seeing you
um

03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
and we work together on this issue right
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
I I had two things one is um
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out there's another bill
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
that I filed that calls for our
 
03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
legislative study
 
03:14:38.690 --> 03:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
and that was actually a pickup from the
 
03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
work that you and I did on the
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
legislative Joint Committee that we both
 
03:14:47.769 --> 03:14:47.779 align:start position:0%
participated on along with with uh
 
03:14:47.779 --> 03:14:49.450 align:start position:0%
participated on along with with uh
representative

03:14:49.450 --> 03:14:49.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
Doucette do set sorry I know it but it
 
03:14:58.010 --> 03:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
didn't come up Fred scrolling
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
that wasn't there
 
03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
that wasn't there
um

03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
I hope you wouldn't be surprised that AI
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
filed it because all of a sudden you
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
weren't returning
 
03:15:12.530 --> 03:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I felt I knew this would be
 
03:15:14.450 --> 03:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
something you would want
 
03:15:17.630 --> 03:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
but b or second
 
03:15:21.170 --> 03:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
um would you be surprised that I agree
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
way to go forward is with this bill
 
03:15:32.210 --> 03:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
rather than with my my bill which is now
 
03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
retained by this committee so it can't
 
03:15:38.690 --> 03:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
be acted on until
 
03:15:42.290 --> 03:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
really until next year and we this bill
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
allows us to get going immediately yes
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
it gives us almost two years to work but
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
but a year and a half ish and uh
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
definitely it'll be broader than we'll
 
03:15:56.450 --> 03:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
have the right people at the table uh
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
talking through these issues uh it's
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's looking like they're going to allow
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
us some money to actually bring in other
 
03:16:03.650 --> 03:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
experts from afar
 
03:16:06.889 --> 03:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
to help us out so that's certainly a
 
03:16:08.450 --> 03:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
different thing than a joint committee
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh would be able to do
 
03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then on the money question and
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
the commission question
 
03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:18.050 align:start position:0%
the commission question
um

03:16:18.050 --> 03:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:20.809 --> 03:16:20.819 align:start position:0%
the one of the key differences between
 
03:16:24.170 --> 03:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
my bill and this bill is on those two
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
points there's no money in my bill and
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
there's a narrower narrower group of
 
03:16:34.490 --> 03:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
people because it's restricted to house
 
03:16:37.490 --> 03:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
members and Senate members
 
03:16:37.500 --> 03:16:41.330 align:start position:0%
members and Senate members
um

03:16:41.330 --> 03:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.340 --> 03:16:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
I can say that it has been my experience
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
much less than yours
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a member of a commission which I led
 
03:16:54.050 --> 03:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
on the casinos yes you did
 
03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:54.769 align:start position:0%
on the casinos yes you did
um

03:16:54.769 --> 03:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that having an appropriation having
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
money to get experts in made a huge
 
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
difference and would you agree that one
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties with you and I faced
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
on that legislative joint committee was
 
03:17:12.889 --> 03:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have that kind of support
 
03:17:16.130 --> 03:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
you know we as a constant scramble in
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the work we do here in the legislature
 
03:17:20.330 --> 03:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
to find enough time for anything to
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
focus on anything and without help it
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
makes it that much more difficult so
 
03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:28.730 align:start position:0%
makes it that much more difficult so
um

03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:31.490 --> 03:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
maybe you could flesh out a little bit
 
03:17:33.889 --> 03:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
how you would see the money being
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
helpful to this commission and making a
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
difference making it able to make a
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
greater difference than it would
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
otherwise be again it's the it's the
 
03:17:46.130 --> 03:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
ability to uh
 
03:17:48.889 --> 03:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
you know the travel issue for experts uh
 
03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
We've pretty much conquered that by
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
using Zoom I've done commissions now to
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
review Skype review Zoom uh you know to
 
03:17:59.630 --> 03:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
bring in people from other states and
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
I've I've kind of uh I think I was the
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
first one of the first legislators to uh
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
to get permission to do that on a
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
commission to you know when I was doing
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission I couldn't I
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't bring in people from California
 
03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
or Colorado we just didn't have the
 
03:18:15.170 --> 03:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
budget to fly people in and they're not
 
03:18:16.510 --> 03:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
going to come on their own
 
03:18:19.130 --> 03:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh Maine and Massachusetts came to us
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
because they're fairly local but
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
sometimes there were experts uh that
 
03:18:26.290 --> 03:18:26.300 align:start position:0%
we'd all love to hear from on issues
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that uh we're not able to bring in but
 
03:18:30.769 --> 03:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
with with zoom these days as long as
 
03:18:33.290 --> 03:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to use the zoom uh it it
 
03:18:37.309 --> 03:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
works okay uh but I think the other
 
03:18:39.530 --> 03:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
thing we can do is you know technically
 
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that Lottery has
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
inspectors okay so they do inspect these
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
facilities periodically as to their
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
practices and all of that the one
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
question I have is I mean I I'm sure
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
they have outside Auditors auditing
 
03:19:00.230 --> 03:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
their books
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
because one question I've always had is
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh is is I have no reason to believe
 
03:19:09.410 --> 03:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
this okay but I'm saying as you just
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
saying well why do we have audits well
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're protecting the
 
03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:13.730 align:start position:0%
you're you're protecting the
shareholders

03:19:13.730 --> 03:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
shareholders
 
03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
but in a way the the the the the
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh shareholders in part now are the
 
03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh shareholders in part now are the
charities

03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
charities
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
you know if we write them if we write a
 
03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
charity a check for sixty five thousand
 
03:19:25.500 --> 03:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
charity a check for sixty five thousand
dollars

03:19:26.690 --> 03:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:19:29.929 --> 03:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
and they get and but they really do 70
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
000 are they really going to complain no
 
03:19:34.010 --> 03:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
the books are good you know and I and
 
03:19:40.250 --> 03:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things I do want to
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
take up in the commission uh that that
 
03:19:46.490 --> 03:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
issue uh that we can all feel
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable again there's no reason I
 
03:19:49.790 --> 03:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
have no reason to believe
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem I'm just saying
 
03:19:54.250 --> 03:19:54.260 align:start position:0%
but doesn't mean you shouldn't check
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
so uh that's one thing I mean maybe we
 
03:19:59.330 --> 03:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
have we bring in another uh possible
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
thing is to bring in a uh uh some kind
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
of an accountant that could just do some
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
random checks on on some of the books uh
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
just to see so uh so yeah I think we'll
 
03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
find use of the money uh and we'll you
 
03:20:17.210 --> 03:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
know it'll be up to the commission we'll
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
be discussing that as to how how best is
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
to spend that money
 
03:20:21.300 --> 03:20:23.650 align:start position:0%
to spend that money
um

03:20:23.650 --> 03:20:23.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the things I want to
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
mention I almost forgot
 
03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
was I guess there's been a rule change
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
since for this year where a certain
 
03:20:36.769 --> 03:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
percentage of commission members have to
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
be legislators
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
so this is forced to get to get the
 
03:20:43.969 --> 03:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
number of of
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it's just a center
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
rule because I know the Senate was two
 
03:20:49.610 --> 03:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
two things that I've testified on so far
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
I had a higher number of of uh of reps
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
than normal
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
this one calls for five reps
 
03:20:58.010 --> 03:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
and two senators
 
03:21:01.370 --> 03:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh which is great if you know usually
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
members like to participate in these
 
03:21:05.690 --> 03:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
things uh but sometimes it's hard you
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
know we always have trouble getting two
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
senators period let alone let alone one
 
03:21:13.490 --> 03:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh so uh I just pointed out that there's
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
some kind of a new rule and I don't know
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
if that rule is also in the house or not
 
03:21:18.889 --> 03:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
someone know that answer I I don't know
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
but there's a senate rule because they
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
made a big deal about it
 
03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate when this bill was
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
being heard in the Senate it was less
 
03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
there was four reps someone did the math
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
said nope we need to have five reps so
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
just be aware we have to find and it
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
probably come from ways of means I don't
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
know what other committee they would
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
come from
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's asking for for five reps so
 
03:21:43.550 --> 03:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a change
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
usually we do three
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
three and two and then we we get one
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
from the Senate we're happy
 
03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:52.090 align:start position:0%
from the Senate we're happy
so

03:21:52.090 --> 03:21:52.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:54.889 --> 03:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'm not sure
 
03:22:01.490 --> 03:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
this is Jermaine to now and maybe a
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
conversation to have at another time but
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
I am curious about
 
03:22:09.889 --> 03:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
um commission membership this came up
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
several months ago when we were talking
 
03:22:15.410 --> 03:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
about Water's Edge business taxes uh
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
where there was a commission that didn't
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
have members and so it it's work hadn't
 
03:22:23.570 --> 03:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
gotten even started and I'm just
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if at some point somebody can
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
enlighten me and maybe others about what
 
03:22:30.050 --> 03:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
happens with commissions that aren't
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
if this is the same commission that I
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
was sharing
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh that it was an odd it was an oddly
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
written commission that crossed
 
03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
written commission that crossed
legislative

03:22:47.630 --> 03:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh sessions if you will
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
it went across after an elect you know
 
03:22:54.889 --> 03:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
it's it's one thing to have a two-year
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
commission when you have it when you
 
03:22:57.769 --> 03:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
form it the first year of the two years
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
because the house members are all the
 
03:23:01.870 --> 03:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
house members
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
Senator spellsbury are we talking about
 
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
the same one Let's help me out is this
 
03:23:09.050 --> 03:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
the same one uh yes just to clarify same
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
commission and I believe representative
 
03:23:13.450 --> 03:23:13.460 align:start position:0%
elberger's point is that there are some
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
non-legislative positions that never
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
were filled oh yes right some vacancies
 
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
right I got it but but again that was an
 
03:23:23.330 --> 03:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
odd one at a crossed lines so I
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
basically handed off to Baton to
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury who was an
 
03:23:29.330 --> 03:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
active member on that that commission to
 
03:23:29.340 --> 03:23:30.349 align:start position:0%
active member on that that commission to
be

03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:23:32.690 --> 03:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
I anointed him to chair at least to call
 
03:23:34.210 --> 03:23:34.220 align:start position:0%
the next meeting
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then but when I talked to the folks
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
up on the fourth floor they said it was
 
03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
odd that this this commission actually
 
03:23:46.610 --> 03:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
went across congrats legislative
 
03:23:50.809 --> 03:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
uh years uh that so
 
03:23:50.819 --> 03:23:51.950 align:start position:0%
uh years uh that so
uh

03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:55.250 --> 03:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
but yes we had trouble
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
filling all the seats I was in the
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
process of I had uh reached out to a few
 
03:23:59.939 --> 03:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
process of I had uh reached out to a few
others

03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:24:03.410 --> 03:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
and then when I didn't get reelected I
 
03:24:06.530 --> 03:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
kind of stopped doing that uh yes so yes
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we do have trouble uh getting
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
them it's up to the uh who who appoints
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
those it's the clerk's office
 
03:24:18.250 --> 03:24:18.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's the uh
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the clerk's office who has to
 
03:24:20.939 --> 03:24:21.950 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the clerk's office who has to
call

03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
the various like uh the uh
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the association of accountants or
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be they'll call and
 
03:24:33.290 --> 03:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
say hey we have this commission can you
 
03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
help us out can you find someone to to
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
fill that position that's what happens
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
and I kept on going back to the because
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
I held off starting the meeting because
 
03:24:44.570 --> 03:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
I I eventually I got a few more people
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
this was the hardest one ever because it
 
03:24:50.030 --> 03:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
was a very very technical
 
03:24:52.090 --> 03:24:52.100 align:start position:0%
kind of a topic
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
and it was hard to fill all those seats
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
with the right the right people that
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
were knowledgeable
 
03:25:00.410 --> 03:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh so and I don't know where it stands
 
03:25:03.050 --> 03:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
today but uh you know that's basically
 
03:25:05.090 --> 03:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
the back story on that but it's declared
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's the clerk's office when it comes to
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
house members
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the speakers the speaker's
 
03:25:13.610 --> 03:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
office gets the list
 
03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
speakers people will will appoint and
 
03:25:18.170 --> 03:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
usually the chair they'll usually call
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
the chair and ask for of the committee
 
03:25:22.969 --> 03:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
and say hey who do you suggest
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh for the committee so
 
03:25:28.969 --> 03:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much wait are we good oh
 
03:25:30.830 --> 03:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative or sorry thank you madam
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my questions so
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
just a couple things on the first page
 
03:25:37.250 --> 03:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
on line 19 it talks about whether
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
charging rent to Charities is necessary
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
with historic horse racing we've heard
 
03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony I guess some of
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
the Halls charged by the head five
 
03:25:48.050 --> 03:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
dollars or you know I guess that's a
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
rent so what is the question with
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing I'm not sure
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
well with historic horse racing
 
03:25:58.130 --> 03:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
these facilities are getting a lot more
 
03:25:58.140 --> 03:26:00.469 align:start position:0%
these facilities are getting a lot more
Revenue

03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.990 --> 03:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
and where basically the question is do
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
we really need to charge the Charities
 
03:26:04.739 --> 03:26:05.809 align:start position:0%
we really need to charge the Charities
rent

03:26:05.809 --> 03:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
rent
 
03:26:07.490 --> 03:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
I always had a problem with with
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
personally even before historic racing
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
charging the Charities rent now that the
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
philosophy behind the rent
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know it used to be in the old
 
03:26:19.380 --> 03:26:20.510 align:start position:0%
uh you know it used to be in the old
days

03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
let me
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming used to be
 
03:26:26.750 --> 03:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the gambling company would
 
03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
come with the roulette wheel and go to
 
03:26:31.370 --> 03:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
the basement of the church and you would
 
03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a charitable function somewhere
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
along the line before my time someone
 
03:26:37.250 --> 03:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
had the bright idea saying well why
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't we have fixed locations
 
03:26:40.490 --> 03:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is about so now
 
03:26:42.290 --> 03:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's fixed locations now there's 16
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:48.349 align:start position:0%
um and uh
so

03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
in those days in the beginning the
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
Charities actually had to do something
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
they actually had to come and actually
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
participate and touch the money
 
03:26:59.929 --> 03:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
which was not a good idea but over time
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's morphed now into all they have to
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
do is sign a piece of paper somewhere
 
03:27:07.610 --> 03:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
along the line and pick up the check
 
03:27:11.450 --> 03:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh so the so the operator said well wait
 
03:27:12.530 --> 03:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
a minute we're doing all the work for
 
03:27:14.090 --> 03:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
you that we used to do
 
03:27:16.250 --> 03:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
so we're going to charge you rent
 
03:27:18.010 --> 03:27:18.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line that happened
 
03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
and now the question on the table is
 
03:27:23.570 --> 03:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
is that really necessary given that
 
03:27:26.809 --> 03:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
we've we've passed historic horse racing
 
03:27:28.729 --> 03:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
which is is increasing everybody's
 
03:27:31.010 --> 03:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue Charities and the locations is
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
it really fair to continue to charge the
 
03:27:35.269 --> 03:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
Charities event so that's why that
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of why that
 
03:27:39.170 --> 03:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
one's on the same list thank you and
 
03:27:40.450 --> 03:27:40.460 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:27:45.889 --> 03:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh online same page line 23 it says uh
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
additional licenses for historical horse
 
03:27:50.150 --> 03:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
racing machines would increase or reduce
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
revenues to Charities did you have a
 
03:27:54.590 --> 03:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
chance to look into that enough to
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
determine if there was an impact on
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
other charities
 
03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
you know so we're on line 20 what 20
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's line 24 23 and 4.
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
additional license for HHR machines
 
03:28:10.849 --> 03:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
would increase or reduce revenues to
 
03:28:10.859 --> 03:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
would increase or reduce revenues to
charity

03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
charity
 
03:28:13.490 --> 03:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if you'd gotten into
 
03:28:16.010 --> 03:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
enough to have any feel for whether or
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
not there were any impacts one way or
 
03:28:17.819 --> 03:28:19.670 align:start position:0%
not there were any impacts one way or
another

03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:28:21.530 --> 03:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
well I've been in contact with a lot of
 
03:28:23.450 --> 03:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming locations
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
and they're all picking up new Charities
 
03:28:26.929 --> 03:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
because what we did
 
03:28:29.809 --> 03:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
first off is in the bill the historic
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
cost facing bill
 
03:28:32.929 --> 03:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
we our goal was to double the number
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
charity because one of the big
 
03:28:35.630 --> 03:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
complaints we heard from charities
 
03:28:38.929 --> 03:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
is that we can never get a date all the
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
dates are are taken there's like about
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
500 Charities that were taking part in
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
in charitable gaming
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
so we said we're gonna if we're gonna do
 
03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
historic racing we're going to help out
 
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
we want to help out other charities
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
and we basically so every every date has
 
03:28:55.550 --> 03:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
two Charities now that if you have
 
03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines you have two
 
03:28:59.090 --> 03:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
day two Charities involved and the money
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
split so uh
 
03:29:06.290 --> 03:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and I've been to the
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
brook uh for an event I've been to uh
 
03:29:11.690 --> 03:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester for another event
 
03:29:14.090 --> 03:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
talking to the owners there and they've
 
03:29:16.130 --> 03:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
all said that yeah they're having no
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
problem finding additional charities
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you know the goal is we can get up
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
to around a thousand Charities if we
 
03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
double okay so I don't know if that was
 
03:29:25.729 --> 03:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
your question but yes no that's good and
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
just keep me in mind if you need an
 
03:29:30.050 --> 03:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
auditor as an auditor for a number of
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
years and I figure you're 250 000 just
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
might cover my fees believe me it's not
 
03:29:37.729 --> 03:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
mine I didn't write the bill I probably
 
03:29:39.410 --> 03:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have written for 250 in it
 
03:29:42.050 --> 03:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
because it's my fiscal conservative side
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
of tech I really want to spend 250 of
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
them so but not the more I think about
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
it it's probably not a bad idea so
 
03:29:52.429 --> 03:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh sorry
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd hopefully a very
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
03:29:57.290 --> 03:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so I'm seeing in here that there
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
would be two representatives of
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming Charities
 
03:30:04.490 --> 03:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just kind of curious you may
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
not be the person to ask this question
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
of but who how are those Charities
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
chosen I mean given my non-profit work I
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
worked for non-profits that are 10
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
people I've worked with non-profits that
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
are 8 000 people so like yeah
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there would be very different right I
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
mean that's a that's a good that's a
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
good question I'm not sure how we're
 
03:30:22.560 --> 03:30:23.570 align:start position:0%
good question I'm not sure how we're
gonna

03:30:23.570 --> 03:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know on the on the owner's side
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have the same question
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
although there's there's some
 
03:30:33.050 --> 03:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
consolidation going on in that
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the owners are now
 
03:30:37.969 --> 03:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
buying out some of the other locations
 
03:30:41.150 --> 03:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay so but there's an association
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
that you know but look the language is
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
the language uh we'd have to figure out
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I I would imagine that the uh we
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
should give some advice to the
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh clerk's office when they're reaching
 
03:30:54.720 --> 03:30:55.429 align:start position:0%
uh clerk's office when they're reaching
out

03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:30:58.490 --> 03:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
to what charities maybe we'll Define the
 
03:31:00.170 --> 03:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
bigger chair maybe one big charity one
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
small charity or something like that but
 
03:31:03.950 --> 03:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good find that's a good that's
 
03:31:06.170 --> 03:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
a good question again I I you know I saw
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bill the first time when it was in
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
the Senate but
 
03:31:10.140 --> 03:31:11.090 align:start position:0%
the Senate but
um

03:31:11.090 --> 03:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.760 --> 03:31:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:31:16.610 --> 03:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you that just brought up a
 
03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
question for me on have we got something
 
03:31:24.410 --> 03:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
in the law that says that the owner has
 
03:31:27.849 --> 03:31:27.859 align:start position:0%
to be from New Hampshire because my uh
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
Paul which is going to be a lot bigger
 
03:31:33.050 --> 03:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
soon is
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
um has been bought out by a group in
 
03:31:40.809 --> 03:31:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:43.370 --> 03:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
one has to be a resident of New
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes right is there
 
03:31:46.849 --> 03:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
is there sure that it's the New
 
03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people that end up yeah I I
 
03:31:49.200 --> 03:31:50.269 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people that end up yeah I I
guess

03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:31:52.250 --> 03:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
we do have um
 
03:31:52.260 --> 03:31:53.630 align:start position:0%
we do have um
again

03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:31:56.690 --> 03:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
the one that we yield to uh is the
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
commission is going to have somebody
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
from the AG's office Attorney General
 
03:32:02.570 --> 03:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
um and those are the kind of questions
 
03:32:05.210 --> 03:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to focus on
 
03:32:07.490 --> 03:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
what happened that that that's all being
 
03:32:08.690 --> 03:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
done right
 
03:32:12.050 --> 03:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the one big issue for me was
 
03:32:14.269 --> 03:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh the one thing we did find uh
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ames uh and uh to set was
 
03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:20.389 align:start position:0%
representative Ames uh and uh to set was
um

03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:22.969 --> 03:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
how did the Charities get picked
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know is there favoritism I mean is
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
it how do you get how who who gets first
 
03:32:32.450 --> 03:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
priority but believe me when when organs
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
when Charities learn about charitable
 
03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
gaming and as many of them know about
 
03:32:35.279 --> 03:32:36.530 align:start position:0%
gaming and as many of them know about
this

03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:32:38.809 --> 03:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
they're all salivate because be honest
 
03:32:40.490 --> 03:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
with you the bigger places now
 
03:32:42.170 --> 03:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're walking away with checks for a
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
03:32:47.330 --> 03:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
so we're talking big money too so uh so
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
03:32:51.710 --> 03:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
and then in our interviews that was one
 
03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we've always asked
 
03:32:56.330 --> 03:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
was how do you how do you pick how do
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
you prioritize with Charities and they
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
all kind of had different methodologies
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
I know when we were at the brook uh we
 
03:33:05.690 --> 03:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
met with the owner
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
and he had a good answer he goes well we
 
03:33:11.809 --> 03:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
do what we're doing is that after every
 
03:33:11.819 --> 03:33:13.250 align:start position:0%
do what we're doing is that after every
year

03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh they they're going to ask how did the
 
03:33:18.650 --> 03:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
charity spend the money
 
03:33:21.769 --> 03:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
they want to know how specifically each
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
charity spent the money
 
03:33:25.490 --> 03:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh and that would guide them as to
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
are you know there are a lot of
 
03:33:29.870 --> 03:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards in there you have to wait a
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
year uh you can't be a charity that just
 
03:33:34.610 --> 03:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden opened up shop and asked
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
to open a historic charitable gaming
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
location you have to you have to wait a
 
03:33:38.819 --> 03:33:39.469 align:start position:0%
location you have to you have to wait a
year

03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me back back up that you you
 
03:33:44.929 --> 03:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
can't just be in the Charity saying I
 
03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
want to I want to be uh considered
 
03:33:52.250 --> 03:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh used me too that got changed to one
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a year waiting period we
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
just don't want Charities popping up
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere saying hey we're a charity
 
03:34:01.929 --> 03:34:01.939 align:start position:0%
with no track record
 
03:34:04.370 --> 03:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
so you see the more we talk about this
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
issue there's a lot of subtleties that I
 
03:34:07.729 --> 03:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
know are going to come up in this
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
commission to make sure that it's as
 
03:34:11.330 --> 03:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
tight as can be and that's that's what
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.410 --> 03:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh one more
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
um I had a bill that recently passed the
 
03:34:27.410 --> 03:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
house in the Senate it was a study
 
03:34:27.420 --> 03:34:28.610 align:start position:0%
house in the Senate it was a study
committee

03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
but it had representative it had people
 
03:34:34.849 --> 03:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
03:34:34.859 --> 03:34:36.110 align:start position:0%
on the committee
um

03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
let me start again
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
one of the things I know about study
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
commissions versus committees is that it
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
can take a long time to get it set up
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
because you have to select people from
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
outside the legislature and when I
 
03:34:52.010 --> 03:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned that to OLS when I was
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
drafting a bill for a study committee
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
and I told him that I wanted it to be a
 
03:34:58.729 --> 03:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
committee but I thought I had to make it
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
a commission because of that issue what
 
03:35:03.650 --> 03:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
they did is they put together a
 
03:35:06.050 --> 03:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
committee and voting members were just
 
03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
housing House and Senate representative
 
03:35:10.969 --> 03:35:10.979 align:start position:0%
is there a question here yes relevant
 
03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
then within that um
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill it's said that certain agencies
 
03:35:22.190 --> 03:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
would provide expertise to the um to the
 
03:35:24.370 --> 03:35:24.380 align:start position:0%
committee including sometimes
 
03:35:27.410 --> 03:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
identifying specific
 
03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
um people you know positions within the
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
government so I'm concerned about what
 
03:35:34.610 --> 03:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
kind of decision you're going to get
 
03:35:37.250 --> 03:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
from this commission when you have
 
03:35:40.130 --> 03:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
voting members that are Facility Owners
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
in charity in representing Charities and
 
03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
that just to get I know it's putting you
 
03:35:47.929 --> 03:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
on the spot but to get your reaction to
 
03:35:50.690 --> 03:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
somehow restructuring this to be a
 
03:35:52.910 --> 03:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee with just
 
03:35:56.210 --> 03:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
senators and representatives voting but
 
03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
identifying people that should assist
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
them you know representatives of
 
03:36:07.610 --> 03:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
Charities or something along that line
 
03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's different kind of commissions
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
too I mean so the fact that we have them
 
03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
at the table
 
03:36:14.819 --> 03:36:15.769 align:start position:0%
at the table
um

03:36:15.769 --> 03:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
gives them the feeling that
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
they are participating that they are at
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
the table
 
03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
the table
uh

03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:26.210 --> 03:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
let me give you I I've chaired a couple
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
of commissions on um
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
on uh the assessing of utility
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
properties as some of the federal
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
members know I talk about telephone Paul
 
03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
electric poles all the time
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
but I needed everybody in the room
 
03:36:41.929 --> 03:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
because I needed the I needed the
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the room I needed the
 
03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the room I needed the
uh

03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:47.389 align:start position:0%
uh
um

03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.849 --> 03:36:48.859 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
utility companies in the room and I
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
needed the assess assessing
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
organizations in the room
 
03:36:57.410 --> 03:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
because my goal was to fix a problem
 
03:36:59.210 --> 03:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
that that commission was fixing a
 
03:37:01.610 --> 03:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
problem and the goal was to get them all
 
03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:02.819 align:start position:0%
in the room and bang their heads
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
together I started that meeting by
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
saying do all does anybody in the room
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
think there's no problem
 
03:37:09.050 --> 03:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
and everybody said no that's a problem
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
so good we're going to fix the problem
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
so that's one kind of commission
 
03:37:13.800 --> 03:37:15.710 align:start position:0%
so that's one kind of commission
um

03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:18.050 --> 03:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
I mean there there are others but I
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
think it's important uh that we have now
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the marijuana commission what
 
03:37:23.570 --> 03:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
happened at the end
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
is that some of the agencies that we had
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
but we had Health and Human Services we
 
03:37:30.170 --> 03:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
had State Police we had others on the
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
commission there was 17 members
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
all are very helpful very people
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
perspective we had all these
 
03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:36.229 align:start position:0%
perspective we had all these
perspectives

03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
but what happened at the end
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
they had trouble signing off on the
 
03:37:42.239 --> 03:37:43.250 align:start position:0%
they had trouble signing off on the
report

03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:37:43.260 --> 03:37:44.630 align:start position:0%
report
because

03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't want
 
03:37:48.410 --> 03:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
they didn't want their agencies to be
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
saying that they support or not support
 
03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
so we had a disclaimer in the report
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
they said this this is no way represents
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
the uh feelings of Health and Human
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
Services or something that affect okay
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we that's why we did that
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
but it was it was very helpful to have
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
them at the table though so
 
03:38:08.330 --> 03:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:38:10.130 --> 03:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
would keep it as a commission so we
 
03:38:13.450 --> 03:38:13.460 align:start position:0%
could get I don't think
 
03:38:16.729 --> 03:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
first off again I think just having them
 
03:38:20.330 --> 03:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
at the table is important to get their
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
perspective have them be able to speak
 
03:38:24.889 --> 03:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
up at any time
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
how they feel about whatever the issue
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and then we'll just
 
03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.220 --> 03:38:33.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:36.899 align:start position:0%

03:40:18.010 --> 03:40:18.020 align:start position:0%
noted before we have very small
 
03:40:18.020 --> 03:40:19.870 align:start position:0%
noted before we have very small
community

03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%

organizations
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
um of our members some not all
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
participate in charitable gaming and are
 
03:40:39.410 --> 03:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
interested in issues that are uh noted
 
03:40:42.410 --> 03:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
in this proposal including the selection
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
process issues around rental fees and so
 
03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
we'd like to ask your committee to
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
consider adding the New Hampshire Center
 
03:40:54.050 --> 03:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
for non-profits to this proposed study
 
03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
commission the New Hampshire Center for
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits has partnered on commissions
 
03:41:02.210 --> 03:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
has also partnered with the governor's
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
office for emergency relief and recovery
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
on issues related to the pandemic we are
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
one of the partner organizations that
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
helped administer
 
03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
resources related to the pandemic we
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
also provided some survey work some
 
03:41:23.210 --> 03:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
pulse survey work the center puts out a
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
number of reports
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
including annual wage and benefit
 
03:41:28.969 --> 03:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
reports and I think we see this
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide scope and really understand
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
the needs of the nonprofit sector as you
 
03:41:37.729 --> 03:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire the nonprofit
 
03:41:40.490 --> 03:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
sector is integral to our state's
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
well-being in many communities uh the uh
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
particularly social services play a role
 
03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
that perhaps in other states would be
 
03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
held by government so we're really
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
integral into
 
03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:53.809 align:start position:0%
integral into
um

03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh delivering services and the
 
03:41:57.650 --> 03:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
well-being of our community and we'd
 
03:41:58.849 --> 03:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
really like to be part of this

Association
um

03:42:29.690 --> 03:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:33.969 --> 03:42:33.979 align:start position:0%
we support this bill we support of the
 
03:42:36.650 --> 03:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
continuation of studying charity gaming
 
03:42:39.050 --> 03:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
through the commission and we support
 
03:42:41.809 --> 03:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
the a two-year extension of the
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium I just quickly will want to
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
make a point that Senator Lang said when
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally passed to allow
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
historic racing it was anticipated that
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
the eligible rooms would have
 
03:42:59.570 --> 03:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
three years where they would have the
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ramp up and get
 
03:43:04.090 --> 03:43:04.100 align:start position:0%
established and as we know currently
 
03:43:07.490 --> 03:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
seven of the 15 eligible locations still
 
03:43:09.769 --> 03:43:09.779 align:start position:0%
do not have historic Racing for various
 
03:43:09.779 --> 03:43:11.150 align:start position:0%
do not have historic Racing for various
reasons

03:43:11.150 --> 03:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
um but so we think that it's appropriate
 
03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
to extend this moratorium out uh two
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
years and give those rooms that
 
03:43:19.439 --> 03:43:21.110 align:start position:0%
years and give those rooms that
opportunity

03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:21.769 align:start position:0%
opportunity
um

03:43:21.769 --> 03:43:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:24.889 --> 03:43:24.899 align:start position:0%
and that completes my testimony
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
I actually have a technical question so
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
does this get rid of another study
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
commission that was in effect I believe
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
it repeals the study commission that's
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
being established
 
03:43:38.210 --> 03:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the dates right isn't
 
03:43:38.220 --> 03:43:38.929 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the dates right isn't
it

03:43:38.929 --> 03:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's creating the study
 
03:43:43.250 --> 03:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
commission and then two years it repeals
 
03:43:47.150 --> 03:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
it ah okay gotcha just just seeing what
 
03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
was going on with that just trying to
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
understand okay any questions for Mr
 
03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:52.490 align:start position:0%
understand okay any questions for Mr
Newman

03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%

we will open the public hearing on
 
03:44:14.990 --> 03:44:15.000 align:start position:0%

Lang

03:44:27.969 --> 03:44:27.979 align:start position:0%
Lang
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I won't give
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
my introduction again I'll just go right
 
03:44:35.330 --> 03:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
into the bill so Senate Bill 120 uh is
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill you've already heard
 
03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
which is house bill
 
03:44:40.370 --> 03:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
um 607.
 
03:44:41.570 --> 03:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
um the short version of what this bill
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
does it extends licenses from an annual
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
process to a three-year process without
 
03:44:49.150 --> 03:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
changing a licensing fee
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
it also but it requires an annual
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
reporting of change so if there is a
 
03:44:56.210 --> 03:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
change if there's no change there's no
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
need to report but if there is a change
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
he gain the gaming operators would have
 
03:45:03.290 --> 03:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
to file a an amended or the amended
 
03:45:05.090 --> 03:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
information with Lottery
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
um it just takes away the licensing
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
requirement that that becomes an annual
 
03:45:10.490 --> 03:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
event and make it a three-year licensing
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
event the other thing this bill does is
 
03:45:16.130 --> 03:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
increase the Wagers again similar to the
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 607 except that my Stakes are
 
03:45:23.330 --> 03:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
a little higher you guys passed 25 for a
 
03:45:25.250 --> 03:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
wager this bill is fifty dollars per
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
wager so I want to talk a little bit
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
about that about why that number went up
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
so dramatically and why I support that
 
03:45:33.889 --> 03:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
idea of that number so you heard from
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
the Charities one of the first things is
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
that Charities are seeing a reduction in
 
03:45:38.279 --> 03:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
that Charities are seeing a reduction in
giving

03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
giving
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
um in our in our state this is a way of
 
03:45:42.239 --> 03:45:43.429 align:start position:0%
um in our in our state this is a way of
again

03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:45:43.439 --> 03:45:44.030 align:start position:0%
again
um

03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:46.490 --> 03:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
of of allowing more money to flow into
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that results in more
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
money going to Charities by raising it
 
03:45:53.090 --> 03:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
up to fifty dollars the other aspect you
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
heard uh earlier from uh I think was
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
Rick Newman talking about how much he
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
pays dealers right the ability for an
 
03:46:03.650 --> 03:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
operator to be able to raise wages is
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
directly related to the amount of money
 
03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
they take in they don't take the money
 
03:46:08.150 --> 03:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
in they can't raise the wages for their
 
03:46:10.610 --> 03:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
employees and so this bill will allow
 
03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
The Operators on the operator side to
 
03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
make more Revenue to be able to increase
 
03:46:16.010 --> 03:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
salaries for the workforce that is
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
currently existing you heard earlier
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
there are 1500 employees in a charitable
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
gaming industry this will allow the
 
03:46:24.410 --> 03:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators more Revenue
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
to be able to raise the wages for the
 
03:46:28.130 --> 03:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
salary for those workers
 
03:46:28.140 --> 03:46:29.809 align:start position:0%
salary for those workers
um

03:46:29.809 --> 03:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
the other reason why this this bill was
 
03:46:34.610 --> 03:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
put in was we now have some competition
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
both to the to the west of uh to the
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
east of us and to the south of us that
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have over in Maine the New Oxford
 
03:46:43.190 --> 03:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
Casino which is on the main border and
 
03:46:44.929 --> 03:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
we have in Massachusetts in Boston The
 
03:46:47.690 --> 03:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
Encore casino and and over in the
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
western edge of the state in Springfield
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
we got MGM so understand that our gaming
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
operators are competing for game for
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
gamblers for people who want to want to
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
come in and play and if uh on a Friday
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
and Saturday night if a game if a person
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
interested in in participating is
 
03:47:08.809 --> 03:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
offered the choice of going to Boston
 
03:47:10.610 --> 03:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
for where they have a higher bet limit
 
03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
as compared to New Hampshire and they're
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
a serious poker player they're going to
 
03:47:16.490 --> 03:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
go to where the money is and go down to
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
Boston so the goal of raising these
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
another goal of this is to retain the
 
03:47:23.690 --> 03:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
money that's coming to New Hampshire in
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also understand again
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
we also attend attract Massachusetts
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
residents to also come up because our
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
gaming our gaming operations are on par
 
03:47:35.450 --> 03:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
with Massachusetts gaming operations and
 
03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
we're not at we're not working at a
 
03:47:39.130 --> 03:47:39.140 align:start position:0%
deficit right off the bat
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does not contain and 607 is
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
where your moratorium bill was you had a
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
moratorium on historic horse racing I
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
chose to break that out and put it into
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
its own separate bill which we just
 
03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:51.110 align:start position:0%
its own separate bill which we just
heard

03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
um rather than include it as part of
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions again but I
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
think as I spoke to earlier all of these
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
bills were looked at holistically in
 
03:48:04.610 --> 03:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
providing the best opportunity for
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming to stay competitive in
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
our state to be able to keep the the
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
gaming operators in business and working
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
and be able to work with their employees
 
03:48:16.250 --> 03:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
and their Charities as well
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
wow seeing none oh you're awesome
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative Pillsbury
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
with apologies for uh keeping you
 
03:48:31.920 --> 03:48:32.750 align:start position:0%
with apologies for uh keeping you
um

03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:35.929 --> 03:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
I raised this question on 607 when we
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
got to exec and had not been present
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
during the hearing so I'll raise it
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
again with you in this bill
 
03:48:47.469 --> 03:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
both bills delete
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
a substantial language
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:04.969 --> 03:49:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
is a section that relates to penalties
 
03:49:13.010 --> 03:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
and it's divided into a part a
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
and a Part B
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh curiously there is a part C and uh HP
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
607 had all three of them
 
03:49:25.570 --> 03:49:25.580 align:start position:0%
in each case the current law
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
lists specific
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
instances that would constitute under a
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
a minor violation under B A moderate
 
03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:36.779 align:start position:0%
violation and under C
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
a major violation
 
03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:43.070 align:start position:0%
a major violation
and

03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.889 --> 03:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
each of those also includes language
 
03:49:49.130 --> 03:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
that says may include but is not limited
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
to so that the Lottery Commission
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
would find in these specific instances a
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
violation according to the tier of
 
03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:00.410 align:start position:0%
violation according to the tier of
severity

03:50:00.410 --> 03:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
severity
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
and could find others that aren't listed
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
that would be comparable
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
at the least this is indicative it
 
03:50:11.330 --> 03:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
the ability of the commission to find
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
other instances that are of commensurate
 
03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:19.790 align:start position:0%
other instances that are of commensurate
harm

03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
so my that sounds like a very good
 
03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:23.530 align:start position:0%
so my that sounds like a very good
convention

03:50:23.530 --> 03:50:23.540 align:start position:0%
convention
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
why are we deleting all that language
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me and what is it that we end up
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
with if we delete that language so my
 
03:50:35.929 --> 03:50:35.939 align:start position:0%
question to you is is why
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
and my I'll come back with a follow-up
 
03:50:41.809 --> 03:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for your question
 
03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
and so if I remember the conversation
 
03:50:45.410 --> 03:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
right about this section although this
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not something I'd follow my sword
 
03:50:48.290 --> 03:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
over if you want to add it back in I
 
03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
would be completely fine with that but I
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
think the reasoning was that we deal
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
with this in rules uh for the we deal
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
with it in rules for what is considered
 
03:50:58.130 --> 03:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
the minor and what is considered a a
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
moderate type of uh uh incident and it's
 
03:51:05.150 --> 03:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
more because
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
rules to a certain extent a little bit
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
easier process to deal with new
 
03:51:10.130 --> 03:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
instances and new things that come up
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
make an open rule making at a drop of a
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
hat and it goes on for six months in
 
03:51:14.929 --> 03:51:14.939 align:start position:0%
which case it's presented then to jail
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
car for the purposes of approving the
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
new rule so I think the idea was
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
especially considering the not limited
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
to language basically says it's anything
 
03:51:25.370 --> 03:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
anyway there's no read to put a list
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
into into statute what's the feeling
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator so
 
03:51:32.570 --> 03:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
I was wondering whether you had a
 
03:51:34.490 --> 03:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
specific reason and I'll ask the
 
03:51:36.830 --> 03:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
question again if I get a chance of the
 
03:51:38.330 --> 03:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission I'll ask the same
 
03:51:41.570 --> 03:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
thing but I would just uh ask this
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
question as a follow-up it seems to me
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
that if you read the language after all
 
03:51:48.290 --> 03:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
of this is eliminated you end up with
 
03:51:50.690 --> 03:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
three tautologies
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
so it then leaves you with a minor
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
violation shall be one dot dot dot where
 
03:51:59.150 --> 03:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
the harm is
 
03:51:59.160 --> 03:52:00.469 align:start position:0%
the harm is
minor

03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
minor
 
03:52:02.570 --> 03:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
a moderate violation is where the harm
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
is moderate
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
and so it seems that we leave it
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat unguided and I'm just wondering
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
if we left this language in would you
 
03:52:12.170 --> 03:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that as the
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor nope not a sword I'd die and
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
again I think it was because they wanted
 
03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
to deal with it in rules rather than in
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Rick Newman from New
 
03:52:40.130 --> 03:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
Rick Newman representing New Hampshire
 
03:52:45.769 --> 03:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators Association
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we do support the bill and
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
I understand this committee has passed a
 
03:52:55.450 --> 03:52:55.460 align:start position:0%
bill to increase the wager limit to 25
 
03:52:58.849 --> 03:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
and uh the Senate's taken the position
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
that it should be 50. we obviously
 
03:53:05.090 --> 03:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
support that this this um
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
we are in a very competitive environment
 
03:53:10.450 --> 03:53:10.460 align:start position:0%
as Senator Lang just said
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned earlier today
 
03:53:16.010 --> 03:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the post-covered world the casinos
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
around us are ramping up they're they're
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
doing uh getting back to where they were
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh pre-covered they're doing a lot of uh
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
promotions a lot of marketing and we see
 
03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:28.729 align:start position:0%
promotions a lot of marketing and we see
it

03:53:28.729 --> 03:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I passed out
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:53:36.410 --> 03:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh just a snapshot of for instance state
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
revenue it's the paper with the blue on
 
03:53:42.290 --> 03:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
the top and if you look at for instance
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
March of 2020
 
03:53:46.370 --> 03:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 2022
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
state revenue was 490 000 from uh games
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
of chance it's table games in poker 490
 
03:53:55.969 --> 03:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
000. and if you look at March of 23 it
 
03:54:00.170 --> 03:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
was 5 21. so essentially we're flat we
 
03:54:02.809 --> 03:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
should be up and the reason I know we
 
03:54:04.429 --> 03:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
should be up is because in the rooms
 
03:54:06.889 --> 03:54:06.899 align:start position:0%
that have historic horse racing the
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
games of chance Revenue has gone up
 
03:54:10.849 --> 03:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
fairly dramatically
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
um but for instance in Salem looking at
 
03:54:16.610 --> 03:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh look when I looked at March of this
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
year versus March of last year Salem
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
does not have a store course racing yet
 
03:54:24.370 --> 03:54:24.380 align:start position:0%
and there uh games with chance numbers
 
03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
were down by about 200 plus thousand
 
03:54:27.660 --> 03:54:28.729 align:start position:0%
were down by about 200 plus thousand
dollars

03:54:28.729 --> 03:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
total revenue so that tells me they're
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
losing business to the border and that
 
03:54:36.530 --> 03:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
tells me that that and if you look at
 
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
Seabrook the brook
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
Brooks games are chance numbers are
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically up uh because they do have
 
03:54:44.330 --> 03:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
a store course racing so they've
 
03:54:46.729 --> 03:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
attracted some business but overall
 
03:54:50.570 --> 03:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
games of chance are we're fairly flat we
 
03:54:53.330 --> 03:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
think a 50 wages will do just as Senator
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Lang said give us the opportunity to
 
03:54:57.229 --> 03:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
continue to grow grow money for
 
03:55:00.769 --> 03:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
Charities and uh obviously help support
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
our employees
 
03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
on the rest of the bill one thing I want
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
to point out because it was in 607 as
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we took note of it I
 
03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure you noted it in
 
03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's section 15 of this bill it makes
 
03:55:22.189 --> 03:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh it puts into the criminal code
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
a crime of cheating at charitable gaming
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
events that's not in the statute as of
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
now and there are times when people have
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
been caught cheating but local law
 
03:55:37.389 --> 03:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement has been reluctant to
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
make an arrest because it's not
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in the criminal code so
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
we're that that's the reason that that
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:50.090 --> 03:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
did you want to comment on the question
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
that representative spilsbury have why
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
why the change in the whole penalty
 
03:55:58.010 --> 03:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
description do you know where am I from
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
my recollection of that is um in fact
 
03:56:03.410 --> 03:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
the commission that uh or the committee
 
03:56:05.330 --> 03:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames and abrami were
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
on received from the lottery several
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
suggested changes in uh statute that was
 
03:56:13.729 --> 03:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
one of them so that that really came
 
03:56:16.610 --> 03:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
from them they wanted more flexibility
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
to be able to deal with uh penalties for
 
03:56:19.979 --> 03:56:21.469 align:start position:0%
to be able to deal with uh penalties for
violations

03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
violations
 
03:56:23.809 --> 03:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
so that that's really all I know about
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.010 --> 03:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions sure
 
03:56:31.610 --> 03:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.849 --> 03:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.610 --> 03:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
on have you
 
03:56:41.450 --> 03:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
mixed up the uh
 
03:56:43.610 --> 03:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
the chair the games of chance state
 
03:56:45.769 --> 03:56:45.779 align:start position:0%
revenue with the games of chance charity
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
allocation because we give the Charities
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
35 percent
 
03:56:59.330 --> 03:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:02.570 --> 03:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you ask that question
 
03:57:05.450 --> 03:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
again please yeah yeah on just to take
 
03:57:12.889 --> 03:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:15.889 --> 03:57:15.899 align:start position:0%
000 uh games of chance charity
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
allocation one million eight hundred and
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
twelve right
 
03:57:25.370 --> 03:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's not 35 that's 65 percent
 
03:57:26.809 --> 03:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
or more
 
03:57:28.729 --> 03:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
actually it's more than that no that
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
that seems about right to me actually
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's so if this games of chance state
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
revenue was 521 000 that would indicate
 
03:57:39.610 --> 03:57:39.620 align:start position:0%
to me that the total
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
gross Gaming revenue would have been 5.2
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
the charity should have gotten 35
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
percent of 5.2 million which off top my
 
03:57:52.250 --> 03:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
head seems like 1.8 is about right
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
the charts I've seen from Lottery have
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
got us taking the LIE and share of that
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
03:58:02.929 --> 03:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear you state taking
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
the 65 so that is on if you go to the
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
next line over historic horse racing
 
03:58:11.330 --> 03:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
state revenue
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's just that's just historic horse
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
racing that's just historic horse racing
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's charitable gaming correctly
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay so that's just historic horse
 
03:58:24.349 --> 03:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
racing and that is a they are the state
 
03:58:26.330 --> 03:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
and the charity
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
are allocated money for historic horse
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
racing differently than they are for
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
table games I know but I thought I was
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
remembering this from from charitable
 
03:58:37.490 --> 03:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
gaming days when we were a little bit
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.600 --> 03:58:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay I do
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
not have any other pink cards for Senate
 
03:58:51.769 --> 03:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
bill 120.
 
03:58:51.779 --> 03:58:55.689 align:start position:0%
bill 120.

welcome to Ways and Means sorry we

foreign

03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.490 --> 03:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Roy schweiker from Concord
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
I have I guess four General concerns
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill number one in the
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
analysis it says the betting limit on
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
table Stakes is 2500 but you know in the
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill itself it says however much money
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
you might have so if you won earlier you
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
might have more than 2500 and I don't
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
know if it's legal I haven't found
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
anything that says it isn't for players
 
03:59:59.929 --> 03:59:59.939 align:start position:0%
to pool their money so one player might
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
have you know thousands of dollars so
 
04:00:04.729 --> 04:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
you know that's just a concern you know
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
we may be talking even bigger money than
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
you think number two I'm not quite sure
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
why if everything is increasing under
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate people are number one
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
paying much lower fees and not having to
 
04:00:20.650 --> 04:00:20.660 align:start position:0%
relicense every year it just seems like
 
04:00:23.809 --> 04:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
with the increase in money you might
 
04:00:25.370 --> 04:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
want you know higher fees and more
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
controls rather than less
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
the third thing is I'm really concerned
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
about this you know right now charitable
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
gaming is kind of charitable gaming you
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
know people go out and play for the
 
04:00:37.849 --> 04:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
night you know you can't lose more money
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
than you might spend going to a major
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
league sporting event or out to a fancy
 
04:00:44.330 --> 04:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
restaurant or whatnot but now we're
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
making it a much larger sum of money
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
that someone can put in and
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know you could you may attract more
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers and more organized
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
crime figures I want to take over but
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to bother under
 
04:01:01.070 --> 04:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
the present you know daily limits and so
 
04:01:02.689 --> 04:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
I feel like let's give the
 
04:01:04.969 --> 04:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities an issue some say in here
 
04:01:07.130 --> 04:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
you know some municipality in the past
 
04:01:08.929 --> 04:01:08.939 align:start position:0%
has said okay you know we have
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming so the church can run
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
bingo games now somebody can come in and
 
04:01:14.809 --> 04:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
build a casino and they really have no
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
way of stopping it so I think that you
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
should allow the municipalities to set
 
04:01:22.490 --> 04:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
their own limits
 
04:01:24.410 --> 04:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know so long as they're greater than
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
the ones that exist so that ones that
 
04:01:28.729 --> 04:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
big poker players from all over coming
 
04:01:32.809 --> 04:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
in but only want people to play bingo at
 
04:01:34.670 --> 04:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
the local church have that opportunity
 
04:01:37.729 --> 04:01:37.739 align:start position:0%
and in line with that right now once
 
04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
again there seems to be an issue the
 
04:01:42.530 --> 04:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
operator essentially sets who what
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
charities get the money I don't know
 
04:01:46.130 --> 04:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
that they're limited to New Hampshire
 
04:01:47.929 --> 04:01:47.939 align:start position:0%
Charities or Charities anybody's ever
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
heard of they can set up their own
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
captive Charities so I think maybe also
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
the municipalities perhaps should be
 
04:01:56.450 --> 04:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
allowed to limit the Charities that
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
receive revenue from a
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming facility to Charities
 
04:02:00.239 --> 04:02:01.250 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming facility to Charities
that

04:02:01.250 --> 04:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
have offices in that particular
 
04:02:03.120 --> 04:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
have offices in that particular
community

04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly once again I'm not quite sure
 
04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
why you have a bill to approve a
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
commission to study all this when at the
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
same time you're making all these
 
04:02:15.769 --> 04:02:15.779 align:start position:0%
wholesale changes so I'd like to suggest
 
04:02:18.530 --> 04:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
you table the whole bill and wait until
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us today
 
04:02:25.199 --> 04:02:26.330 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us today
questions

04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
of course but I don't see any okay thank
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay now I think that is the last card
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have for Senate build 120 is there
 
04:02:39.610 --> 04:02:39.620 align:start position:0%
anyone else here to speak
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes a question of the Lottery
 
04:02:43.560 --> 04:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
oh yes a question of the Lottery
Commission

04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.250 --> 04:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Valerie King from New
 
04:02:57.530 --> 04:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery
 
04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
um same one that I asked Senator Lang
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
regarding the penalty provisions
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
if the current law provides specific
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
examples that illustrate the distinction
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
between a minor a moderate and a major
 
04:03:15.479 --> 04:03:17.330 align:start position:0%
between a minor a moderate and a major
violation

04:03:17.330 --> 04:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
and each of those carries a distinctly
 
04:03:19.439 --> 04:03:20.990 align:start position:0%
and each of those carries a distinctly
different

04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
penalty or fine level
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
what's the advantage or is there a
 
04:03:28.929 --> 04:03:28.939 align:start position:0%
specific reason why we should
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
remove that kind of language and leave
 
04:03:34.370 --> 04:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
it completely open-ended to rulemaking
 
04:03:38.650 --> 04:03:38.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think that I would uh Echo
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang in that it's it's
 
04:03:44.570 --> 04:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
if it were to be left in there would be
 
04:03:46.130 --> 04:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
no problems it's more of just a
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
redundancy issue it is further clarified
 
04:03:52.610 --> 04:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
in rules we set forth a lot more
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
parameters around when when it reaches a
 
04:03:58.910 --> 04:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
certain level and examples and in the
 
04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
rules as well
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so just to clarify the
 
04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
rules take these guidelines and expand
 
04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
upon them but you would see no problem
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
with keeping this language in the law
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you for coming up
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
could you fill out a pin card just so we
 
04:04:22.490 --> 04:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
have that too I guess thank you okay now
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing on
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 120 and we will now open up
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Senate Bill 119 relative
 
04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
to criminal background checks for
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
charitable games of chance licensed
 
04:04:33.239 --> 04:04:34.670 align:start position:0%
charitable games of chance licensed
applicants

04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
uh again for the record I am involved in
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
this industry and the chair will
 
04:04:39.479 --> 04:04:40.729 align:start position:0%
this industry and the chair will
recognize

04:04:40.729 --> 04:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Tim Lang welcome back thank you
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
members yes I am still a senator even
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
from this morning so we'll we'll
 
04:04:48.769 --> 04:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
continue on
 
04:04:50.450 --> 04:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a pretty straightforward
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
bill under under current law we have to
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
do background checks on charitable
 
04:04:55.140 --> 04:04:56.210 align:start position:0%
do background checks on charitable
gaming

04:04:56.210 --> 04:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
board members if you will
 
04:04:59.689 --> 04:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
um if you're a charity and you're
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
participating in charitable gaming we
 
04:05:03.250 --> 04:05:03.260 align:start position:0%
have background checks on board members
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
of the charity in and of itself even if
 
04:05:07.370 --> 04:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
the charity is not participating
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
directly and just a recipient of the
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
revenues so the goal is Bill and
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
speaking with Lottery again is I worked
 
04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
with Lottery on this this came out of
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
the Senate Ways and Means unanimously in
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
the Senate Finance unanimously and on
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
the floor unanimously
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the idea is we don't need to do
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
background checks on the charitable
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
board members the AG has the charitable
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
trust division that takes care of making
 
04:05:31.490 --> 04:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
sure that board members and boards are
 
04:05:34.250 --> 04:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
all okay the only exception is this law
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
was originally put in because as you
 
04:05:39.650 --> 04:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
heard before Charities used to do
 
04:05:42.170 --> 04:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
um you know the the basement bingo games
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
and poker games and those kind of things
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
so they're actively involved in
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
conducting charitable operations
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
nowadays that's a more of a professional
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
operation that's taken on by the gaming
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
operator so it doesn't reduce the gaming
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
operators from having to have their
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
background checks it doesn't reduce
 
04:05:59.210 --> 04:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
people so Charities that are doing like
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
their own bingo game would still have to
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
do a background check for the people
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
involved but it does take away that just
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
because the boys club and the Girls Club
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
of Nashua is working with a Nashua
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operation all the
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
board members don't have to have a
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
criminal background check just because
 
04:06:18.290 --> 04:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much would you be open to
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely excellent
 
04:06:28.750 --> 04:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and you just brought it up on
 
04:06:36.849 --> 04:06:36.859 align:start position:0%
does it cost more for the operator of a
 
04:06:40.490 --> 04:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
bingo game that is a single bingo game
 
04:06:43.250 --> 04:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
for one charity uh to go get the
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
background checks than it does to
 
04:06:48.530 --> 04:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
um go higher
 
04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
a consultant to do it for them
 
04:06:54.050 --> 04:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
bottle of a consultant can do a
 
04:06:55.969 --> 04:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
background check on somebody the state
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
police would do that background check
 
04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
and criminal check and so that is a
 
04:07:01.250 --> 04:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
standard last time I had my core reject
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%

04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's the cost to the Charities that

04:07:08.929 --> 04:07:08.939 align:start position:0%
own gaming operations they would have to
 
04:07:11.090 --> 04:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
pay for the people involved
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%

04:07:14.570 --> 04:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
time I had it done I don't know if it's
 
04:07:14.580 --> 04:07:17.450 align:start position:0%

04:07:40.849 --> 04:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
Valerie King New Hampshire lottery I
 
04:07:43.130 --> 04:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify the answer for
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative almi Bingo they are not
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
required to have a background check
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for a background
 
04:07:58.250 --> 04:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
check for Bingo or Lucky Seven it's only
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
games of chance
 
04:08:06.170 --> 04:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
but I think it's 48 dollars
 
04:08:11.330 --> 04:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
right if it has to be an FBI criminal
 
04:08:14.450 --> 04:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
background check so it is 48.
