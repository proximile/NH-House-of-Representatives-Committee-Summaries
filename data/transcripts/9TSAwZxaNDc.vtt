morning
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
everyone you know a while back I
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
received a story about a visiting Pastor
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
who attended a a men's breakfast in the
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
middle of a rural farming area of the
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
country the group had asked the an old
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
farmer decked out in his bibbed
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
overhauls to say grace for the morning
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
breakfast Lord I hate
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
buttermilk the farmer
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
began the visiting Pastor opened one eye
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
to glance at the farmer and wondered
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
where this was
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
going the farmer loudly proclaimed Lord
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
I hate
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
lard now the pastor was growing
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
concerned without Miss seen a beat the
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
farmer continued and Lord you know I
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't much care for raw white
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
flower the pastor once again opened an
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
eye to glance around the room and saw
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
that he wasn't the only one feeling
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable then the farmer
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
added but Lord when you mix them all
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
together and bake them I do love warm
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
biscuits so Lord when things come up
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't like when life gets hard
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
when we don't understand what you're
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%

Germany and back then at that point I
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
more I was actually wishing to eliminate
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
the cause of problem
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
that um created difficulties uh over the
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
Europe which means I wanted to
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
disintegrate former Soviet Union even
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%

allow me to go any
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%

however looking at the current situation
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
U right now as a revolutionary I think
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
that right now is the propitious moment
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
for us to finish that task which I
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
successful the United States really has
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
to succumb to the role of the leader in

00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%

and as I said before in my judgment this
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
is the opportune moment for us to win
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished but all this was carried
 
00:28:57.159 --> 00:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
accomplished but all this was carried
out

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
in order to have a new safe and secure
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
world however this world cannot be such
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
as yet because we have two still two
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
remnants lingering on from the old era
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
China however the technology and the
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
technological advancement that we as
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
mankind have accomplished uh demands
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
from us larger structures in which we
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
speak maybe you don't observe it as
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
clearly from your perspective of New
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the United States but if
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
you look at Europe and um you have have
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
to realize that there were so many
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
it when our forefathers invented a bike
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
when they could could move faster around
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
they created out of the
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.110 align:start position:0%
 
milons

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
milons
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
whereas now our technological
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
advancement really forces us to realize
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
that a single state a single country is
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
structures but in order to integrate us
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
into those bigger structures throughout
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
leader

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
back um during the times of our struggle
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
things seems clearcut there was an evil
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
Empire when the evil empire is no longer
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
there the United States is faced with a
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
tasks and I believe uh in my view this
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
new era still requires us to find
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
answers to three most important
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions and I believe it's under the
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
it what should serve as the foundations
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
for us integrated in the integrating in
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
era and right now the whole world is
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
it so when I raise the issue of the
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
foundations uh I hear in response two
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh half of the world claimed that it's
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
enough to base ourselves on freedoms and
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
Liberties a free market economy and
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislation they say that it would be a
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
Future whereas the remaining half claim
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
that this will not lead us
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.430 align:start position:0%
that this will not lead us
anywhere

00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
they claim that instead we should reach
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
a consensus on the values that we can
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
things and I refer to those shared
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
Commandments and only then can we
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
introduce a free market economy and
 
00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
introduce a free market economy and
appropriate

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and for the moment we cannot
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
really overcome this debate and uh
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
go however if we do find the answer to
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
appear uh what should be the economic
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
system applicable and actually
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the new era and the New
 
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
Order in the world commun certainly
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
question and I'm not claiming now that
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
it was either bad or good as a eonic
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
system but simply it has proven totally
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
world mankind has no time for further
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
out but certainly if someone would like
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
to say that maybe capitalism is the
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
response I think the capitalism which we
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
either it proved effective when we were
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
confined to our respective countries
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
effective and I've heard a reference to
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
that time of as a rats race one country
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
other and that capitalist system allowed
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
for people who could not keep the pace
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
jobless so bearing this in mind I think
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
that if we want to have um the answer to
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
my second question out of the capitalist
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
system we need to retain the premarket
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
economy whereas all its other elements
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
redefined we need to find the jobless
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
people all of them give them give them
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
now and the third third question that um
 
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:05.150 align:start position:0%
now and the third third question that um
arises

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
is how to handle populism and
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
demagoguery and politicians who cheat in
 
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:19.950 align:start position:0%
demagoguery and politicians who cheat in
their

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
majority bearing in mind another fact
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
that until the end of the 20th century
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
forly or more formally or less formally
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
all societies believed in a
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
God and many societies have rejected God
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
now until the end of the 20th century we
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
were scared of Communism and of the
 
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
were scared of Communism and of the
Soviet

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
Soviet
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
Union this is no longer in place these
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
place

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
hence the op question what can serve as
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
a self-control for Society members when
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
else but to to Briefly summarize it the
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
interest in terms of respective
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
valid we need to readjust our
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
structures uh readjust our thinking to
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
the perspective of this new era of
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
globalization as a generation we are
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
eras one has collapsed and the other one
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
has not uh taken its final shape yet
 
00:37:56.319 --> 00:38:04.190 align:start position:0%
has not uh taken its final shape yet
just

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
and if we look at all the world's
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
organizations all the uh systems all the
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
political uh parties for example they
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
are totally unfit to serve the new era
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can see it even better on the
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
Europe where you can very clearly see
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
that left-wing parties are much more
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
versa and uh it is ridiculous to look at
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
a at Christian
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
parties you will hardly find a single
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
believer being a member of a Christian
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
so to say
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
party so we cannot allow for such a
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
situation to
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
situation to
continue

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe there is only one aspect
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
in our life worldwide that has been
 
00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:07.190 align:start position:0%
in our life worldwide that has been
proving

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
regulations whereas everything else
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the world resembles a
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
situation where we want to drive but
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
regulations so here I am begging you on
 
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.950 align:start position:0%
regulations so here I am begging you on
my

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
needs we need to restore the leadership
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
world the Providence has given you such
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
a strong potential and you can really be
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
world but by any by any chance you are
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
very very unwar willing to continue
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
being their leader share your potential
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
with Poland and we will try to put it to
 
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:11.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:28.109 align:start position:0%
 
use

00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
so if we are successful in this second
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
part of our task uh they will say of us
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the future that not only
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
did they demolish the old order in the
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
one the demolishing of the old order was
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
led by Poland obviously Poland was
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
greatly assisted by the United States
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
people and we played that role very
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
effectively simply because we had been
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
prayed through our history in struggles
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
fighting quite simply because of our
 
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.670 align:start position:0%
fighting quite simply because of our
geographical

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
location uh we were we are located
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
between two powerful peoples the
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
German who enjoy military socializing as
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
remember so they would visit and revisit
 
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:52.190 align:start position:0%
remember so they would visit and revisit
one

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
another years back when there were no
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
airplanes and they would resort to hor
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
driven carriages they would always need
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
Poland you were free to um construct
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
your wonderful country your wonderful
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
United States of America doing
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
businesses meanwhile we had to stay
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
alert all the time occasionally even
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
there was in a way an advantage to that
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
location because people living there and
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
experiencing this uh learned how to
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate future developments and um
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
situation maybe some senior citizens can
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
still remember that before the outbreak
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
of the second world war polls were
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
trying to warn the world that the war
 
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.790 align:start position:0%
trying to warn the world that the war
was

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
imminent and what did we hear in
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
response the world said who cares we're
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
dancing we were trying to warn the world
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the second world war
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
claiming that Stalin was going to cheat
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
on the world that he was going to
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
install the Communist Regime throughout
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
half of the
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
world and that's exactly and
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was true because we ended
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
Soviets meanwhile now I think we have
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to put the final end to
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
the old order in the
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
world uh I guess you you know some
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
them you may know that the Polish people
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
are very proud very um they love freedom
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
Democratic when two Polish people meet
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
they will establish at least three
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
political parties between the
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
two and with the Communist Regime we
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
were forced to comply with one political
 
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
were forced to comply with one political
party

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
only so this is my plea under your
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
leadership American leadership we can
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
world for the time being obviously we
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
need to focus on the day-to-day
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
Ukraine people in Ukraine are murdered
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
homes Poland has embraced over three
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
million uh Ukrainian refugees mostly
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
women with
 
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
women with
children

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.850 align:start position:0%
 
obviously

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:37.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
that is obviously what we have to
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
continue doing and it's an obvious thing
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
for us to do and for the world to be
 
00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:49.870 align:start position:0%
for us to do and for the world to be
helping

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
us but then the the second track of our
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
activities should be all the efforts to
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
give the final blow to the current state
 
00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:03.980 align:start position:0%
of Russia of the Russian
 
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.309 align:start position:0%
of Russia of the Russian
[Music]

00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
regime because even if we defeat Russia
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
militarily today uh in 5 to 10 years
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
rise uh quite naturally because Russia
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
in its today's format is far too large
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
too large a country and on top of it
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
terrible so that's second uh strategy uh
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
is that under the leadership of the
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
United States and the guidance of the
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
United Nations we need to force a new
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
political system at to be introduced
 
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.309 align:start position:0%
political system at to be introduced
into

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Russia we must not allow for a single
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
individual a Madman uh threatening the
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
world and it's the system that they have
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
that and in case this strategy fails I
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
have an alternative
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.990 align:start position:0%
have an alternative
one

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
Russia is currently composed of about 60
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
ukrainians uh former republics that over
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the centuries have been absorbed into
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
Russia Soviet Union on the way and have
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
so I believe this alternative strategy
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
May consist in Awakening those people
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
motivating them to oppose Russia and to
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
want and to make them want Break Free
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
away from
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
Russia and what I think uh we want to do
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
people on the contrary Russia and the
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
Russian people will be grateful to us
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
because they too have been giving lives
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily for the centuries because
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
of their bad
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
regimes instead Russia can be such a
 
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.670 align:start position:0%
regimes instead Russia can be such a
beautiful

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
country but not bigger than having 50
 
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
country but not bigger than having 50
million

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
inhabitants so I think we are now
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
standing the chance of giving this final
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
blow and let us get down to work in
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
order order to uh pull the right
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%

previously passed the the house with
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
bipar and support and just some
 
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on how this policy would
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
be administered this is not a
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
nullification law it it does not
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
override or supersede Federal La in any
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
manner what this will do we'll simply
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
create a policy with the state of New
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not enforce Federal
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
firearm laws and and rules and
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that are inconsistent with
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
law the
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
concept of not the state not enforcing
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
federal laws is not new we've had this
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
debate on other subjects we discussed it
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing immigration even
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis we've had this conversation
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
before it's a matter of what the
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
policy uh we're going to put forward is
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
this does not prevent law enforcement
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
from enforcing other state laws are
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
working with Federal uh federal law
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement agents when it comes to
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing other state laws unrelated to
 
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.189 align:start position:0%
enforcing other state laws unrelated to
Firearms

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
Firearms
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
altogether the people of New Hampshire
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
have supported the Second Amendment
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
consistent since the founding of
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
consistently since the founding of the
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
state and that was even more evident
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
when the state and the people supported
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
adopting uh Article 28 to the New
 
01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:29.390 align:start position:0%
adopting uh Article 28 to the New
Hampshire

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
Constitution we've heard candidates
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
running for higher office candidates for
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
the president of United States saying if
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
they were elected fortunately that
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
candidate was not elected saying that
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
they would come and take your firearms
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:48.220 align:start position:0%
surrender it was on TV I heard it it
 
01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.630 align:start position:0%
surrender it was on TV I heard it it
[Applause]

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
happened the house will come to
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:58.830 align:start position:0%
happened the house will come to
order

01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
as I was saying that that candidate
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
still did not win uh any primary state
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
so but my my point is is
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
that if the federal government wishes to
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
create laws and rules and regulations
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
that are inconsistent with what the
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
populace of the state has has
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
traditionally supported the B the burden
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
should fall on the federal government to
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
enforce those laws not the state so I
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
ask that we concur because the only
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
change that was made was simply to
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
provided that the state would still be
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
permitted to report domestic violence
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
restraining orders into the Knicks that
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
is the currently under New Hampshire law
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
that is the law and the practice it was
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
simply for
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes only to make sure
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
that that information was properly or
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
would continue to be reported to the
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
Knicks it's not new
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
information it is the same information
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's been provided already that's also
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
a public record might I add that once
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
there is a restraining order domestic
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
violence restraining order anyone could
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
have access to it so I ask the body to
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
please concur thank you does a member
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
yield for a
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
question no the member does not
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
yield representative Bert requests a
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
roll call vote is that sufficiently
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
seconded okay then this will be a roll
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:12:16.030 align:start position:0%
 
seats

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur this
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a roll call vote representative
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
Harriet gothra is recognized for for a
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry and the house will
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
come to
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
order thank you Mr
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the other body
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
essentially handcuffs the state and
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement officials when it
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
comes to enforcing administering or
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
cooperating with federal gun laws and
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
regulations in New
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if I
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
know that it very well jeopardizes any
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
federal funding tied to the enforcement
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
of these laws and
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
regulations furthermore if I know that
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the changes
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
coming over from the other body failed
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
to fix flaws in the bill that created
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
gapping holes when it comes to Public
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
Safety also we also be giving more
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
freedom to gun traffickers felons and
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
our state to endanger both the public
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
and Law Enforcement
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
Officers I ask you is that what you want
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
I also ask you in the strongest possible
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
terms to vote red to non-c concur on
 
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
terms to vote red to non-c concur on
this

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill representative Bert is recognized
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
any federal
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
statute regulation or presidential
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
executive order that restricts and
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
regulates the right of the people to
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%

stop our local County or

state law enforcement from assisting in
 
01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:29.950 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement from assisting in
any

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
matters other than regulating
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%

this was a very long Bill about 18 pages

with changes to many statutes in an
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%

who have been here previously might know
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
as Senate Bill 3 the problem was when

the House reviewed the changes it it

revealed that the bill actually did a
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
lot more than what it was represented to
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
be the house spent a fair amount of time
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
going through those change es um and try

language that the court had ruled was
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the Senate essentially
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
redid our changes to this bill with an
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
another 18-page bill that came back um

after a review of the language it was
 
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
determined that it was the changes were
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
simply uh in two gross in amount for us

motion thank you Mr
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker I Rise to oppose the motion to
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
concur we should not legislate the
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
medicine especially when it contradicts
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
the best available able medical evidence
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
permitting a pharmacist to dispense a
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
medication by a standing order requires
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
a well- evaluated protocol established
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
through a broad consensus of providers
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists using the best available
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
data but a broad consensus in the use of
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
icin in covid does not exist you've
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
heard the claims that over 100 Studies
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
have shown Ivor mekton to be useful and
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
helpful in reducing the severity and
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
duration of
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
19 but this is not true there have been
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
numerous studies regarding Ivory mecin
 
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
and covid-19 which
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
sound you suspend for a sec yes sir yeah
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
I'm right here and I'm having trouble
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
hearing him can we quiet it down take
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
conversations outside
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
continue yeah um which sound compelling
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
but on analysis have design flaws they
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
to small sample sizes there's no
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
blinding no
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
randomization uh and various concominant
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
medications that confound the assessment
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
even the well-designed studies have
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
significant limitations so the bottom
 
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
line is the there are no definite
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
conclusions regarding the efficacy of
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
use of ican in treating covid-19 so we
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
should confine it to just studies that
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
are being done the bottom line is that
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
highquality medication efficacy Studies
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
have to be randomized double blinded and
 
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
have to be randomized double blinded and
Placebo

01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
Placebo
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
controlled only a few studies meet that
 
01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
high criteria and those do not support
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
the use of icin for the treatment or
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
prevention of covid-19 outside of
 
01:57:33.159 --> 01:57:35.149 align:start position:0%
prevention of covid-19 outside of
well-designed

01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
well-designed
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
studies so when I testified in the other
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
body against this bill I was asked the
 
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
question about well what's the harm in
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
just going ahead and passing this bill
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
and doing it and the issue is pretty
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
straightforward if you allow a standing
 
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
order for I and it implies that it is
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
effective that will divert people from
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
other truly proven treatments which can
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh treat the disease or even uh
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
well-proven vaccination which can
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
decrease the risk of serious disease so
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
what the Senate did to this bill is they
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
amended it to have its sunset in July 1
 
01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:12.629 align:start position:0%
amended it to have its sunset in July 1
of

01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
2024 the standing order authorization
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
with Sunset and created a commission to
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
study the efficacy of I in treating
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
covid in order to make a
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to whether the
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
authorization should be made
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
permanent now that's totally
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
backwards it is inappropriate to
 
01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:34.910 align:start position:0%
backwards it is inappropriate to
legislatively

01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
pretend that there is a consensus and
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
then evaluate to see if one
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
exists if it's determined by high
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
quality studies that iveron has a place
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
in treating covid-19 you can bet that at
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
some point it will become come commonly
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
prescribed without this bill again we
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
should not legislate the practice of
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
medicine and we don't legislate
 
01:58:59.159 --> 01:59:01.470 align:start position:0%
medicine and we don't legislate
scientific

01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
evidence in summary standing orders with
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists should not be used to
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
dispense medications for indications
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
that are not clearly supported by the
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
best available medical evidence and Ivor
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
meon does not reach that level of
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
evidence the Senate's attempt to
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
evidence the Senate's attempt to
compromise

01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
on the lack of evidence is not good and
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
we should not concur so we can let this
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
bill die and let high quality research
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
guide the practice of medicine so please
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
press red to vote no on the motion to
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
sir representative Mark Pearson has
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak in support of the
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker the Senate added some more
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
amendments than the ones just mentioned
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
the standing order shall not be used for
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
one who is pregnant the standing order
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be used for one who is under
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
18 the person receiving Ivor mechon
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
through a standing order shall sign an
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent statement stating there
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
is no proven benefit to treating co9
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
with Ivor mechon the study commission
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
has already been mentioned the said
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
provision is 2024 July
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
1st and I don't know anybody who wants
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
to use either mechon for
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
covid who is doing it and they do it
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to get
 
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so it's not drawing people
 
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
away from something they're not going to
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
do anyway and isn't it better to do it
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
this way than get Ivor mectin from
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian supply
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
concur the question is on the motion to
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
concur representative Tony Lakers
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%

02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a

02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
point

02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%

02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
concur house will come to order
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ker's recognized for
 
02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:41.669 align:start position:0%
representative Ker's recognized for
parliamentary

02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker and if I
 
02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
know that in the interest of time I did
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
not review all of the other
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
modifications made by the Senate as they
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
do not neutralize the flawed premise and
 
02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that the best available
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
evidence simply does not support the use
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
of ivory mecin in co9 and if I know that
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
legislation must be informed by the best
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
available evidence not poor studies and
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
wishful thinking and if I know that it
 
02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
is backwards to approve a treatment and
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
then look at the evidence and if I know
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
lastly that we should not legislate the
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
medicine what I then press the red
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
button to vote no on the motion to
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
concur so another motion could be
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
brought forward thank
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Mark Pearson's
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know there's
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
far more dangerous stuff available over
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
now names the house supp upon requests
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
later and if I know that this use is not
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
versus is getting uh
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations but it is instead of
 
02:04:00.669 --> 02:04:00.679 align:start position:0%
getting Ivor mechon from farm supply
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
stores would I not vote
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%

motion uh thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
04:05:10.670 --> 04:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker if you remember when
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was in their state of
 
04:05:14.349 --> 04:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
emergency there was an executive order
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
that said that any employee of a company
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts that worked at home
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
would now be subject to income
 
04:05:24.670 --> 04:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts income
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
tax if you recall also the Governor did
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
not like that idea and he filed
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
suit against Massachusetts and that
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
didn't go very well in the Supreme Court
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
which is where these kind of disputes
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
are are
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
resolved in the meantime 1097 was filed
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
and by the time it got to ways and means
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
that the state of emergency was lifted
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
and the uh the uh the executive order
 
04:05:51.399 --> 04:05:52.269 align:start position:0%
and the uh the uh the executive order
was

04:05:52.269 --> 04:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
rescinded so in ways the means we
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
decided to do like we did with Wayfair
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
to do a deterrence bill for the future
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
so we work with the a lawyer from the
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
AG's office and a lawyer from the
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue where we came up
 
04:06:09.070 --> 04:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
with Lang that we hoped that in the
 
04:06:11.070 --> 04:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
future if this occurred Again by any
 
04:06:14.110 --> 04:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
other State against us that that we
 
04:06:16.110 --> 04:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
would have some protections and the very
 
04:06:17.670 --> 04:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
least it would be taken up by the
 
04:06:17.680 --> 04:06:19.070 align:start position:0%
least it would be taken up by the
Supreme

04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%

where they wanted to do a few little
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%

coming together on a lot of things but
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
one thing we've always come together on
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
is taking care of our veterans um two
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
years ago when we were in a Democrat
 
04:22:52.510 --> 04:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
majority I introduced a bill to assist
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
veterans uh disabled veterans with uh
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
their children for school and that past
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
this year in the Republican majority we
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
improved that bill and it passed we work
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
together when we take care of our
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
veterans homelessness in general is an
 
04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
embarrassment to our
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
society homelessness to Veterans even
 
04:23:15.630 --> 04:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
more so and I'll explain
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
why um when earlier when we have the
 
04:23:21.870 --> 04:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
privileg of hearing U Le PESA speak it
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
brought back a lot of memories for me I
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
was stationed in West Germany when he
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
was actually going through his troubles
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
at the time and as I recall um the
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
Soviet military at the time scrambled to
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
to try and crush the Rebellion that was
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
going on in Poland
 
04:23:40.429 --> 04:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
and we in response to that also had the
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
scramble and we had numerous alerts and
 
04:23:44.429 --> 04:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
3 in the morning we'd be called to the
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
border and get down there with our tanks
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
just in case they crossed and it was it
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
brought back a lot of good memories too
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the Hamshire we have almost a 100,000
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
veterans that's a lot for the size of
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
our state we are eighth in the United
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
States for the number of veterans per
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
capita we are a patriotic and serving
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
state and we have a owe a debt of
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
gratitude to those folks and I'll
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
explain why every veteran when they sign
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
up for the military they write a check
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's payable to each and every one of
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
you and that check is a blank and it's
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
payable with their
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
life now many of them most of them
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
thankfully don't ever have to have that
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
check cashed at the end of this month
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be celebrating Memorial Day and
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's for the folks whose checks we
 
04:24:35.600 --> 04:24:36.950 align:start position:0%
that's for the folks whose checks we
cashed

04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
cashed
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
but the rest of us I don't know about
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
you you ever pay a bill and you write a
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
check and somebody just doesn't goad and
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
cash it it drives you nuts because you
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to keep carrying that over in your
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
in your Ledger every month well the
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
veterans that we have out there now
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
those checks are still out there and we
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
have no way of paying it back I don't
 
04:24:55.870 --> 04:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
know what someone's life's worth and I
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to try and put a value on
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
it but for the homeless
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
veterans there's a lot more we could
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
do there are numerous programs to help
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
them but the problem is a lot of them
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
come back from service and they're
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
damaged they have mental illness
 
04:25:13.640 --> 04:25:14.510 align:start position:0%
damaged they have mental illness
physical

04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
physical
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
illnesses and it's hard to get in touch
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and figure out ways to be helped when no
 
04:25:21.870 --> 04:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
one knows how to reach you when you
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how to reach anybody
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
else military teaches us to operate as a
 
04:25:29.229 --> 04:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
team when you get out of the military
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
you lose that team you're on your own
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult for some
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
especially in combat arms whose training
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
training was solely on how to kill the
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
enemy to fit back into society and find
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
a useful way to contribute and be a
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
member and a lot of times they end up on
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
the outskirts of our society and it's
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
our job to reach in and find them not
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
for them to find
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
us so right now we know of at least 120
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
homeless veterans in this state that's
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
120 people that are sleeping outside now
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people forget about the
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
homeless when the weather gets nice like
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
this but it has a lot more to do than
 
04:26:09.870 --> 04:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
just the weather imagine not having a
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
place to sleep not having a phone not
 
04:26:14.189 --> 04:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
having someone to help you with your
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments your medication
 
04:26:19.109 --> 04:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
your food there's a lot of things that
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
go along with that
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
roof so on this Memorial Day and in this
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
month which is um military um
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
recognition of veterans this month keep
 
04:26:33.550 --> 04:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
it in mind every time you pass a
 
04:26:33.560 --> 04:26:34.990 align:start position:0%
it in mind every time you pass a
homeless

04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
person first of all we need to help all
 
04:26:41.109 --> 04:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
the homeless but they could be a veteran
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we still like they still have that
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
check outstanding that we need to
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
fulfill and uh in closing I would just
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
also like to ask everyone why you're
 
04:26:51.870 --> 04:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
keeping the veterans in mind and keeping
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
the homeless of mind and we work
 
04:26:56.189 --> 04:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
together I commit next session that if
 
04:26:58.269 --> 04:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
God willing I'm here I'm happy to
 
04:27:00.510 --> 04:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor with anyone from any party
 
04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
any legislation to help the
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
veterans but also in the meantime if you
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
can afford it um think about donating
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
some formula to your local shelter
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
because there's babies that are running
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
out of food right now and with that I
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%

to that old man no matter how much he
 
04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
suffered the one thing he would never
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
part with was his waterl Victory Medal
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
it meant more to him than life itself
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
and he said to the magistrate your
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
worship I have about one thing to
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
say he said I was with Wellington at
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
watero and with that the magistrate teed
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
up banged his gavel and said this trag
 
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
against this man are
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
dismissed and I think about that story
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
and realize in the past almost 200 years
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
conditions for our veterans our homeless
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
and those being challenged haven't
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
changed all that
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
much and so this month we celebrate the
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
celebration of our members of the Armed

illness
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
and some of that mental illness would
 
04:30:40.269 --> 04:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
not have happened to him if not for the
 
04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
