thank the chairman of the entire

committee for letting me introduce HB
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%

Dolan representative Tony leus but they

have other bills to introduce at the
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
same exact time but my name is
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative Brody Dees and I
 
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
represent Carol 6 which is the town of
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
wolfboro the bill before you this
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
morning allows an employer to share
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
certain information with a law
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency about a candidate for
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
a position as a peace officer or other
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
position within a law enforcement agency
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
but simply this legislation would allow
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
for a thorough background investigation
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of a candidate who is to be employed by
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency only upon the
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
request of the law enforcement agency
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
who who is hiring said candidate some
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
former employers fear releasing
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
potentially negative information on
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
candidates for law enforcement positions
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
because of potential lawsuits this
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
causes former employers to limit the
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
information they provide law enforcement
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
agencies this can put us all at risk and
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
create potentially costly lawsuits for
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities the information this
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislation allows to be collected is
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
only to be shared between the prior
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
employer and potential new law
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies it can be further
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
shared with subsequent law enforcement
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
agencies too these are the only parties
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
who will ever receive this information
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
and as previously mentioned it prevents
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
any lawsuits from taking place when the
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
necessary information is collected it
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
also protects the privacies of
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
candidates for positions this addition
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
to the law and background investigations
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
make it clear that our law enforcement
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are able to collect the
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
information they need on candidates from
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
their former employers this allows for
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
the full vetting of any potential
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
candidates The Proposal before you
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
encourages more thorough background
 
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and the liability
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
protection for employers who provide
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
such information this is important for
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
some obvious reasons one reason is the
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies need this
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
information in order to make informed
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
decisions during the hiring process
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
these decisions always have the Public's
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
interest in mind the second reason is
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation protects previous
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
employers from being sued for helping
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies with this
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
process law enforcement agencies
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
properly vet vet candidates and only
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
hire individuals with the correct
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
temperament to guard the public and
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
promote Justice in their community and
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
again it prevents cost to lawsuits
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
whether it be lawsuits caused by
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
necessary collection of information or
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits caused by law enforcement
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
officers who acted in bad faith this
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
bill also addresses one of the concerns
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
raised by the governor's Commission on
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement accountability community
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
and transparency specifically
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation number 14 according to
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
this commission the New Hampshire police
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council should
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
quote amend administrative rule
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
p3105 on background investigations this
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
is located in RSA 106l col 6 Roman I and
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
is the law that supports P
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
30105 rule p
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
p3015 in order for a complete background
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
investigation law enforcement agencies
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
need access to personal records
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
employers need protection from lawsuits
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
HP 530 would give access to the
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
information needed to screen applicants
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
as proposed under recommendation number
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
14 again thank you for letting me speak
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I would ask that you reserve your
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions for those who represent our
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies their
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
professionals who know vastly more than
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
myself and requested the drafting of
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions I want to thank
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
chori Chief Shor he's promoted you may
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh thank
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Des has
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
really done a good job explaining the
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
issues and and what we're facing at
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
times it doesn't happen often but it
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
happens often enough that it ought to be
 
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.750 align:start position:0%
happens often enough that it ought to be
a

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
concern this bill I asked for it I've
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
run into it a few times I've been in law
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement 32 years um sometimes I
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
wonder if we miss something if we don't
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
get a good
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
full assist
 
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.470 align:start position:0%
full assist
it's

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
not it's meant to cooperate and get
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
cooperation and get us the information I
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
first ran into this uh kind of a thing a
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
few years back with a I got a request
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
from another state and part of their
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
request for information on an applicant
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
that had come before Tuftonboro was this
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
kind of lettering that you know you need
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
to comply with this for this reason and
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know you're
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
covered it doesn't just say I can ask
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
though I have to have it in writing I
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
have to have a release I have to provide
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of a I have to go through
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
certain steps before I can request this
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
information it also provides another
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
part of this is a level of insurance of
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
uh assurance that the information given
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
won't be shared so that businesses that
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
reveal that can a feel assured they're
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
not going to get sued and that their
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
secrets that could expose them to uh
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
issues won't be shared Beyond what's
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
necess necessary for the background
 
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.350 align:start position:0%
necess necessary for the background
investigation

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
um I certainly think that uh it's
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
important and in light of uh the Lea
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations this will be uh critical
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
going forward I'll take any questions
 
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
going forward I'll take any questions
you

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
have I
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
would one more thing though um there is
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
a bill in the Senate that does cover
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
some of this and that's the only
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
question that comes up is whether it
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
should be under this section of law
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
which is I I asked for this section
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
because it's right next to the municipal
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
background law for Municipal Employees
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the second part of that is or should
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
it be with the
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
106l um the laws for uh police standards
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and training
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
Council that's what the Senate bill that
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
has essentially the same language uh uh
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
is putting it towards there so that's
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we might want
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
to look at also is where where should be
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the laws the language is pretty much
 
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
in the laws the language is pretty much
the

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
same representative tesman thank you
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a great Bill I just have a
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
question I know that we have a tendency
 
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.150 align:start position:0%
question I know that we have a tendency
to

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
to
hire

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
hire
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
some small municipalities
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
you people to be Chiefs of police from
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
out of state who have have some law
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement background would this cover
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
or be applicable to their former
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
departments um I believe it would be at
 
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
least that maybe we wouldn't have the
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement ability of saying hey look
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
you got to do this but at least we have
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
assurance that what they do share will
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
be private and that might and they can't
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
be sued uh under our law anyways I can't
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
speak I don't know that we can set it
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
that they can be sued in other states um
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and I defer to somebody with a probably
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
a better legal mind than I but uh I
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
think it provides at least some
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
assurance that they can't be sued under
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and that what they
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
share with us will not be shared uh
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
Beyond what's necessary for the
 
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.430 align:start position:0%
Beyond what's necessary for the
background

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
investigation thank
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
Muse yes I I see in the existing RSA
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
this would actually uh this appears to
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
actually add a separate process for
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
background checks for police officers
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
and looking at the the background check
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
process described in the
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
419b employee candidate background
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
checks there are are quite a few things
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
in there that are um that are not
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
referenced uh in this particular piece
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
of leg legislation and I'm I'm curious
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
is this section intended to work with
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
the rest of the extended with the rest
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
of the RSA so it becomes part of a
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
broader background check process or does
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
this effectively repace the candidate
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
background check process that
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and towns use for other
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
positions that require background checks
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
to thank you um so by way of back we're
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
by way of we're fall under police
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
standards of training Council and their
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
rules like representative desay
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned their administrative rule
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
which is a very
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
detailed uh background process I think
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
what this would do is add to that what
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're you're referring to the municipal
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
one we have to do all that already
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
through uh RSA
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
106l uh and the administrative rules
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
enacted by police standards and training
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
Council we're required to
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
look into things that go beyond what
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
that law year citing talks about already
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh this just provides that level of
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
comfort beyond that that you can't sue
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
that that you need to cooperate you
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
can't be sued if you do and you this is
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to be private but we do well
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
beyond what's required under uh the
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
statute on Municipal
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%

downtime this is the this is perfect
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
time to exec something we're not opening

stay in recess at
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
9:30 till 9:30 but I think at 9:30 we
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:11.909 align:start position:0%
 
530

00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:37.549 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
at this time the the chair is now
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
opening the executive session on House
 
00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:44.750 align:start position:0%
opening the executive session on House
Bill

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
5:30 on this 8th day of February
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
a.m. would anyone like to be recognized
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
to make a
motion

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
rep represent this is a question of the
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
chair the ranking member has stepped out
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
of the room and is unaware of his
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding I wonder if we could just Hal
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
this for a moment or two just so that
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
she's uh can come back and we can begin
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
on a with every member aware of this
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
process I think that's a fair point of
 
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.549 align:start position:0%
process I think that's a fair point of
order

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
because she left the room when I said
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
that we will be in recess till 9:30 so I
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
feel that would be very disingenuous for
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
us to vote on anything while the ranking
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
member of the other caucus took me at my
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
word I appreciate youting I thank you
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
for pointing that
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
member representative
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
Gaff we have some downtime till 9:45 so
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
I decided that we would open the
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 530 the
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
bill we just had the hearing for
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cony raised the a very
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
good point of order that you left the
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
room based on what I said that we were
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
being recess and asked we wait for you
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%

or something like that he would be great
 
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.830 align:start position:0%
or something like that he would be great
to

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
testify I was told he was going to um
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
send in um a
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
testimony but I don't think I got
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:16.830 align:start position:0%
testimony but I don't think I got
it

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know I think people should have
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
concerned with that one
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
really I P J call me you know and she
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
never called
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
she sent a letter and I couldn't find
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
sh's number because I wanted to talk to
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
her personally I was feel uncomfortable
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
I have no idea rationality why you do
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
because not only that you I'm afraid for
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
all these people these and that are here
 
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.830 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
what and then it says somewhere along
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
the line some of them have to be trained
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
by with certain information but others

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and honored members of
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice and Public Safety
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
Committee for the record my name is Jan
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and I represent Ward one in
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
nasua and today I offer you HB 365 this
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
bill allows federal law enforcement
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
officers to be certified by the
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of safety
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of making arrests the
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
request for this bill came directly from
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
a constituent a neighbor in Ward one a
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
man who helps keep us all a little bit
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
safer and a member of the FBI I was
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
rather surprised when he explained his
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
request I didn't know it was in question
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
but he explained that a Vermont recently
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
put this into law and he was request
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
requesting this for New Hampshire um New
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Vermont does and there are
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
many other states that do as well he
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
Illustrated his request by saying that
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
if he by his presence was able to stop
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
an assault he couldn't arrest the
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
perpetrator they would be free to escape
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
and if this occurred in some areas of
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the state notifying the police would
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
mean that the person had more than
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
enough time to disappear OLS has
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
produced for us a limited and specific
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
addition to our law enforcement laws
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
mirroring the current law in Vermont and
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
other states that I believe May benefit
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the entire state so I ask you find HB
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
365 ought to pass thank you and I'll
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
questions I I I do have one
 
00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:51.589 align:start position:0%
questions I I I do have one
question

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
so how how would this work is this still
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
allow federal Offices to enforce state
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
laws in New
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is this is only in the
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
case of arrest and when someone is
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
arrested by uh an FBI agent in this case
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
they need to take that person directly
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
police uh if you see uh section number
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
three it uh specifically identifies the
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
use of this power
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's very limited and it's simply meant
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
to assist local police who may not have
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.789 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
Branch I'm
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
sorry our representative branch has a
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
question oh you to the thank you for the
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chairman my question is
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
are you concerned at all about possible
 
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.390 align:start position:0%
are you concerned at all about possible
Federal

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
overreach in this case it is only if the
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
person is
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
certified by um by New Hamshire and it
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
was only in a limited case and so I
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
would see that in the I don't know
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 other states that do this they
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
do not have a problem with overreach and
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
at a time when we're very very uh
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
careful about a police and giving extra
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
Powers this actually is is helping
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
police so that they do not have to uh
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
extend their own powers in a case such
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
as this it would be someone available at
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
the time and at that space who could
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
police representative
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
night uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
question are you concerned at all with
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh immigration Federal uh laws and our
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
communities that um that this might
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
endanger some of of these undocumented
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
communities uh in that case uh if you'll
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
check current law you'll find that
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's already a place I believe it is
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
in RSA 594 colon 27 uh excuse me 26 just
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
prior to where this would be added where
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is already taken care of and this
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
is this is specific only about to
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
prevent The Escape of an individual let
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
me see if I can read one whom the
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
officer reasonably believes has
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
committed a crime in the presence of the
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
officer so this wouldn't be like going
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
into someone's house knocking on their
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
door and taking them away this this has
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
to be immediate and it has to be right
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%

I my
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
question representative Smith do you
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%

bill

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh I asked my friend who is as I said a
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
constituent uh if anybody else was going
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
to be supporting it and I believe uh our
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
previous speaker is also on this bill uh
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
as he believed that it was an
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do for the state um
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
and I asked the gentleman who uh asked
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
me to bring this forward and he said
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
that his boss was uh watching this
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
well thank you you're welcome
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
my question you gave the example of a
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
federal law officer uh witnessing a
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
crime um even without this bill wouldn't
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
he be allowed to enable to uh make a
 
00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:15.069 align:start position:0%
he be allowed to enable to uh make a
citizen's

00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
citizen's
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
arrest uh I don't think that a citizen's
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
arrest would have the same value of this
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't I I think that the person
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
who was captured in this case would
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
probably bring suit against someone I
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
know I would I um I think that giving
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
them the power to do this and making
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
sure that it's followed through exactly
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
as we say it is allowed as I said to
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
take them directly to uh the state
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
police uh Barracks um that we've limited
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
what can be done and we've narrowed it
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
o' thank you Mr chair thank you take my
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%

00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
where is
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%

down I have a
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
question was training you have any idea
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
hours it says here uh section on line 17
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
complete study in answer law I know that

training you know how long training it
 
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.630 align:start position:0%
training you know how long training it
would

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
be I do not know I believe that would be
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner of of safety as
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
they have to be the one who uh actually
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
this representative the chair would like
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
is is can you give me any examples where
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
an FBI agent witnessed the crime or
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
really any of the the examples listed on
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
the A B C or D where they witnessed this
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
happened uh any of these but chose not
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
to act because this law wasn't in place
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's so much that they
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
chose not to act I'm sure what they did
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for what they were able
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
to do I'm sure they able to stop
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
whatever was going on and I'm sure that
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
they were able to uh identify the person
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
for the police later on this isn't a
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
matter of not being able to do anything
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
this is being able to do something
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%

today in uh support of this legislative
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
Bill uh specifically and uh some some
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
people have asked some excellent
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions here uh with with regard to
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
concern on uh
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
overreach and um uh possibly uh exposing
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh those those people who live in our
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
communities uh uh who may be um May have
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh status issues here in the country uh
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
that is not what this bill is designed
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
to address uh if I could
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh very quickly uh many of you
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
understand that a lot of law enforcement
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
activities here in the state that deal
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
with a high uh dangerous uh criminals
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
and criminal activity uh those
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
investigative uh efforts are are
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
conducted by task forces and these task
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
forces are made up of both uh local New
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police officers and they are
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
augmented by federal uh Law Enforcement
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
Officers as well uh during my 30-year
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
career I had the occasion to interact
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
with many members of these task forces
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh these task forces uh are really uh
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
looking hard at uh people bringing uh
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs and weapons into our uh
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
State uh the the task force members from
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
federal agencies uh bring the additional
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
support and resources that we would not
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise have available to us if we
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
were acting
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
unilaterally uh often times uh when
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
these task forces take uh action they
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
serve a warrant to arrest somebody who
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
is uh dangerous that's highly armed and
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh moving a lot of drugs into our
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
state uh these are very Dynamic
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
situations and uh in cases like that
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that the federal
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
officers have uh limited State
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
Authority uh so that they can act uh
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
unilaterally if they're on one side of a
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
house uh and and they're the only
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
officers in the back of that house and
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
then the suspect tries to exit the back
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
of the house this provides them with
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
very very sound uh legal authority to
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
take that action that is outlined uh in
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
this proposed Bill uh further uh this
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
situation already exists for spe uh
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
Federal officers uh here in New
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we already we already do this
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
but it it's only for uh Homeland
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
Security uh officers those officers that
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
are working on the border uh in Canada
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh and so this uh this special Authority
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
is already granted and it is already
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
overseen by our agency uh we uh here at
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
police standards and training there's a
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
a process in place uh for registering
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
and receiving appropriate training so
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
that they do have uh the state level
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
training that allows them to uh to act
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
in this fashion and carry this
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and uh I I don't see this as
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
anything more more than uh really just
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
extending what we already have to other
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement officers in a
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
way that will provide them uh the
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
authority to do their job and to help
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement keep our
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
our state safe and uh I would I would
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
ask uh that this committee support this
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
bill going forward and I stand ready for
 
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
bill going forward and I stand ready for
any

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hopper uh thank
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you for taking
 
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.069 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you for taking
my

01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
question um the sponsor seem to imply
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
but I assume it's not necessarily
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
strictly that
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
the uh federal Offices this would apply
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
to would be people that are reside in
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire but the way
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
you just described it I foresee
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
possible uh Federal officers who reside
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and coming into new is this
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
was this intended for people who just
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
live here and might happen to see a
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
crime in action and want to do something
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
or is this broader than
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
that uh I I believe that uh this is
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
probably uh broader uh understand that
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
we do have police officers that work in
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that do not reside in New
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh their residency is uh could
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
be in Maine it could be in Massachusetts
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
or Vermont that that is not
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
uncommon uh I I really think uh in
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
speaking with um uh my my counterparts
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and speaking with
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh specifically the special agent in
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
charge of uh the New Hampshire FBI
 
01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
office uh that that really the intent of
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation would be to uh to
 
01:02:48.279 --> 01:02:49.789 align:start position:0%
this legislation would be to uh to
provide

01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh strong legal footing uh and and State
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
Authority in those very uh Dynamic and
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations that need immediate
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
action uh who are assigned to those task
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
forces and are are helping New Hampshire
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh keep our state safe
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh and not to say that um uh you know
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
any help is good help uh when one law
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer wants to help
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
another law enforcement officer and it's
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for a federal police
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
officer uh to to you know inadvertently
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
find him or herself in in a very Dynamic
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation where they they don't have
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
time to wait for help and uh their
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
ability to step in and and uh protect
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
somebody uh and
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
and stop something before it escalates
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
into a real problem you know would
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
certainly be a benefit to New Hampshire
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
as well I hope that answers your
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
GFF so
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
um if an agent okay let's say from
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
Florida or wherever is vacationing here
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they feel they feel someone may be
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
committing a crime um that particular
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
agent can enforce the law and that's
 
01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
what this Bill is saying
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
correct uh no sir uh and I can
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand how how
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh you might come to that conclusion but
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
in fact uh the agents that we're
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
speaking of uh and the way I understand
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh how this bill has been constructed uh
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
is really very well controlled by the
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire th those
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who are federal law
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers would have to do
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
two things uh the first thing is that
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
they would have to complete a block of
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
instruction through New Hampshire police
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
standards and training that would bring
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
them up to speed on state law that is
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
specific that is specific uh to that
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
limited Authority that they would be
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
receiving in the first instance and then
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
secondarily they would have to then be
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
sworn in by the commissioner of safety
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh in order to uh to meet all the
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
requirements uh set forth in this bill
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not as if uh any federal law
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that happened to be
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
vacationing uh coming through our state
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh could uh unilaterally and without uh
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognition through police standards and
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
training and without recognition through
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh the department of safety uh they
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority that were
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
to I a
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
follow representa Gaff you recognize for
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
a followup question okay so if this bill
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
was generated based on one agent um out
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
of Nash from what I understand is that
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
correct it wasn't something that um the
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
police um training or anything came up
 
01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:53.069 align:start position:0%
police um training or anything came up
with

01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:55.390 align:start position:0%
with
correct

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh so uh candidly uh just prior to uh uh
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
the events in Washington DC I had the
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
occasion to speak with uh special agent
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
in charge uh jibli uh who is the special
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
agent for the FBI here in New Hampshire
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
so he oversees the FBI operation here in
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh he and I had a very
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh clear conversation relative uh to
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
this effort uh I don't know who authored
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and I don't know who the FBI
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
agent is who spoke with the author of
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
that bill but I do I can speak uh to the
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
fact that special agent jibli and I
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
spoke about this and his concern about
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh being able to provide this type of
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
law uh law enforcement Authority at a
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
state level for his Task Force officers
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to New Hampshire task
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.829 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to New Hampshire task
forces

01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.839 --> 01:07:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hearn thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my question I guess you
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
kind of answered the question about uh
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bosses um but I still uh going back
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
to the Border you said that the we
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
currently have it up there and how long
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
ago was
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I I'm I'm sorry sir I I don't uh
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
question okay because the followup
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
question to that was is why didn't we do
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
it then uh and why are we doing it
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
now and and again
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
um for the record I've only been here
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
for about 10 months I and I so I can't
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
speak uh to that that question I don't
 
01:07:44.839 --> 01:07:47.710 align:start position:0%
speak uh to that that question I don't
know

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
followup representative Hearn you
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
followup do you know of any
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh thing on the federal level that may
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
be coming down the pike uh in regards to
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh broadening the authority of the
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
federal officers due to the recent
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh last month's situation and that we
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
may be doing something that um we may
 
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
not even have to
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
do uh I I know of no uh kind of ideas or
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts or anything that would be
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
coming from a federal level and can ly
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe that they that the
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
federal government would have authority
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
to um to extend uh state level authority
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
to any of their officers that would that
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
would need to come from
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
us one more
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
followup representative for another
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
followup and can you tell me how many
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
other states currently have these uh
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
laws that they've passed I cannot
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:57.229 align:start position:0%
laws that they've passed I cannot
sir

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.239 --> 01:08:58.749 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
Knight um thank you chairman and thank
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh sir uh how
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
many times during your career so far
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
have you experienced specifically in our
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
state that the lack of this law impeded
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
your ability to carry out
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
Justice I I can say uh from my very uh
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
personal experience uh on the the few
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
times that I assisted with a a warrant
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh that was enforcing state law uh and
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
that warrant was being served by a task
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
force that was made up of both uh New
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police officers state police
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
officers uh members of the
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
DEA uh while uh it there was never a
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
time uh where I can say it the lack of
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
authority caused a problem uh with those
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
Federal officers I can tell you
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
unequivocally that had had the service
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
of those warrants not gone exactly the
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
way that we had
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
planned uh in those they can be very
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
Dynamic situations and and we want to
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that these federal law
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers are are
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
are acting under the color of state law
 
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.189 align:start position:0%
are acting under the color of state law
uh

01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
so so to to specifically answer your
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
question I never personally saw an
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
impediment uh but I think it was
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the service of
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
those warrants went without any kind of
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh changes they went the way that they
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
were planned to go so I um I wish I had
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
that representative KN recognized for a
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
fall question thank you chair have you
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
considered uh to start to document um
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
this for us for the state as as we move
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
forward we would it would be great to
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
have that data so we could um get a
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of how to better
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
help our law
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement yeah uh uh representative
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
Klein I I uh one of the things that uh
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
we are uh definitely trying to get ahead
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
of and this is not only on this topic
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
but on a number of different criminal
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
justice topics across the board and that
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
is this this you know high high level
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh the collection of data
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh uh certainly very very important
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
probably we definitely can do a better
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
job of collecting data than we do right
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
now and there and again that's that's
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
widespread across New Hampshire law
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement and criminal justice so uh
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
you're definitely on point and that
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
would be something that um you know we
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
should we could very easily begin to
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
start collecting that data
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
agree represent you have a followup
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
chair representative Marston thank you
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking our
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
question it seems to me that the
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning on two sides
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
and the presenting the case they want to
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
talk about an isolated situation where
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
somebody visiting the state can jump in
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time we're talking
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
about a plan to have people going
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
through a training program so on and so
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
forth and then we find that you are
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
doing it already with warrants so I'm
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
confused why you need this bill
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
and and I've had a lot of people send me
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
emails speaking up against it on various
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
levels the question is do you see the
 
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
levels the question is do you see the
the

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
jbless in it's an incident isolated and
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
then it's a plan having a bunch of
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
up I'm sorry sir I'm not I'm not clear
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
on your question if you could rephrase
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
please representative Marson do you want
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
to re uh rephrase the question
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
confuted it's a confuted situation that
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're presenting to us on one hand it's
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
an isolated incident that happened and
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
one officer had wanted to be able to do
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
it on the other hand you want to have a
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
whole organized situation where you're
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
having federal Offices get certified
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.199 --> 01:14:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
state

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
why uh thank you
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
sir so I I it is my understanding uh and
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
based on the discussion that I've had
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
with uh the special agent in charge here
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the FBI uh that this bill is is
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to address uh providing
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
State authority to Federal officers who
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
are assist
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police officers in the
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement of uh New Hampshire laws
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
um where we we as a law enforcement
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
Community really rely on our federal
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
Partners to help uh you know enforce
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
these laws and take these these uh
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
criminals off the
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
streets uh I I did not take part in any
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a discussion
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
with the special agent in
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
charge uh relative to the one-offs that
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
you spoke of earlier just uh granting
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
people Authority you know so that if
 
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:06.750 align:start position:0%
people Authority you know so that if
they're

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
in you know a store a local business and
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
a crime happens in front of them that
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
they could act I think that that would
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe a you unintended
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
benefit but but clearly I think this
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is is being put forth to
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
help provide federal law enforcement
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
officers working in an organized kind of
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
environment with New Hampshire police
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
officers to give them that state
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
Authority so that when they're doing a
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
drug warrant or they're they're trying
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
to arrest uh an
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
individual uh who's bringing guns into
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
the state or something that you know a
 
01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
the state or something that you know a
child

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
pornography uh New Hampshire law
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement really has a difficult time
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
addressing these these uh types of
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
situations without Federal partnership
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so to that end uh I see that that's
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
why this bill is being introduced the
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
way it
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
is representative Marson recognize for a
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
followup question yes thank you Mr
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman simply put aren't you already
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
doing that you guys get together and you
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
carry out a warrant you use the federal
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
government and the local police as it is
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
right now this becomes a move point to
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I I uh I think um that there
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
could be a situation in the service of a
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
warrant or uh the the attempted arrest
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
of an individual
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh by members of a task force where uh
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
that Federal Officer that's part of the
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
task force may be separated from the
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the group and will have to act
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
unilaterally and it's important that
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
they have state
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
Authority uh to take those types of
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
actions including uh responding to any
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
kind of force that's used against them
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and that that is uh that is why I see
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
important representative Hopper uh thank
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh for taking my
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
question um it has been a longstanding
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
understand uh understanding of the
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we're really not
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a federal police force
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
and yet you actually said in your
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe you called them
 
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe you called them
federal

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
police um don't you see this is uh
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
encroaching on the constitution in any
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
way no I'm sorry if if I I I I may have
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
used the term federal police officer ERS
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
to kind of Encompass the FBI the DEA the
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
ATF uh and and so I I apologize for any
 
01:18:03.159 --> 01:18:04.910 align:start position:0%
ATF uh and and so I I apologize for any
miscommunication

01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
miscommunication
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I I
 
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh and I I
don't

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see that that that is a
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
concern um if that if I'm answering your
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
question if I understand your qu
 
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.189 align:start position:0%
question if I understand your qu
question

01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative board name thank you Mr
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
question um in the in the bill it has uh
 
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that the law enforcement
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
officer needs to completely satisfa Rec
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
complete a course study in New Hampshire
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
laws procedure I assume that this is
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh you speak
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh you speak
louder

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
louder
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm looking at the uh training
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
required and I'm wondering how long the
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
course of study this is and what it
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
complete I I'm sorry sir I only heard
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
bits and pieces of that but I I want to
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're asking uh what
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
what the components of the training are
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
and how long it takes for them to
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
complete it
 
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.070 align:start position:0%
complete it
that's

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
correct uh candidly I don't have the
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
number of hours in front of me right now
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
I do know that they do have to complete
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
a block of training uh that speaks
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
directly to those uh pieces of limited
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
Authority uh that they would be entitled
 
01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:43.189 align:start position:0%
Authority uh that they would be entitled
to

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
enforce um we have uh and again this
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
process is already in place for for
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
Border agents we already do this for for
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
just that that one
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
agency and
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
um there was a question asked about how
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
long we're doing this for I that I don't
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
know um but it is a it is a very uh uh
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
strict process they have to uh that
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
agency uh has to send us uh the names of
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
these officers uh we have to make sure
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
that they have gone through the training
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
once they complete the training they go
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of safety who swears
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
them in and and this is monitored
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
annually so um there may be times when
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh a a uh FBI agent is assigned to uh a
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
task force and then a year later that
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
FBI agent has been transferred they
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't carry that Authority that we've
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
granted them with them uh it is it is
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
very tightly controlled by New Hampshire
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
police standards and training and if
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
they do not uh meet the requirements and
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
rep reporting requirements
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
annually then uh that that Authority is
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
no longer granted to them so it is very
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
it's very strict it's very narrow uh the
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
training is very specific we keep
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
records of uh these officers that um go
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
through the training and then have the
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
authority granted by uh the commissioner

forgive me if this has been asked before
 
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
stepped in and out of the room a couple
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
times but we've heard a little bit about
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
the types of officers or the types of
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement who might be certified
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
under this proposal do you have a
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
ballpark sense for how many um people
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
would carry this um this extra Authority
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
answer I I am going to um uh answer that
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
question through uh antidotal knowledge
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh just in my time here in New Hampshire
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh and and the number of
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
task forces that uh I have been familiar
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
with during my career and I I don't see
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
that there would
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
be I can't imagine there would be more
 
01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.189 align:start position:0%
be I can't imagine there would be more
than

01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:23:54.199 --> 01:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
than
maybe

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
40 and maybe tops 50 I if we uh included
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
every every federal agent that is
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
working within the borders of the State
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire actively working in a
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
capacity where they they would need
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
these Powers whether it's um because of
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
border patrol uh and and their their
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
position on our state border with uh
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
Canada uh or whether it was deah FBI
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
agents ATF agents that were working in
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
um group task forces I know that I I
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
spent the majority of my time in the Sea
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
Coast so I know that there was a there
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
was a Portsmouth group um and then there
 
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
was a Portsmouth group um and then there
was

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was actually two Portsmouth
 
01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
groups um and I think uh you know
 
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
clearly there's uh there's going to be
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
some heighted groups which are the
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
height uh high-intensity drug
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
groups uh that work uh across the
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
borders of U our state and and those
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
those states that border us um yeah I
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
can't imagine more than 40 or 50 at a
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
time and that's that's including
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
you if I may ask a question do you thank
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is is there
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
any discussion or consideration on how
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to subing a federal agent
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
who was involved in making an arrest at
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
level I mean if there's going to be a
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
Cas or a civil case that's usually
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
something that could happen I'm just
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
wondering my understand a stateena
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
served out of state on a federal agent
 
01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
served out of state on a federal agent
can

01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
I apologize I I I'm not understanding
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
the question is your
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
question can a state can uh can a
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Officer be served a civil
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena well how would you how I'll
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
rephrase it how do how would a person go
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
about who's either whether they were
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
arrested for in charge of the crime by a
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal federal agent under New
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law if that if that defendant
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
subpoena the federal
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
agent and that if that federal agent
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
resides out of state how would they go
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
about doing
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
that for for an action that uh and I
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
think we're we're talking about If This
 
01:26:43.639 --> 01:26:45.550 align:start position:0%
think we're we're talking about If This
Were

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
Were
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill was in place the the
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
officer the Federal Officer Had State
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
Authority they took an action in the
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
State and
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
then uh the the defendant wanted to
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
bring them to court is
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
that if they're arrested prably they'll
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
be in court right it was a let's say a
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
federal civil rights case that could be
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
brought this I mean that would be a
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
federal case I'm just saying if there
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
was civil liability per se at the state
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
level how would a person whether in a
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
criminal case or civil case go about
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
subpoenaing or serving process on the
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
federal agent who resides out of state
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
court I would say that they would use
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
process that that any other uh person
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
state I don't I don't know that by
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
virtue of the fact that that individual
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
is an employee of a state agency that
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
had check that a federal agency that has
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
State Authority would be treated any any
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
any differently in a civil case I I I
 
01:27:55.639 --> 01:27:58.030 align:start position:0%
any differently in a civil case I I I
don't

01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
365 great uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for taking my
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Sophia Bondo
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
I'm for 14 I live in Manchester um I'm
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
just in my house um and I'm speaking
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
High School Democrats in opposition to
 
01:29:29.159 --> 01:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
High School Democrats in opposition to
HP

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
HP
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
365 I'm testifying in opposition to HB
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
365 because we do not need additional
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in our communities who
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
are disconnected from locals in daily
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
life rather than expanding on already
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
well-funded law enforcement we should
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
focus on reforming the system we have
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
now as we have seen in Portland during
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
black lives matter protests Federal
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
officers only incite further tensions
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and there's often little communication
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
with local officers
 
01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
Federal officers should not be given
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
peace officer status as it will give
 
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
Federal officers who may have no
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
connection to the town the same power as
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
a local officer who has a family in town
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between these two types
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
of officers is clear one has a life in
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with family and friends
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
that they truly care about while the
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
other may have no connection to the real
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and little
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of the specific dynamics
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the unique towns and cities I ask the
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee vote against this bill to
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
reform

Conley testify thank you Mr chairman
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee members I state representative
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
from Dober here to
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
ince3 this bill would require law
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies within New
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to equip officers with body
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
cameras and EST is a grant program to
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
help Department Aid these devices B also
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies procedures for body camera
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
footage captured in violation of
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
existing rules but which is potentially
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
exculpatory in a civil or criminal
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
matter there are a lot of arguments out
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
there uh in support of body cameras I
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
suspect the committee has heard many
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
before uh but to me the most compelling
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
argument in support is that body cameras
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
improve trust and police build support
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
for law
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement this is particularly
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
critical now in this current atmosphere
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
influenced by the event from last
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
summer excuse me in fall but it was also
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
true uh 200 years ago in England well
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
before social media could amplify these
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
events and well before smartphones
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
existed to capture encounters with
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
police way back then Sir Robert Fel
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
considered a father of modern policing
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
observed that and I quote the ability of
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
police to perform their duties is
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
dependent on public approval police
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
existence actions Behavior and the
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
ability of police to secure and maintain
 
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.709 align:start position:0%
ability of police to secure and maintain
public

01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
respect quote body cameras are an
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
important way to maintain and builds
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
that public respect and
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
approval they provide firsthand evidence
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
of what happened in a given incident
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
they can refute claims of excessive for
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
ORS of conduct data from the Department
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
of Justice they shown they can lead to
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
better compliance with police
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
commands this Viewpoint is increasingly
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
shared across the political Spectrum
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
Governor senu as we know issued an
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
executive order last year effectively
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
calling on the state police to take
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
steps to adopt
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
body poll after poll is shown nearly 90%
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
of Americans want their police wearing
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
these devices cost has long been a
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
hurdle for broader adoption of body
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
cameras particularly for small
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
departments and this bill establishes a
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund to offset those
 
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
costs as proposed 1% judicial fine
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
assessments would move from the general
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
fund to this new fund specifically for
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
funding body cameras and in round
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that comes to about 35,000 a
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
year available for
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.750 align:start position:0%
year available for
purpose

01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um we know body and dash Camas are
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
included in the Senate's Omnibus police
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
Reform Bill that's making it way through
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
that chamber
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
one key difference is that that bill
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
does not include a funding mechanis it
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
does not include funding although I
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
understand that could be approv
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
separately in the budget until we have
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
more clarity on those issues I ask the
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend passive of this
 
01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.629 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend passive of this
bill

01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
um and I will finally note that this
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh was developed by the former
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
um and although I had intended to defer
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
some questions to him I believe he's not
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
available to testify today with that I
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
testman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
um you talk about $35,000 a year in a
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
fund or something like this for a
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
grant real expense on body cams as I
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
understand it because we've heard this
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
issue before are on the long-term
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
cataloging of these uh the film and or
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
not film but the the memory cards and it
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
effectively probably take one person
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
extra at each police agency uh how do
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
you propose to to fund that or you just
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
pass that down to the to the cities and
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
towns thank you representative my
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
understanding in researching this bill
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
is that um you can purchase packages
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
that address the storage of this data
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
and as existing statute around body
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
cameras already makes clear that this uh
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
data is not kept in perpetuity it's um
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's there are strict rules for handling
 
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
this data so uh I hope that answers your
 
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.270 align:start position:0%
this data so uh I hope that answers your
question

01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
followup representative tman recognized
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
question that's exactly what I was
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
talking about was cataloging and uh
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
responding to requests for it and so on
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I'm trying to figure out
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
how you're going to pay for that in a
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
small community let's say Chichester
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
over here which had four or five uh
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
policemen right now they're not their
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
job is not to catalog this when they
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
come in off the
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
shift I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to do this
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so the again I
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
refer to the existing statute which
 
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
refer to the existing statute which
carefully

01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh clarifies when these devices would be
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
used so that they're not collecting um
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
you know eight hours worth of data on a
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
ship um I don't know the the inner
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
workings of small departments to know
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
what a what an officer's responsibility
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
entails um but I think the statute is
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
limited such that officers are not doing
 
01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
precisely what you describe or having to
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
you representative green thank you Mr
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
question uh with a police office will be
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
able to turn this off if he uh was
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
approached by someone that wanted to
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
give him some information but didn't
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
want to be involved under the
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
recording thank you representative that
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
scenario and many others like it are
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
already covered under the body camera
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
statute the key difference under this
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
proposal is that uh this uh departments
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
are currently uh not required to have
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
them uh to have them in general so the
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
current standards uh would remain in
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
proposal representative Maron thank you
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you than question in
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
the course of listening you're saying
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
that there's already a law we have a law
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
on the books about body cameras and
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to arent it with more
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
RS thank you representative so yes uh
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
body cameras are carefully regulated in
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
our state uh many basically any scenario
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
one can imagine um is is a rest in
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
statute this the difference is this is
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary now nobody's required to do it
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would make body cameras part
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
of uh a required part of a police
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
officer you know uniform and
 
01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:36.020 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:39.870 align:start position:0%
so thank
[Music]

01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Hopper uh thank you
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
take my question
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
um I love the idea of uh of having
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
having uh body cameras the curdle I'm
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get over is the 28a issue of
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to uh create
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures at the local level without
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
financing them and is this is this
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
actually is the expected revenue from
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
this bill really enough to cover the
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
cost for body cameras and wear and to as
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative tester pointed out to
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
maintain the
 
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.390 align:start position:0%
maintain the
um

01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
um volumes of
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
information representative thank you
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
um I've had that same thought uh I do
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
not believe the revenue stream uh is
 
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
will cover every officer in the state
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
nor I don't believe was it intended to
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh cover I think it was meant to
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
supplement uh the cost of these devices
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
which range from pending on packages and
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
so on 100 to 7 or 800 per unit so
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to outfit every
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
officer in the state but it could go a
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
long way to
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
outfitting many officers across many
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
departments over a couple
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
years I will also point out that the
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
statute there's no penalty uh for a
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
department that's not in compliance I
 
01:41:09.599 --> 01:41:10.510 align:start position:0%
department that's not in compliance I
think

01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it would be presumed that this might
 
01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.070 align:start position:0%
um it would be presumed that this might
not

01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
happen thank you representative
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
Welch yes this uh uh Bill provides a
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
public safety enhancement fund is that
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
only for the purchase of the
 
01:41:28.239 --> 01:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
only for the purchase of the
cameras

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
Happ thank you representative um as the
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
dra or as the bill is written funding
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
for these uh cameras shall be provided
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
by the state in the form of Grants the
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
grant is not specified so um we
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully got to a point where every
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
officer was equipped sufficiently and
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
the the funds uh continue to appr in
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
this account and could go toward that
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
purpose representative wels recognize
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
question as we we've heard in the past
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
when we've had similar bills that the
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
major cost for body warn cameras is in
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
the retention of the images catalog as
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
was brought up before this is a a
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate under 28a we
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't be
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
doing you
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
agree thank you sir for the question uh
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
bill follow question my reading of the
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
bill indicates there would be a
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
locality theill
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I believe that the roll out
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh of this bill would be would structur
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
it would not cost additional money to
 
01:43:03.679 --> 01:43:05.950 align:start position:0%
it would not cost additional money to
departments

01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
than representative board
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
name thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm also concerned
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
about the funding level for this being
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
coming in a mandate I'm wondering if you
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh would mine a amendment that changes
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh line 25 from Shia to
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
May that way departments that wanted to
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh carry out this uh
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
um the body uh cameras would be allowed
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
to as long as there resp money in the uh
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
funding um and if we did this on a uh uh
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
a trial basis we could find out whether
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
or not the funding sources actually were
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uh cover the
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
cost thank you representative um not
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
being involved in the drafting
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
um I hesitate to offer an answer but I
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
believe uhing more officers through this
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
you representative col the the chair has
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
a question I want to thank you in
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question on the
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
second page lines five and eight what is
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
the rationale only allowing the body cam
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
footage to be used in in a Court
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
proceeding if it's exculpatory but not
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
incriminating representative thank you
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to offer to the best of my
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge which is this is a a snapshot
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
of the quite long existing statute
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
around how this footage can be used and
 
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
the key provision that I want to point
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
out to try to answer your question is
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
that this addresses a specific subset of
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
footage that was in violation of the
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
statute but which is also culpatory so
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's the key point so
 
01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
U I would I would expect and having not
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
memorized the statute that it covers
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
what you were ask incriminating evidence
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
throughout and that this is the special
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh exception for exculpatory EVs and I
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised I want to
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
T the next person uh representative on
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
the list of testify now now
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative franch you are also here
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
participating on the committee you're
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
free to testify if you'd like or yes I
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
would like to Mr
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh as one of the sponsors I
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
cannot ask questions so I would rather
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
testify um thank you for for letting me
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
testify uh I'm here to say that if you
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
are in favor of police if you support
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
the police then you should support this
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill because body cameras help police
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
officers perform their duties by filming
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
criminals in the act and that is truly
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
the important part is that it adds an
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
independent verifiable source of what
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
happened and that is why I am in favor
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%

01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%

defense
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers um in terms of the uh background
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to share with the the
 
01:49:07.229 --> 01:49:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee would be that uh I personally
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
have handled thousands of cases uh
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
dealing directly with police and arrests
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
um during that time I'm constantly
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
amazed at and I understand that the
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
representatives concerns about cost but
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
I would actually submit that the cost of
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
a body warn camera actually reduces the
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
cost of an actual case on a Town um I I
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
practice as I said primarily in Grafton
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Coos and Carrol counties and in large
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
part those towns uh some of those towns
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
are among the poorest in the
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
state among the poorest in the state I
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
would suggest that and it's my
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
experience that those towns actually
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
have been voluntarily using body warn
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
cameras for example Lisbon Berlin and
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
hail all use bodyw warn cameras what is
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
amazing to me is that some of the more
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
affluent towns in the police do not in
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
fact the state police do not use body
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
warn cameras uh in any of the cases that
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
I have had um and and quite candidly I
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
believe that that's simply wrong it's
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
not only wrong but it's dangerous it's
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous for the people in the public
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous for Citizens that are
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
accused and it's dangerous for the
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
police one of the things that I'd like
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
to share with the committee are a couple
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
of examples of what we have seen and and
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
some of the turmoil that it's created um
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are fatal shootings
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and we have been
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
involved with some of those up in the
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state there are two
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
cases that I'd like to highlight for the
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee in particular there was a
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
fatal shoot shooting that was captured
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
by um body warn camera from the hail
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
Police Department it involved the SD
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
Lenin shooting in bath and in that
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
situation the haal police officers
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
confronted an individual um who had a
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
knife he took the knife and he charged
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
at the police the police were wearing
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
bodyw warn camera and it captured this
 
01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
lethal potentially deadly attack and the
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
police responded by ordering the person
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
to stop they responded accordingly and
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately fired and shot the man dead
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
but the bodyw warn camera captured all
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
of that the urgency The lethality the
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
encounter was memorialized and able to
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
be observed by people under a a calmer
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
much more cool collected perspective and
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
it helped heal what was
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
occurring in contrast what I would
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
suggest is the the horrible shooting up
 
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.629 align:start position:0%
suggest is the the horrible shooting up
in

01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:51.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
Franconia of Officer McKay was not
 
01:51:58.830 --> 01:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
captured by by bodyw warn camera and it
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if you folks are familiar
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
with the situation but if I may I would
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
just go through the facts very briefly
 
01:52:07.709 --> 01:52:07.719 align:start position:0%
there was a a young man Leo Kenny who
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
had been stopped by Officer McKay
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
previously they had had a runin um
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
officer McKay and he did not see well
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
eye to eye and um Mr Kenny was pulled
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
over by Officer McKay for a speeding
 
01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
over by Officer McKay for a speeding
ticket

01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
um we're there's no body warn camera so
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're taking people's uh we're taking
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
Snippets of people's recollection that
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
survived what we were have been able to
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
glean is that officer McKay ultimately
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
was told by Mr Kenny that I'm not
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
stopping for you I want another officer
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
and he sped off officer McKay forcibly
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
stopped Leo Kenny's car um forcing it to
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
stop stop um approached Mr Kenny pepper
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
sprayed him Mr Kenny then fired four
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
shots and and shot and killed Bruce
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
McCay um at that point uh Mr Kenny tried
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
to take off uh a passer by a George
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
Floyd provided a narrative that he saw a
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
gun and he picked up the police
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
officer's gun and he shot Leo kenned
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
when he refused to put his gun
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
down I tell this story so that you can
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
have both the example of having a body
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
born camera and the example of not
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
having one this town of Franconia is a
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
small village it's a very tight-knit
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
Village and prior to the shooting of Leo
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
Kenny and officer McKay I would say it
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
was a mostly harmonious Village since
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
that time and it's been quite a while
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
now um that town still has raw nerves
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
and wounds it's a town that's not well
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
it's not healed and it's been years and
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
years since those events have
 
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:54.679 align:start position:0%
transpired um so what I would urge this
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee to do is not to strike the
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
language of mandatory language requiring
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
body warn camera body warn cameras solve
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
situations that you could never imagine
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
arising they eliminate the conflicts
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
Because the actual footage of the event
 
01:54:10.679 --> 01:54:11.550 align:start position:0%
Because the actual footage of the event
is

01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
preserved it makes it easier for courts
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutors lawyers citizens to feel
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
that they actually can observe the real
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
disputes instead about of arguing about
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
what happened what we spend our time
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
litigating the actual legal issues
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
there's no more question of he said this
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
or he said that you can hear the voices
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
you can see what was actually done and
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
we now consider whether something was
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
done properly or improperly so in that
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
regard I would suggest that having body
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
warn cameras actually saves times in
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
cour court because we're no longer
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
questioning what a person said or did we
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
actually get to see the body warn camera
 
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
the footage it also is safer because it
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
helps prevent examples of racism sexism
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
and bad
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
policing if there's an officer who is uh
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly using language that's
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate when addressing
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
individuals um it's going to be
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
captured we live in a state currently as
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
we all know which is mostly homogeneous
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of race especially in the
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
northern part of our state where I
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
practice however the rates of arrest the
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
rates of charges even stops and
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately incarcerations of people of
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
color is significantly higher body warn
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
camera would assure that the color of a
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
person's skin isn't the reason for a
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
stop a detention an arrest and
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately a conviction and
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
incarceration it's simply better for the
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
public it's simply better for our Citi
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and for the police I would also
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
suggest that the good police officer and
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
there are many Among Us um and I'm sorry
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
I have a hand up does that mean that I
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
should entertain a question am I allowed
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that the questions will be asked at
 
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.310 align:start position:0%
that that the questions will be asked at
the

01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
conclusion okay I'm sorry haven't done
 
01:56:10.639 --> 01:56:11.870 align:start position:0%
conclusion okay I'm sorry haven't done
this

01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
before so the as I was saying the video
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
footage saves towns time and money in
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
terms of court cost in terms of
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
uncertainty but it also ensures
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
accountability professionalism and
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
enhances training a supervisor doesn't
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
have to guess at how an officer is
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
behaving out on this on the road a
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor can watch the actual
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
interaction with citizens they can see
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and I can tell stories upon stories
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain officers who
 
01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.069 align:start position:0%
there are certain officers who
ultimately

01:56:44.069 --> 01:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
are repeatedly in conflict with citizens
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
and and it's not
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's very common that those officers
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
know how to rile people up or they're
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
just they're overly aggressive to such a
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
degree that they cause there to be
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
conflicts body warn cameras can help a
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
chief can help a Department's uh
 
01:57:08.109 --> 01:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
officers that are in charge to take
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
control of the situation and help that
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
officer to learn how to lessen the
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
severity or or lessen interactions with
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
citizens it also has added benefits in
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
terms of saving cost because of reducing
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
um actual uh use of force it's there are
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
studies and I believe I submitted some
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
studies to the committee before uh this
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
hearing took place there are studies
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
that show that use of force decrease
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
with the use of bodyw warn camera that
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
when the police know that their
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
interactions are recording that
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
unreasonable behavior or anger or
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
hostility is De escalated it also has
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
been shown that the public feels more
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
trustworthy when they know that their
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
interactions are being recorded it helps
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
us to avoid the situation where we have
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
to guess because we now know what's
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
going on obviously the history this past
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
summer I believe that houseu 253 is more
 
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
important than ever in the past year
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
there have been police shootings and
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
they were shootings that were captured
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
by video and those shootings appear to
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
have been able to be resolved Because
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
the actual evidence
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
existed a lot of times those videos were
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
captured by by cell phones this law
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
would allow there to be a mandatory
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
recording so that we don't have to guess
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
and hope that there's somebody who's
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
nearby I would also point out that it
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
certainly where I practice in Northern
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coos Grafton and Carol
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
counties that there are frequently times
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
when a police officer is alone in fact I
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
I have colleagues that I consider
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
friends in the state police and the most
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
common Trooper on at night is Trooper
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
vacant what that means is that there's
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
no v no trooper that covers a certain
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
area it's not uncommon in Northern New
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that a single Trooper is
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
patrolling Coos and Grafton County
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
geographically that's an area that
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
probably covers three hours in
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
drive that officer is alone in a cruiser
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
any interaction that that officer has
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
when the blue lights go on would be
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
recorded using House Bill
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
253 what that means is that we're not
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to guess about what
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
occurred between that individual officer
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
and the public what it also means is
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a decrease in terms
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
of officers being accused of sexual
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
harassment officers being accused of
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
foul language officer who are accused of
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
misconduct of
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
abuse all of those situations can be
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
humiliated by having body worn footage
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
it just makes sense it makes sense for
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
the public it makes sense for the good
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
Troopers the good individuals that are
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
are in
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
uniform it makes no sense to continue
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
guesswork which is what we currently
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
have I'd like to share another story
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
about a situation that I think it
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
highlights how important video can be I
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
had a case a little while ago where a a
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
young lady accused a bar manager of
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
assaulting her the bar had video
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
recording system the bar video recording
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
system was able to exonerate that person
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was able to show that he was
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
wrongfully accused and
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately gas stations have this
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
technology uh convenience stores have
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
this technology if restaurants and
 
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
stores gas stations have all this
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
technology and it helps alleviate
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
potential thefts it alleviates and helps
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
identify things that could be going on
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
in a in a business what's more important
 
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
than police work in our streets and in
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
our communities I would suggest that the
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
public confidence the public and the
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
police uh assurity knowing that their
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
actions are going to be recorded will
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
help the good police officers will help
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
the citizens to feel safe secure and
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
protected I believe I did submit some
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
data to you and there are certainly
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
different com opponents to that data
 
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
about use of force and the complaints
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
but in short what they do show is that
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
police aggressiveness and recording have
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
been decreased when there is recordings
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
more importantly though the uncertainty
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the ambiguity is eliminated we know
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
what has
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
happened this bill for bodyw warn camera
 
02:01:46.069 --> 02:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
making it man mandatory would protect
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in five ways I would
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
submit that it captures the best
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
evidence of what was said and done
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
second that it leads to accountability
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
for the police and citizens third it
 
02:01:58.350 --> 02:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
saves time in court by eliminating
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
issues and reducing frivolous arguments
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
and lawsuits it provides valuable
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
training to officers who can their
 
02:02:09.629 --> 02:02:09.639 align:start position:0%
supervisors can use it it allows the
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
police academy to actually determine
 
02:02:13.629 --> 02:02:13.639 align:start position:0%
whether somebody is a problem if they
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
have sexist if they have racist if they
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
have other aggressive tendencies which
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
need to be uh made that that the
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
authority needs to know better they
 
02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
actually lower the cost to ensure good
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
quality procedures and protections are
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
followed and I think as the uh the
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative indicated who was
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the bill there already are
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
protocols in place for storage and
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance and those are legitimate
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns I can tell you candidly working
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
with the towns like Lisbon and Berlin
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
and hail the towns that are among the
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
the poorest in the state that those
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
towns have fewer trials fewer conflicts
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
and save money because of this they do
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
have an administrator who provides the
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
video to my office or a defense counsil
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
that requests it or a citizen that
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
requests it what's even more important
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
about that is that this the cost of this
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
provides integrity and ensures public
 
02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
confidence when you can actually watch
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
an interaction and the the Attorney
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
General's release these videos that have
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
resulted in fatalities people can feel
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
this was a Justified fatal shooting or
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
they may feel that it's not but it
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
provides daily access the the sixth
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
reason to support this would be that it
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
provides daily access to police work
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
allowing supervisors judges and citizens
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
to feel confident in short I would
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
conclude by saying that this is good
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
policy and it should be approved for the
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
citizens for the police and for the
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
betterman of New Hampshire
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative baling you recognize for
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I hope you
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
can hear
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
me um I thought it was interesting you
 
02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
said that the use of body cameras um
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
would reduce the cost of a case as I
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand it our courts are funded
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
through the same mechanism that F this
 
02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
bill so are you saying that we can save
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
money with this
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
bill I think the C yes I I think that
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
the the situation I I can just give you
 
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
a a a brief story when when there's an
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
accusation of uh somebody says that they
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
hit another person and it's captured by
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
Body warn camera there's no longer an
 
02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
argument that the person said that it's
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
it's on film or if they actually get to
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
the scene or they watch a person driving
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
across the yellow line there's no
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
argument that they cross the yellow line
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
at the stop was
 
02:04:53.549 --> 02:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
legitimate and for for years before
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
these towns had bodyw warn camera we
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
would certainly argue about whether
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
there was an actual admission or whether
 
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
impairment represent B Bing you
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
recognize for a followup thank you Mr
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
chair have you heard of any situations
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
in which someone made an accusation
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
against police that was disproven using
 
02:05:21.629 --> 02:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I I would say that I have heard
 
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
that I've also had the situation where
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
an officer has forgotten that the bodyw
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
warn camera is on and indicated that a a
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
defendant made a statement and the
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
statement wasn't actually made so it's
 
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard and seen both um and I would
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
say that the when people are in
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
emotional heightened States they don't
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
remember what happened as well as they
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
do in a normal calm state so the body
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
warn camera actually captures a person's
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
actions and words and I've seen it where
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
police have said things um that were
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
disproven and I've seen it where
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
citizens have said things and it's been
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
disproven and I've also seen the
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
opposite where the police say it and
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
then it's verified by the video and when
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
the citizen says it so it it really I
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
think is a is essential to helping our
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
system be more able to determine the
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
Knight um thank you chairman and thank
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question um you
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
spoke in your testimony about two
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
different towns one you gave an example
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
that had body cameras and one that did
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
not in your legal experience or time in
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
this profession can you can you give us
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
a rough estimate on how much a town pays
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
or using the ones in your testimony
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
versus how much they pay out of pocket
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit where they don't have evidence
 
02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
such as this versus how much they pay
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
how much a town pays when they do have
 
02:07:13.069 --> 02:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
this evidence I I can't give you any
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
numbers I am I practice exclusively in
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
criminal defense so I don't know what
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
the cost is to end suit but the towns I
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
believe do have legal counsel that I
 
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
know I know the lawyers from fton W um
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
frequently are involved in defending
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
these cases and they certainly spend um
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funds I I see that
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
a representative is hand up maybe he
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
answer Mr chairman um actually this is a
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
um do you since this bill doesn't have a
 
02:07:55.229 --> 02:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
financial note does this this bill go to
 
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee that is a great question and
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
and I I'm wondering why it does not have
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
any type of fiscal note makes it really
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate that issue and I know that the
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
custom is is that we're really supposed
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
to consider just the legality of that
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
and not the fiscal side of it but I have
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
a hard time ignoring that or following
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
that customer
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
s so I'm not sure if
 
02:08:26.559 --> 02:08:31.589 align:start position:0%
s so I'm not sure if
this

02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
should well then there's a 28a issue I
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
understand that I
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't we can discuss that more in
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
executive session I I don't know if this
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
will go to a second committee but it
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
certainly should go to a second
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
Committee in my
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
CH if I may ask a question and I just
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
want to thank you in advance uh for
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question it it says
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
under under the paragraph five that
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
you the person who the police officer
 
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
encounters has to consent to being
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
recorded So
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there any estimation on how often
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
people ask to not be recorded So I feel
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
like there I agree that there's a lot of
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
positive that will happen for both
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
prosecution and defense by having these
 
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know encounters recorded but if the
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
person they encounter ask them to turn
 
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.189 align:start position:0%
person they encounter ask them to turn
it

02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
off all that's out out the door and then
 
02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559 align:start position:0%
just curious if you know how often that
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
happens I I can't give you an actual
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
number but but I can tell you that um in
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
my experience the cases that I have seen
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I I very rarely I would say it and
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
this is anecdotal but I would say it's
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
less than 1% of the time that people ask
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
to have the camera shut off um typically
 
02:10:06.189 --> 02:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
the encounters that I see are motor
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle stops an officer normally walks
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
up to a person and indicates sir ma'am
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're being recorded I'm letting you
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
know that you're being audio and video
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
recorded and then they say license and
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
registration and they're off um I can't
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
think of a case where I've had a citizen
 
02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
indicate I don't want to be recorded I
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
have had cases where um people are
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
making allegations of sexual nature and
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
personal nature and they've indicated
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
that they would have lik to to go into a
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
room where there's not a recording and
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
they've also I've also seen cases where
 
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
people have gone into a room where they
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide information or
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
intelligence about drug dealing and
 
02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
again they they asked not to be
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
recorded and those are in departments
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
that typically do recording of
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
interactions so in my experience I have
 
02:11:02.589 --> 02:11:02.599 align:start position:0%
not seen people um demand that and
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's currently in our in our law as as
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
well that it has to be a the the
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
existing voluntary body warn statute I
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no oh excuse me representative
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
hoer thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question what about a
 
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance where the uh person in
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
question is uh incapacitate
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and can't give consent uh
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
traffic accident the person's injured or
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
they're drunk and they're not in any
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
position to give consent to
 
02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:49.229 align:start position:0%
position to give consent to
any

02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
I can't answer all situations but I can
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
tell you that I've certainly seen a lot
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
of body warn camera of people that are
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
incapacitated so um I know what happens
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't I think it's more a situation
 
02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
that a person has to actually assert the
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
right to not be recorded and as long as
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
there a person has been advised that an
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
interaction is recording I also think
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns that I I know is
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to be raised is the uh issue of
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
civil liberties and whether we should be
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
recording people with without their
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that's what
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
this portion of the statute actually
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
addresses is that a person can demand
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
not to be recorded and it has to be a
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
volitional act to say that I do not want
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
to be recorded um but again I would
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
point out the the common occurrence if
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
you work in a convenience store go to a
 
02:12:42.189 --> 02:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
gas station you're recorded if you go to
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
Walmart you're recorded I mean we're all
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
being recorded um all the time we we may
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
not have audio in Walmart but we're
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
certainly being recorded there's
 
02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
monitors on our lives I think it's
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to protect our
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and our police by recording
 
02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.950 align:start position:0%
citizens and our police by recording
their

02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Pratt I have a
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
question is this
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
video Freedom of Information
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
material I'm sorry you broke up sir I
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you um is this information
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
available the Freedom of Information Act
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
so somebody said I want to see the video
 
02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:23.559 align:start position:0%
of so install stop the other day would
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
they be able to get that information
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
from loc the there's actually the the
 
02:13:31.950 --> 02:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
current law prohibits this from being
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
disseminated through the Freedom of
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
Information Act there are situations and
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are protocols that a person can
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
get it
 
02:13:41.470 --> 02:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
revealed um but generally speaking it's
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
not permitted there's a there's a fairly
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh tight window if you will allowing
 
02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.709 align:start position:0%
uh tight window if you will allowing
dissemination

02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.719 --> 02:13:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
Ms just one uh one quick question we
 
02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:02.599 align:start position:0%
were talking a little bit earlier uh
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
about the benefits of requiring this
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
versus making it optional in your mind
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits of doing this
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
uniformly across the state I I think
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
they're off the charts fantastic um one
 
02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
of uh the benefits that have from having
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
done this for a while is I go to
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
seminars across the country and I can
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
tell you that in other states in
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
particular I know South Carolina has a
 
02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory requirement and they'
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
centralized all of their video um body
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
warn cameras and Cruiser cameras and
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's available to the defendants
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
lawyers without anyone having you
 
02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
basically have a password and it allows
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
you to watch them it streamlined it
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
enormously one of the things that most
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
is is my one of my biggest concerns is
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire State Police
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
simply don't use body warn camera or
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
cruiser camera and they're probably the
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
mo they I without a doubt they're the
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
most well-funded
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
agency that I deal with and I think
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's no good reason for them to be
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to it I think it ultimately it
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
streamlines cases completely it
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
eliminates credibility issues and it
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
protects officers and the public from
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
false allegations um but think making it
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
uniform is essential to making it um to
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
helping to pay for it because the towns
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
currently that are doing so like Berlin
 
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
and havil and Lisbon are among the
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
poorest towns in the state and they have
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
seen the benefits of it and it it just I
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
think if you had more towns bigger towns
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
that were participating the the benefits
 
02:15:43.229 --> 02:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
would continue to grow exponentially so
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
I I absolutely would encourage uniform
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
application of a bodyw warn statute it
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense in every possible
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
conceivable way that I can
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
you seeing no hand hands raised I want
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
to thank the witness for his testimony
 
02:16:05.159 --> 02:16:16.270 align:start position:0%
to thank the witness for his testimony
thank

02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:16.280 align:start position:0%

02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.990 --> 02:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think you called On Me
 
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:55.950 align:start position:0%

02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be very brief in my
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
remarks uh for the record my name is
 
02:17:31.870 --> 02:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
David Goldstein I'm the chief of police
 
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
for the city of Franklin I've been a
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
police officer for 41 years and 16 of
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
those years in two separate police
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
departments both which have been
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
financially strapped police departments
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
by the way this morning I do represent
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of chiefs
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
of police and we are taking a neutral
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
position on HB 253 at this time for the
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
most part Chiefs are not opposed to U
 
02:17:57.629 --> 02:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
the use of body cameras however it is
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
the funding issue that brings us uh
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
before you today uh and we feel that to
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
some degree some of what's been written
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
up in this bill may be somewhat
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
shortsighted um there are often grants
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh available for police departments to
 
02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
purchase install and Implement body
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
cameras but those monies have a tendency
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
to dry up very rapidly after after the
 
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
fact and here in Franklin we've
 
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
experienced that twice with our Cruiser
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
cameras uh so there's very little money
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
for sustainability of the um of the
 
02:18:31.629 --> 02:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
initiative many departments have found
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
that other costs are storage
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
administrative cost data retrieval and
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act requests to
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
name a few and according to the police
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
uh Executive Research Foundation uh
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the department
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
obviously costs are very uh large
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
consideration and their research in 2018
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that for a large Department
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
such as uh Manchester or Nash you'd be
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
talking somewhere in the vicity of $1.4
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
million uh just to just for the agency
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
cost the uh storage Etc for a large
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
agency like that would be close to $4
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
million a year according to um according
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
to what per found obviously for smaller
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
agencies uh such as my my agency and
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
others in the state which is the
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
majority we're speaking much less but
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
they're looking at figures of around
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
$997,000 um to implement the program and
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
storage costs uh certainly are expensive
 
02:19:32.669 --> 02:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
as well so that is uh on
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
record we question the source of the
 
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
funding uh somewhere in the in the bill
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned about the penalty
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
assessment uh contributing to this quite
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
frankly that's been declining for a
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
number of years and that's why the
 
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
legislature a few years ago opted to
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
take the the funding of the police
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
academy out of the penalty assessment
 
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
and give it to the general fund uh
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
because we no longer um uh collect the
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
fees that we once did and in fact at the
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
time and I testified on that bill some
 
02:20:05.950 --> 02:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
years ago at the time um there was a he
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
said she said type of argument between
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
AOC and law enforcement and that we were
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining and and asserting that the
 
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
courts were not uh collecting um penalty
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
assessment in the courts are telling us
 
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
we weren't charging people with the uh
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
with the violations so you can leave
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
that to your imagination as well
 
02:20:27.309 --> 02:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
questions that we do have is how do
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
these allocations work certainly the
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill has made reference to the fact that
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office will come
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
up with some sort of Grant proposal and
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
program but when you're a small
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
Department such as mine or chief a
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
Becky's eventually when he speaks uh as
 
02:20:43.469 --> 02:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
compared to let's say a Manchester
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
nashille or any large town for that
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
matter such as Derry London Derry or
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
Salem uh do we get the leftovers and
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
they get the The Lion Share of the of
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
the monies that's not meant to be
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
negative that's meant to be a legitimate
 
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
question and certainly uh if we do
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
initiate the process what happens if the
 
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.110 align:start position:0%
initiate the process what happens if the
funding

02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
decreases or actually disappears are we
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
then in violation of Statute and are we
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
now under again an unfunded mandate we
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
do feel that the bill can work certainly
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
and as I said we're more than happy to
 
02:21:20.429 --> 02:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
participate in any process that'll bring
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
us these um bring us up to date with all
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
of these um initiatives however we feel
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
that we need some more work on it it's
 
02:21:29.550 --> 02:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
not ready as I've heard so many times in
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee not ready for Prime Time thank
 
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.389 --> 02:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you chief for your
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%

yes represent represent n you recognize
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%

02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair have an
 
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
approximate number of how many do and
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
not representative
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
you chief for taking my question um we
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about the 28a
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
costs and usually there are costs that
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
you can predict like um
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
funding um when organizations like yours
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you know if your organization or any
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
others when they figure the funding cost
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
include those predictable costs and take
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
into account also the reductions that
 
02:22:40.319 --> 02:22:41.309 align:start position:0%
into account also the reductions that
are

02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
potential that we heard from previous
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
witnesses that indicate that there could
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
be even a greater or maybe even a much
 
02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
greater um
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
cost savings if you did not if the town
 
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
or the city did not have to do the
 
02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
litigation that they may do now which
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
might be eliminated by the use of body
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
cameras do you have any information on
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of um
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
sure that's an excellent question
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative um certainly when we
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
prepare our budget every year we go
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
through all of these machinations
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
and we try to predict what we're going
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
to need what we're not going to need uh
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of this for example is
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
court time uh so for for instance if we
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a very busy year I'm paying a lot
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
of money in court time if we have a less
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
busy year I'm paying less money in court
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
time so certainly we try to go through
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
these these calculations with things
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
such as uh body cams uh first and
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
foremost you have to remember that
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
communities such as Franklin and
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester are tax cap cities so our
 
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
city managers have to come in on budget
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
period it's against the law for her not
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
to do that so right then and there I can
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
certainly ask for let's say $100,000
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
round figures uh for body cams to try to
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
alleviate any difficulties that might be
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
forthcoming but certainly uh that money
 
02:24:05.950 --> 02:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't predictable at this
 
02:24:07.469 --> 02:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
particular point in time at least for
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
Franklin I can only speak certainly for
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
my own City uh as far as litigation
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
issues are concerned I heard what
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
council had to say and I certainly
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that how however I can tell
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
you in 11 years here as Chief in
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
Franklin we have not had one lawsuit uh
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a pretty good record
 
02:24:25.870 --> 02:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
now that doesn't mean that tomorrow we
 
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
won't but certainly that that speaks to
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
the professionalism of this particular
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
police department and the people that
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
serve this particular community so I
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
think that you're talking about a lot of
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
um abstract uh numbers here as well but
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
certainly to answer your question in
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
totality uh we are uh always playing
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that type of scenario game if you
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
will what if what will we need so on and
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
so forth and many's a year that I've
 
02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
gone without new Cruisers because of
 
02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:55.790 align:start position:0%
gone without new Cruisers because of
budget

02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
concerns I hope that help thank you no
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thorough question I
 
02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:02.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thorough question I
qu

02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
qu
 
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking my
 
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
question uh our previous witness uh
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that uh there are
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
some communities up in po like uh
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think ha
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
R and Berlin that he mentioned already
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
have in our using body Cs and um the
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
fact that those towns don't have
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
especially bright phical pictures either
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm curious if you know just how
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.269 --> 02:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry representative I lost the
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
last part of that it broke up sure I'm
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know how community like
 
02:25:52.349 --> 02:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
Berlin uh Franklin and Lisbon uh who who
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of Revenue and have
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
Financial issues uh have been managed to
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
have have been able uh to manage to
 
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
afford to equip their police officers
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
with body camps uh in the absence of a
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
requirement from the state uh or from a
 
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism like the one in the
 
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill certainly and I can't really answer
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
for those departments because I don't
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
work for them and nor do they work for
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
me but uh again I can make perhaps an
 
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
educated guess to some degree here and
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
say that they have made that a priority
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh for their budgetary considerations in
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
their in their respective towns um and
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
that certainly knowing those towns as I
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
do uh their activity levels are a little
 
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
bit less than we are down here in the
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
central and southern tiers of the State
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh Etc so that does take a u take its
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
toll uh financially and again uh being a
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
tax cap Community uh we have to come in
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
on point uh one year my manager came in
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
18 cents under the budget the required
 
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
budget that's how specific and precise
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
these budgets are so uh I still have to
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
pay um uh benefits I still have to pay
 
02:27:06.269 --> 02:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
salaries I still have to pay court time
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
I still have to pay overtime Etc equip
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
my officers buy new Cruisers and all
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
that just like everybody else so it's
 
02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
what the community will bear it would be
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
Muse you recognize for a followup
 
02:27:21.359 --> 02:27:27.309 align:start position:0%
Muse you recognize for a followup
question

02:27:27.309 --> 02:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank actually I think uh I think you
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
actually answered my question um thank
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
welcome representative true thank you Mr
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chief for taking my
 
02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
question you had given some an example
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
of a yearly cost say for the city of
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh could you uh run those
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
past us again I think it was maybe a
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year for equipment and
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
four million for storage or what what
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
was what was that money for this the the
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
figures I have uh were for by perf again
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's the Police Executive Research
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation uh they do a lot of work for
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
us obviously research Etc
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
um they came out with some general costs
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh certainly uh the uh larger
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
agencies they considered it 250 sworn
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
plus officers so their maximum agency
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
cost in that regard which Manchester
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
might well fit into would be um in 2018
 
02:28:40.030 --> 02:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
was 1 uh3 almost $1.4
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
million uh to fund the uh initiative
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.070 align:start position:0%
million uh to fund the uh initiative
cameras

02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
Etc were uh excuse me storage was $4
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
million um per year for a large agency
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
now certainly we're probably talking uh
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
agencies that far exceed those here in
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well so these are just
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
general figures but the point of the
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
matter that we've all discussed amongst
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves as well as with our our our
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
bodies whether it be select persons or
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
councils city councils is the fact that
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
these are still very expensive
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
propositions for us to uh to engage in
 
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
and as a result we have to be very very
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
frugal and decide what best what's the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
best program for each and every
 
02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:33.630 align:start position:0%
best program for each and every
individual

02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
Department seeing no further hands
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
raised I want to thank you chief for
 
02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:42.040 align:start position:0%

my testimony today again my name is
 
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
Sophia Bondo I'm 14 I live in Manchester
 
02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire High School Democrats in
 
02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
support of
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
hp253 I am in support of hp253 because I
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe that it is a bill that can
 
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
receive bipartisan support and will make
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
a meaningful difference in our state
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
requiring body cameras for police make
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
sense they can be used by police
 
02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
departments as a training tool and to
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
determine when police take courageous
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
actions to protect our communities they
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
can also be used to bring Justice for B
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
victims of unlawful and potentially
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
deadly conduct body cameras raise
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
awareness and accountability for both
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
the good and the bad in our police
 
02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
forces the usual financial implications
 
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
of a change like this may also be a sing
 
02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
point for some of you however this bill
 
02:31:00.269 --> 02:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
lays out a grant system to pay for the
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
cameras that is Created from
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
appropriating just 1% of funds from the
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment fund so in conclusion
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
under hp253 the police will benefit the
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
people will benefit and the taxpayers
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
will not be impacted please show young
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
people like me that bipartisanship is
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
still possible in politics today and
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.429 --> 02:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:42.630 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
witnesses

02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
excuse chief
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:57.510 align:start position:0%
excuse chief
hcky

Chief you may you may begin your
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
testimony can you hear me uh CH Mr
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yes we can Mr chairman members
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Joo Becky
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of police in Hollis I'm
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
also the first vice president for the
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs Police Association
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
I testify today um really as a neutral
 
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
position on behalf of this bill um I
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
felt inclined I I didn't plan to testify
 
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
however I felt inclined uh to just say a
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
few words about this uh proposed
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh my agency Hallis PD we
 
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
are of an an agency of 16 police
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
officers we currently have body cameras
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
we've had body cameras since
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
2016 we recently updated to a integrated
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh Cruiser camera
 
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
body camera system actually as of last
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
week we did that and I can tell you that
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
the cost over a 5year period is
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
$160,000 um and that includes the
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
equipment in the cloud storage which is
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
considerably uh which is the most um the
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
highest proportion of the uh the costs
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
associated with the program
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
itself um I do know that Chief aldenberg
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
from Manchester has the same body warn
 
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
camera system that we have here in
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hollis and I believe he's listening and
 
02:33:25.389 --> 02:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
he can certainly provide you um some
 
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
ideas on um the cost of the program uh
 
02:33:32.110 --> 02:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
from his agency which is a a very large
 
02:33:35.469 --> 02:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
a agency of course I will say this that
 
02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
I was uh a member of the leak
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislation workg group committee and um
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
so we worked on Senate Bill
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
96 which includes language relative to
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
setting up a fund in the state budget
 
02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of body warn camera in
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
incar camera
 
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
systems um I certainly think that this
 
02:34:00.269 --> 02:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
is probably a better Avenue uh in terms
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
of trying to fund this important program
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
I am a firm believer in body warn
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
cameras and agree very much with the the
 
02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
testimony of the previous
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um I would say that in terms
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
of reduced litigation I have not really
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
seen a reduction in
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
litigation uh because we do have body
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
camera systems in terms of uh criminal
 
02:34:25.269 --> 02:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
prosecution of course we haven't had any
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuits thankfully um but certainly I
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that there you know the use
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
of body cameras has resulted in a
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in uh criminal prosecutions or
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
criminal cases of of any sort so I can't
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
really speak to that because I can't
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
quantify that for you at this time I
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
will say I do have concerns with funding
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
it through the penalty assessment if you
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
recall and I know uh Chief Goldstein
 
02:34:53.269 --> 02:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
testified to this uh the police academy
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
used to be funded by the penalty
 
02:34:58.110 --> 02:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
assessment fee um their budget their
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
annual budget is about $3 and A5
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
million and we found that the penalty
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
assessment fee was insufficient to fund
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
a $3.5 million B uh budget I can tell
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
you that body cameras a body warn camera
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
system throughout the state a mandatory
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
system would be far more than $3.5
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
million um so just to put that into
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
context I am more than happy to work
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
with members of the committee or any
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to help figure out
 
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
innovative ways to fund this I believe
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
in the program I believe in the system I
 
02:35:33.150 --> 02:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
think it helps increases
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
transparency and so as such I will Avail
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
myself to assisting in whatever capacity
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
I can as a chief of police with that uh
 
02:35:43.710 --> 02:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
this concludes my testimony I'll open it
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you chief for your
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
c um thank you chair um thank you for
 
02:35:59.469 --> 02:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you find Body
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
camps to be a win-win situation for both
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
the um officers as well as the public is
 
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Muse
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Chief
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
um uh it uh it sounds like you are a
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
participant on the on the leak
 
02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
commission uh so uh I'm hoping you may
 
02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
have some insight into uh into uh some
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
additional insight into s sp96 does s
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
sp96 the Senate Bill actually require
 
02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
body cams to be worn which this bill
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
does so representative Muse so I was um
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
actually on the work group the
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
legislative work group so I can't speak
 
02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the the commission uh but
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
what I will say is initially yes
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
initially we were going to mandate that
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
departments uh were required to have
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
bodyw warn camera uh systems however
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
when I explained how significant the
 
02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:06.830 align:start position:0%
when I explained how significant the
cost

02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:37:09.389 --> 02:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
was uh it was pretty clear it would
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
become an unfunded mandate it just
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be realistic to accomplish that
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
objective without some some source of
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
funding realistic source of funding and
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
so we changed um the language um to set
 
02:37:28.750 --> 02:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
up a fund um in the budget the state
 
02:37:33.269 --> 02:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
budget for purchase of bodyw camera uh
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
and incar camera systems uh at a future
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
time and I think that's a more logical
 
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
approach let's face it if I had you know
 
02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
a magic wand I would wave it today and
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
everyone would have these in the state
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
that just that's just what I believe but
 
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
I'm one Chief and I'm fortunate enough
 
02:37:53.950 --> 02:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
to have support in terms of funding this
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
program so I hope I answered your
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
question sir thank
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
Newman uh thank you chair Mr chair and
 
02:38:06.750 --> 02:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for taking my
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
question um I was recorded for 26 years
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
as an air traffic controller and I found
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
that there was a benefit in recording
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
for training and in fact even lawsuits
 
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
where trainees alleg that they were not
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
trained properly do you see any uh
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
benefits like that might ACR from the
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
fact that you do have body
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
camera AB absolutely
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
um you know there there's always a
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
training component uh in terms of these
 
02:38:40.750 --> 02:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
videos um
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
additionally it ensures that when we
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
conduct Internal Affairs in
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
investigations that we have the best
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
information and evidence available in
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
order to come to a impartial and fair
 
02:38:57.309 --> 02:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
finding on a given complaint or
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
allegation of
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
impropriety and I can tell you that the
 
02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
body warn cameras have resulted um in
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
officers being cleared of wrong
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing and they've also allowed us
 
02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
to hold officers accountable for any uh
 
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
minor or major policy violations of such
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so you know in my humble opinion as a
 
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement practitioner I mean
 
02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you want a tool that
 
02:39:27.269 --> 02:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
provides a higher level of transparency
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
and does many of the things of which
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair for a followup
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
um do you think there's any possibility
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
that these unknown benefits that would
 
02:39:50.429 --> 02:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
have a very very hard time to uh figure
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
what the C what the savings of them
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be could possibly outweigh the um
 
02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
the drawbacks uh that we suffer due to
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
tax caps and uh
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
the yeah I think um with every cost
 
02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a saving
 
02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere um um so I look at it you know
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
strictly from the aspect of civil
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
litigation I
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
mean if there is an allegation of
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
impropriety or misconduct that results
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
in um civil litigation that results in
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
settlement um the reality is those costs
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
could probably fund a bodyw warn camera
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
system for our
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
agency for many years over um so I look
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
at it in terms of that you know cost
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis um and you know real my
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
job as a chief representative is to m is
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
to mitigate risk you know and sometimes
 
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
when you mitigate risk there's a price
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
tag that's associated with it and that's
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
the reality of it but I would not be
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
doing my job in mitigating risk if I
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
didn't provide my officers with the best
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
tools available to keep them safe to
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
make sure they're operating in a highly
 
02:41:10.479 --> 02:41:12.030 align:start position:0%
make sure they're operating in a highly
transparent

02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
environment and then you know providing
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
a even higher level of uh uh
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
accountability for them for both good
 
02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:23.310 align:start position:0%
and bad because it work it works both
 
02:41:23.310 --> 02:41:25.950 align:start position:0%
and bad because it work it works both

you representative
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
board thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
chief for uh taking my question
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
um I did hear that you are not your
 
02:41:46.269 --> 02:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
department doesn't necessarily have body
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
worn cameras have you asked your funding
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
agency probably visable government to uh
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
fund such
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
apparatus uh representative we we do
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
actually have them we've had them since
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
2016 and uh we recently updated to a new
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
system which provides some better
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
capabilities represent board a followup
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
Chief um so did you have to allocate for
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh body War cameras were or did the city
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
that you work for uh
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
mandated um so so we were not mandated
 
02:42:34.990 --> 02:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
um we proactively um entered into an
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
agreement in 2016 in which we followed
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
the you know um appropriate budgetary
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and funding
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
requirements this time around um we had
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
planned to fund this new program in the
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement plan which would
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
take effect in 2021 April of
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
2021 however it became aware to us that
 
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
the cost would significantly increase
 
02:43:04.349 --> 02:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
come January 1 so what we did do by the
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
some vacancies and such we had some
 
02:43:09.309 --> 02:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
Surplus in our 2020 fiscal year budget
 
02:43:11.790 --> 02:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
we were able to fund the first year and
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
that allowed us with the opportunity to
 
02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
lock in that price before the costs
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
increased uh on January 1st so we knew
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
we were going to do this and we were
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to actually save a little bit of
 
02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
money to the taxpayer by um being
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
creative with our budget process I again
 
02:43:30.950 --> 02:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think it comes down to what chap
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
goldsteen said you know if agencies make
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
this a priority they'll do the their
 
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
best to find the funding for
 
02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
sir representative m
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
Chief do you think that there's any
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh communities um working
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
together or or do you know maybe in
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
other states if uh if communities and
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities actually work together to
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
do things like get cloud storage at
 
02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
lower prices to buy equipment in larger
 
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
Lots so um is there a
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
way we have if we do if we do choose to
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
make requirement uh do you think there
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
are ways that um that the cost could be
 
02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
brought down for communities through
 
02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:23.469 align:start position:0%
brought down for communities through
smarter

02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
smarter
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
purchasing yeah I do I think
 
02:44:29.110 --> 02:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I think very much like with
 
02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
the state bid
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
program if the state were to release
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
some type of RFP and I believe they're
 
02:44:37.950 --> 02:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
working on this for body War camera
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
systems and identify you know lowcost
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
vendor um that agencies could enter into
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
agreements to have a lower funded or a
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
lower cost body War camera system or
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
maybe even you know bulk based on region
 
02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
or at the state level I mean there's a
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
lot of logistics that would go into it
 
02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
but I do believe there's some
 
02:45:02.910 --> 02:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that and if you look
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
we kind of do that already with
 
02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
integrated um r with radio
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
interoperability and uh combined
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
dispatch centers with police and fire
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
and regionalized centers so I think the
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
stru is there I think it's just how we
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
can best approach this but really the
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
funding part is the most important piece
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
and if we don't do that it would be like
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
having a car with an engine you know you
 
02:45:28.830 --> 02:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
can't drive the car without the engine
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
so I I think we have to have that
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
realistic logical funding mechanism in
 
02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:37.429 align:start position:0%
realistic logical funding mechanism in
place

02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
first representative you recognize for
 
02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:40.870 align:start position:0%
first representative you recognize for
PA

02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
PA
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
question um one of one of the things
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
kind of curious about is um your
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
reaction instead of the idea body cams
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
you know optional versus
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
required um perhaps extending uh
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
creating a timeline uh that would uh
 
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
phase in uh it would actually phase it
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
in as a requirement uh over a period of
 
02:46:13.469 --> 02:46:13.479 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three years um that would
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
seem to give community the ability to
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
take advantage you know of Grants when
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're available of maybe a better year
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
than this one on the budget cycle is
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is that something that
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh you would be open
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
to yeah I mean I don't want to speak for
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
every Chief in the state but if I was
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
looking as a means to intitute Institute
 
02:46:38.349 --> 02:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
this program I think you know the whole
 
02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
having a realistic funding mechanism and
 
02:46:43.630 --> 02:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
then some type of obtainable timeline in
 
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
order to do this
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
um it certainly doesn't benefit us that
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're in the midst of a global pandemic
 
02:46:51.070 --> 02:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of budgetary
 
02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
restrictions on this but you know for
 
02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
example States like New Jersey with some
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh recommendations following the
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
incidents from this past year I believe
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
New Jersey made it a mandatory
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that body cameras be used by
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
agencies in that state but what they did
 
02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
do was set up a state fund for it for
 
02:47:12.030 --> 02:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
agencies to purchase the equipment with
 
02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
so you know again I think the funding
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
piece is most important and as you know
 
02:47:18.429 --> 02:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
representative that's always the piece
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
debated hope I answered your question
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes you did thank
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you and uh see no further
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
hands up I will excuse the
 
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
witness thank you sir before I call the
 
02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
next witness given
 
02:47:41.070 --> 02:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
the unticipated amount of time that this
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
just took we're probably going to have
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
to work for the lunch break so if any
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
member wants to take a five or 10 minute
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
break on the on their own
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
time feel fre to do that but we're going
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to have to get through a lot of the we
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
have we're behind already we have two
 
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
bills this
 
02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:58.630 align:start position:0%
bills this
afternoon

02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
so use that as your
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
discretion calling the next witness will
 
02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.870 align:start position:0%
discretion calling the next witness will
will

02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
Stewart so I I can limit testimony going
 
02:48:13.710 --> 02:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
forward there was only three Witnesses
 
02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
signed up on the list for more raised
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
the hand thereafter
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
and my it's the purpose of the chair
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that if I do limit testimony that is
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
limited start to finish so unfortunately
 
02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh going forward I'm probably going to
 
02:48:31.950 --> 02:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
limit testimon on every every Bill and
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
essentially the amount of questions we
 
02:48:37.550 --> 02:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
frame and especially when we're talk
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
Tas

02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can you hear
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
me yes we can excellent sorry for the
 
02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
delay there uh just got let back in for
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
the record uh my name is Will Stewart
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of stay work
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
play New Hampshire which is a Statewide
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit whose mission is to attract
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
and retain more young people here in the
 
02:49:07.550 --> 02:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
granite state and here today to speak
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
very briefly appreciate uh the time the
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee is putting into this uh
 
02:49:13.389 --> 02:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
hearing uh but here to speak today in
 
02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
favor of uh of how Bill 253 so by way of
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
explanation I will say that attracting
 
02:49:21.950 --> 02:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
and retaining more young people here is
 
02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
critical to the future of New Hampshire
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh as you may know we're the second
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
oldest state in the country with one of
 
02:49:29.229 --> 02:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
the lowest unemployment rates and on top
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
of this we're the number one exporter of
 
02:49:32.349 --> 02:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
high school graduates seeking a
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
four-year degree so 62% of these young
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
people leave the state every year and
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
some eventually come back but many don't
 
02:49:42.229 --> 02:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
so in short New Hampshire needs all the
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
people that we can get just in general
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
and then all the the young people we can
 
02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
get in particular our businesses need
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
workers and customers our towns need
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer board members our nonprofits
 
02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
churches and Civic clubs all need
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers to accomplish their vital
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
missions uh without which our
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
communities just can't function so about
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
three years ago stor play commissioned
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
this big survey to collect data on why
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
young people stay in and might leave New
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one of the reasons we
 
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
found that young people might leave is
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
due to our state's lack of diversity and
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
we heard this over and over again last
 
02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
fall and winter as we talked to young
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
people all across the state in nine
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
locations um as part of our policy and
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
pint series and indeed New Hampshire's
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
lack of diversity was a top three reason
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
that young people cited for potentially
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
leaving New Hampshire and so as a result
 
02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
of these findings increasing diversity
 
02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusion here in New
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has become a policy priority
 
02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
for stay workk play and it's the reason
 
02:50:41.269 --> 02:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
that we support House Bill 253 today
 
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
which seeks to increase accountability
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
from and Trust in law enforcement which
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh is very necessary if we want to attra
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
attract and retain more people of color
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for your attention and
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
consideration of um supporting House
 
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair committee members can
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
you hear me yes we can thank you very
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
much I am the director of Professional
 
02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
Standards for the New Hampshire
 
02:51:28.190 --> 02:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and the New
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections is
 
02:51:32.349 --> 02:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill with a requested
 
02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I will first say that body
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
warn cameras are essential to the
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
correction setting for the same reasons
 
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
that have been articulated already by
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Harding and the chief of police
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
um that have already spoken to
 
02:51:52.229 --> 02:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
you quest that we have is that right now
 
02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
105d um the state of New Hampshire
 
02:51:59.070 --> 02:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections has obtained a
 
02:52:03.389 --> 02:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
grant for a number of body warn cameras
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
that Grant however is not sufficient to
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
cover all of the areas that we would
 
02:52:11.469 --> 02:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
like to cover the current language as it
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
is drafted and the bill is introduced
 
02:52:17.309 --> 02:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
limits what we believe the Department of
 
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections ability to get any grants
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
that might be obtainable under this new
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
law so for example and I did submit
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
testimony already but unfortunately
 
02:52:31.790 --> 02:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
there was an error in the testimony
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
where I spoke about line 20 what uh
 
02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're actually looking to do if you on
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
page one in the bill as introduced at
 
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
line 13 and at line
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
16 on page one we want to eliminate the
 
02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
word police and maybe it we don't know
 
02:52:56.110 --> 02:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
that it's definitely needed but if you
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
need a different Lang a different um set
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
of words in there to put for certified
 
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers so the
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
provision would
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
read at line starting on line 12 as
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
provided in this chapter this fund shall
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
be used to pay the cost of local count
 
02:53:19.630 --> 02:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
and state use and then strike the word
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
police or of um police body War cameras
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
and add for certified law enforcement
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
officers and the same would be at line
 
02:53:33.389 --> 02:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
16 striking the word police warn body
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
cameras and putting in body warn cameras
 
02:53:39.630 --> 02:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
for certified law enforcement
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
officers and with those changes the
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections again supports
 
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:47.880 align:start position:0%

Bill good morning chairman abbis members
 
02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm representative Pat
 
02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
long representing Hillsboro district 10
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
within the city of
 
02:55:43.150 --> 02:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester H Bill 375 as a result of a
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
request from lieutenant Louie of the
 
02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department that I had
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
a discussion with to understand the
 
02:55:50.670 --> 02:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
problem and look for its potential
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions my first question was on Val
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
valueless Contraband we all place value
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
on items that uh may have value to us
 
02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
however it has no value to someone else
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was explained to me that items that
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
are that are taking up valuable space in
 
02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
the evidence room for example a backpack
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
with to brush dirty socks and underwear
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
also property that the auctioneer would
 
02:56:15.469 --> 02:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
not include in an auction
 
02:56:16.990 --> 02:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
um that in their opinion would not
 
02:56:20.229 --> 02:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
receive any any bids uh my second
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
question was on a time frame that would
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
be expended in Sinking the owner or said
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
property and the answer was over the
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
required 90 to 180 days and often times
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
longer uh the attempt in locating the
 
02:56:34.510 --> 02:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
property owner were more often difficult
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
because of the transientness of this
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
population also of not of value they
 
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
were not interested in recovering the
 
02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:42.269 align:start position:0%
were not interested in recovering the
abandoned

02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
abandoned
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
property as a as a Manchester Alderman I
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
recall discussions on leasing space for
 
02:56:49.950 --> 02:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
the expansion of evidence and and adding
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
evidence technicians to the department
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
compliment of course they both came at
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
an added cost after reading Lieutenant
 
02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
Lou testimony related to
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
20192020 uh the processing of over
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
29,000 articles with thousands of items
 
02:57:06.990 --> 02:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
fit in the description of this bill I
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
clearly saw a justification uh in
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
bringing House Bill 375 forward for your
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%

03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:43.160 align:start position:0%

03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
that uh my name is uh Joe H I live in
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
gilmington and I've been before your
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee before this is the first time
 
03:04:43.229 --> 03:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
by by zoom and I just have a comment on
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
2 you can hear me
 
03:04:49.469 --> 03:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
okay we can hear you
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
fine okay uh the key word is
 
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
determined uh in the middle there if it
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
is determined in good faith by the uh
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
police department what I would my
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion is because of past experience
 
03:05:07.110 --> 03:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you in a minute is that the
 
03:05:09.630 --> 03:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
determination should be made by another
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
body of the town I think sort of like
 
03:05:13.630 --> 03:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
the board of selectman because let me
 
03:05:14.590 --> 03:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
give you an
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
example is I was involved in a court
 
03:05:19.389 --> 03:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
case once and my stun gun was never
 
03:05:22.510 --> 03:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
returned by the police chief this was
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
town of Ashlin Ernie parette I never got
 
03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
town of Ashlin Ernie parette I never got
it

03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
back and uh it it would have been nice
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
if it was gone over to the board of
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
selectman then they would have notified
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
me saying well the police chief I guess
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
he uh pocketed it or gave it to somebody
 
03:05:39.790 --> 03:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
else I don't know I never got to the
 
03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line but I just thought it would
 
03:05:44.349 --> 03:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
be a like a checking balance that's all
 
03:05:46.750 --> 03:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
I have to
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
say unless you have a
 
03:05:52.269 --> 03:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
question determination deter
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
determination should be done by third
 
03:05:58.229 --> 03:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%

03:31:53.550 --> 03:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
moment sorry represent representative I
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you I think my
 
03:31:56.590 --> 03:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is it has to be a positive
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
motion first and then you can offer the
 
03:31:59.279 --> 03:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
motion first and then you can offer the
the

03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr unless I'm mistaken I have
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
we did an executive session on
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
498 we did we did an ex an exe we so we
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
there was a motion made by
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative John BT uh representative
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
BT and then that that motion of the pass
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
was withdrawn so we did a roll call to
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
withdraw to withdraw the motion every
 
03:32:27.950 --> 03:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
vote because we're doing this uh hybrid
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
style digitally one of the requirements
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
is that every vote is done by roll call
 
03:32:33.279 --> 03:32:34.790 align:start position:0%
is that every vote is done by roll call

so so we'll do another I will the same
 
03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%

d02
55h

03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
you may speak to that
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you um this amendment
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
will hopefully uh draw to a a conclusion
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh a kind of an ongoing uh controversy
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
and issue uh that we've been attempting
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
to try to resolve as a committee and A
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislature for uh for about the last
 
03:33:37.150 --> 03:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
three years now uh representative
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
Alexander and I were on a study
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee that actually looked into the
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
payment of bail Commissioners training
 
03:33:45.550 --> 03:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
issues identification issues a whole
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of issues but one of the things
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
that really I think jumped out at
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
everybody was the fact that the way that
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
our system is set up now Bill
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are the the only people uh
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
who work for the state and who work for
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
the court system who actually do their
 
03:34:02.469 --> 03:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
job and aren't guaranteed to be
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
compensated for it um so what
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
essentially uh we we've done with the
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think we we all heard the
 
03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
concerns of Judge King uh judge king
 
03:34:18.030 --> 03:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
last week and one of his uh biggest
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
concerns was um uh the fact that he
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
seemed to want the uh the legislature to
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
Define indig indigency for the purpose
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioner's fee um one of
 
03:34:34.469 --> 03:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
the things that representative Alexander
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
reminded me of offline is that uh HB uh
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
1645 which was the the Omnibus criminal
 
03:34:44.830 --> 03:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
justice bill that was passed last year
 
03:34:47.070 --> 03:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
um actually requires the court system to
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
do that so the the court system was uh
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
was and I'll essentially read you the
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
line uh out of the
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
RSA uh but the the line out of the RSA
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
says the court shall develop uniform
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
criteria to evaluate and determine
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
whether an offended uh whether an
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
offender is Indigent or not Indigent for
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the offender's ability to
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
pay the bill Commissioners fee based on
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
the criteria the court shall render a
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
finding of indigent or not Indigent for
 
03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the offender's ability to
 
03:35:23.870 --> 03:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
pay the bail commissioner's fee so in in
 
03:35:27.630 --> 03:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
in other words we left it up to uh the
 
03:35:29.910 --> 03:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Court to figure out how
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to handle this and uh it
 
03:35:34.830 --> 03:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
became apparent or it's become apparent
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
that they haven't quite figured that out
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
yet um I think representative Alexander
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I both agreed
 
03:35:42.910 --> 03:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
that this is something that they they
 
03:35:45.389 --> 03:35:45.399 align:start position:0%
need to figure out so what the amendment
 
03:35:48.429 --> 03:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
does is it it essentially inserts a
 
03:35:51.630 --> 03:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
reminder uh and a reference uh to the to
 
03:35:51.640 --> 03:35:52.309 align:start position:0%
reminder uh and a reference uh to the to
the

03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
RSA um and it uh it essentially does not
 
03:35:59.309 --> 03:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
change the requirement in the in the
 
03:36:01.870 --> 03:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
bill at any way that the court system
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
pay the the bail commissioner fee um and
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
what it also does is it does remove some
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the other things that were concerned
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
to judge King uh so he was concerned
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the ad about appointing 10
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
different uh County commissions uh to uh
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
to you know to to recruit and approve um
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
new bail Commissioners uh and he was
 
03:36:30.110 --> 03:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
also uh uh concerned about um the
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
transfer of
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh from the administ uh
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
from the administrative Court of the
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to the uh to the Superior
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
Court uh for bail commissioners so we've
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
removed that and so essentially what you
 
03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
have in front of you in this amendment
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
is what is the entire bill now and what
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
I would say is that this bill really
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
sort of does address the concerns of the
 
03:36:55.630 --> 03:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners that have been coming
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
to us uh year after year after year
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
trying to have uh trying to get our help
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to to basically make sure they get
 
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
paid this this amendment uh will make
 
03:37:11.229 --> 03:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
sure that they get paid um and and uh
 
03:37:13.189 --> 03:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
and it will allow the rest of the court
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
system or the the the rest of this the
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
bail commission system to essentially uh
 
03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
proceed uh the the way that it
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
is so that that in a nutshell is uh is
 
03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.070 --> 03:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
to thank you representative M I believe
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander is in the
 
03:37:36.429 --> 03:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
process of I just emailed it it should
 
03:37:38.590 --> 03:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
be avilable forwarding the committee a
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment that you were just
 
03:37:40.439 --> 03:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment that you were just
speaking

03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
to I'll just give
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
everyone minute to just kind of look
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
it representative Muse I may ask a
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
03:38:04.349 --> 03:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I know one of the concerns
 
03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
judge came raised was that there was a
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
perceived conflict between having a
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
panel where you would have the county
 
03:38:16.750 --> 03:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
attorney and involv in
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
the appointing of a bail commissioner
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment fix that problem correct
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
well what this what this amendment does
 
03:38:25.189 --> 03:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
is it essentially leaves the current
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
system in place um so uh rather than
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
having a separate commission Bill
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would continue to to be
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
appointed by the court I I think one of
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard from Judge King
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
was that you know they haven't had much
 
03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
of an issue attracting new bail
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners lately it's it's not
 
03:38:45.030 --> 03:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily a problem that needs fixing
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
and we also heard from several of the
 
03:38:48.710 --> 03:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners themselves that you
 
03:38:50.510 --> 03:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
know if there if there are any issues
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
with a bail commissioner they're they're
 
03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much taken care of by the court
 
03:38:57.389 --> 03:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
and and so the the current way that
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
things are set up ensures accountability
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
for the bail Commissioners uh and I
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
think what we're trying to do in passing
 
03:39:07.630 --> 03:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment is just to make sure that
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
that you know that the bill Commission
 
03:39:12.670 --> 03:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
actually uh could get paid for the
 
03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
render does anyone else wish to speak on
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
or participate in discussion on the
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
do I haven't seen the
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't know what it
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:42.389 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't know what it
does

03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
I can add that it it gets rid of all of
 
03:39:50.990 --> 03:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
the commissions and oversight groups and
 
03:39:52.870 --> 03:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
everything like that just deletes all
 
03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
those and all it's left is the first
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
part first paragraph that and it in that
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
first paragraph it then says by the way
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
do your job and Define the uh what inent
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
means is that
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
right maybe not exactly the way I would
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
have said it but but I think that's I
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
think that's the gist of it
 
03:40:19.150 --> 03:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
y represent that that's in a nutshell
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
just like what represent Des providers
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that what is important with
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
that was that the there was a perceived
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest even though it
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't per se conflict having the County
 
03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved in the appointment
 
03:40:35.469 --> 03:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
they thought that they should there was
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
something about that that the church
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
King just didn't think gave a good
 
03:40:41.229 --> 03:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
perception of public this solve that
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a concern that I didn't
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
think of Judge brought that up it's good
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
point but it fixes that what does this
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal um issue here the so the one of
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
the things that was a little bit hard to
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
determine in the testimony was exactly
 
03:41:03.309 --> 03:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
what the criteria were to create the
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um and one of the things if
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
you if you if you basically look at it
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like the assumption is about
 
03:41:14.389 --> 03:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
50% of the cases will be declared
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
Indigent there are elements in the bill
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry in the RSA that this sits on
 
03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
top of that actually delineate processes
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
for the court um you know to to to
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
basically go uh I don't want to say
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
above and beyond but to ensure that you
 
03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
know a a a good faith attempt is made at
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
first you know just simply to collect
 
03:41:38.830 --> 03:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
the fee uh so job one is if the fee if
 
03:41:40.830 --> 03:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
the fee is collectible if the the person
 
03:41:43.389 --> 03:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
is not Indigent let's go ahead and uh
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
and and collect the fee and and I think
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is he was talk
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
judge king was talking to us about what
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
he would like to see us do is is I think
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
he was kind of advocating for a system
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
that just wouldn't that wouldn't uh
 
03:42:00.269 --> 03:42:00.279 align:start position:0%
simply allow anybody to just sort of
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
stick their hand up and say I'm Indigent
 
03:42:06.030 --> 03:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
and be and not be able to pay the fee um
 
03:42:08.429 --> 03:42:08.439 align:start position:0%
so if you if
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
you if you take into account that no
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
people in our state government have more
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
experience with bail Commissioners and
 
03:42:17.550 --> 03:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
how the system should work than the
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
administrative court if anybody should
 
03:42:22.149 --> 03:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out how to make that
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
fee or or or how to to minimize the
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
amount of uh of money that's actually
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
paid out uh and and how to put some good
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
qualifications around what constitutes
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
indigency for the purpose of a bail
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fee which is different
 
03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
from from Council um then I think it's
 
03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that the administrative
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
Court should be able to do so I think
 
03:42:50.110 --> 03:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I think my my take on the
 
03:42:55.189 --> 03:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um is um uh it likely
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
overestimates what um the actual cost
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be to the state uh assuming that
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
the administrative Court uh puts
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
together um some workable processes to
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
ensure collection of the
 
03:43:08.880 --> 03:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
ensure collection of the
fee

03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative TR thank you Mr chair um
 
03:43:19.469 --> 03:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
I've heard it said that the
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
basically the uh the amendment becomes
 
03:43:25.469 --> 03:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.030 --> 03:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
now I have enough
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty reading a bill and trying to
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
comprehend it when it's in front of
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
me I'm incapable of reading an amendment
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:46.990 --> 03:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
I just think perhaps we we used 15
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
minutes and I I I haven't gone anywhere
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
in that 15 minutes I haven't been able
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.070 --> 03:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill U representative true
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh we will not we will not vote on a
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill that you didn't have an opportunity
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%

03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
I what I'll do for now let me we can
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%

03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
itl HB
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
365 which gives peace officers status of
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement
 
03:45:54.429 --> 03:45:54.439 align:start position:0%

chairman I second the motion of
 
03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:02.189 align:start position:0%
chairman I second the motion of
uh

03:46:02.189 --> 03:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
represent thank
 
03:46:06.910 --> 03:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
you represent T do you wish to speak on
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
your motion just just shortly just a
 
03:46:14.229 --> 03:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
little bit uh I just have difficulty
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
with more and more Federal involvement
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
at the state level and I know that there
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
are cases drug cases weapons cases and
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
so on where that appears to be
 
03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh and you know I I
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
sympathize with people who think it is
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
but I really have difficulty with
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
federal agents coming into the state to
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
enforce laws of any
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:44.309 align:start position:0%
enforce laws of any
kind

03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper yeah U thank you
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I support the itl motion
 
03:46:52.510 --> 03:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting it was one of the people
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
testifying the officer uh referred to it
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
as the uh federal police force that's
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty dangerous term and I I I
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
agree with representative teser and
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
we're getting way too much
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
um Federal Inus into our state so I'm
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
going to support the IDE
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
03:47:19.630 --> 03:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl motion I think that this
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill makes sense um there are ready
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement and involved in
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh task force uh there are occasional as
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
noted in the initial testimony uh FBI
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
agent that uh witness a crime this bill
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
basically allows the uh federal agent if
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
certified and trained in New Hampshire
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
law to arrest and immediately take that
 
03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
person to State Police
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's overstepping uh
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
the federal overstepping their uh their
 
03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
job um
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that if uh a federal agent
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
was involved in a task force arrest and
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
they were not uh uh permitted by law to
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh do that arrest they could be
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
subject to uh liability uh issues so I'm
 
03:48:34.189 --> 03:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to uh protest this motion of
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Marston thank you Mr
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I too will consider the igl
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
what I see here from Newman was a five
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
to support 28 to oppose and I've had
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
nothing but a flurry of people emailing

toote to affirm it
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
repr green thank you Mr chair I also
 
03:49:16.149 --> 03:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
have had a lot of constit constituents
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh contact me saying it was bad and
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
during the break I spoke with a lot of
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers are against it
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
because it's uh it's against that
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
Newman I'm going to oppose the uh um itl
 
03:49:37.870 --> 03:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill and I think that's because
 
03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
as it originally drafted I had concerns
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
about any federal law enforcement
 
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
officer could just Pony up and and
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
request for this um the waiver I guess
 
03:49:51.630 --> 03:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
or or the what the result of the bill
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
being able to arrest and it turns out
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
that I think from the
 
03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
testimony it shows that the uh person
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
that testified I forget his name but
 
03:50:05.710 --> 03:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
said that um when they had their task
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
forces this this was a benefit to them
 
03:50:12.030 --> 03:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the the cases where they were on an
 
03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
activity and they had a federal law
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
lauring officer who was part of that but
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
did not not have the power to arrest and
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this would help that so for that
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
03:50:34.750 --> 03:50:34.760 align:start position:0%

in favor of pass reasons that I asked
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
two questions and the only answer I was
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
receiving is I don't know I hadn't
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
reached out um I don't see where uh
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
there there's anybody else other
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
than witness referred to as the special
 
03:50:54.990 --> 03:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
AG the FBI nobody from other agencies
 
03:50:58.830 --> 03:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
such the treasury Secret Service ATF or
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
da uh have reached
 
03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
out pushing for this be
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
Knight thank you uh chairman uh thank
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
you colleagues I'm gonna support the
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
itale motion at this time when I asked
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh the chief how many times during his
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
career or his in his experience
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
specifically had the lack of this law
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
impeded his ability to carry carry out
 
03:51:43.149 --> 03:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
or perform his duty and he said n none
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
of those times so at this point I think
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we need more documentation we need
 
03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
more evidence to support why we would
 
03:51:55.149 --> 03:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
need to address this and I don't feel
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
that that was adequately represented
 
03:51:57.600 --> 03:52:02.950 align:start position:0%
that that was adequately represented
thank

03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
bden thank you Mr CH I was impacted by
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony about um the interaction
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
between um Federal officers and
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
protesters in Seattle and I'm concerned
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
about um some of the issues surrounding
 
03:52:26.349 --> 03:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
the differences in in law at the state
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
level in New Hampshire versus Federal
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
level are things that are uh as I
 
03:52:34.389 --> 03:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
understand it legal at the state level
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
that are illegal at the federal level
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
and I think for that reason I'm going to
 
03:52:38.239 --> 03:52:45.070 align:start position:0%
and I think for that reason I'm going to
support

03:52:45.070 --> 03:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
I I will say just one thing that jumped
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
out to me I have a hard time believing
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
that any federal agent would watch a a
 
03:52:53.790 --> 03:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
felony or someone who's injured and just
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
sit there and do nothing because they're
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
afraid of civil liability I I think
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
First Responders in
 
03:53:03.870 --> 03:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
general uh that's just not how how I've
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
never heard of a first respond that
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
would sit there and just watch something
 
03:53:10.030 --> 03:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
like that go happen they they sit idle
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
and do
 
03:53:10.960 --> 03:53:12.830 align:start position:0%
and do
nothing

03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:53:16.149 --> 03:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh it seems like that that wouldn't be
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
something that if they did have wouldn't
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
happen very
 
03:53:22.030 --> 03:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
frequently so in as representative
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
Knight said no witness could tell us an
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
example with that happen other than one
 
03:53:27.680 --> 03:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
example with that happen other than one
hypothetical

03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%

04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
of any in speeding to legislate yes Mr
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um basically all the
 
04:06:11.309 --> 04:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
testimon that I heard during that um on
 
04:06:11.319 --> 04:06:12.510 align:start position:0%
testimon that I heard during that um on
that

04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
bill the testimony of evidence for its
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
necessity seem to be out of state even I
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
I believe a representative Schmidt who
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
was testifying for her bill in nashwa
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
said the the police in Nash are pretty U
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
measured as to using um
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
non-lethal um
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
ammunition in their community and that
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
they're well trained I think we got the
 
04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
same testimony for
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester so it seems like it is not an
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
issue in the state of New Hampshire so
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh for that and other reasons I I think
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Maron thank
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman does Mr Newman have a
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
did he have one PR or does he have a
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
understand uh I believe you're referring
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
to representative Muse and it correct me
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong are you asking about the
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers on who is in support
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
of H
 
04:07:29.309 --> 04:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
hb564 the
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
public yes the public okay the public
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
support numbers and the public oppos
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
numbers that is that what you're asking
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah representative n do you have that
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
that information available to you I do
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
we had 220 people sign in in favor of
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
opposition representative Testament I'll
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
be somewhat redundant to the testimony
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
we heard but it's just ludicrous to me
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
that the person who's barricaded in a
 
04:08:08.830 --> 04:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
house U possibly
 
04:08:11.469 --> 04:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
firearms and we wouldn't let them try
 
04:08:14.830 --> 04:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
tear gas to drive them out of that house
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
yet we'd let them
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
use uh firearms and you I don't think
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
the people who are opposed to this uh
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
are thinking that because the only
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
option left to police if this goes
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
through is to use a 9 mimer a 40 cal or
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
you know 223 that's a whole lot worse
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
gas representative GA I am against the
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
itl of the bill and if you recall um
 
04:08:54.990 --> 04:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment done on this bill
 
04:08:58.870 --> 04:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
and this um talk to demonstrators that
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
were um their right to demonstrate and
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
they were peaceful demonstrators as well
 
04:09:08.030 --> 04:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
so there was more to them
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
Bill don't
 
04:09:25.800 --> 04:09:27.710 align:start position:0%
Bill don't
know

04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent thank youate represent G
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
reminding the committee of the amendment
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill before you clear has
 
04:09:39.630 --> 04:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
problems I think even the sponsor
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
acknowled that testimony the amendment
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
is a good effort to address those
 
04:09:47.550 --> 04:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
problems and to to recognize what
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
represented test has said there are
 
04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
situations when these non-lethal weapons
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
um are are perfectly appropriate and
 
04:09:57.870 --> 04:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
lead to better outcomes uh there are
 
04:10:01.870 --> 04:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
times when um maybe they should not be
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
used and this bill provides some guard
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
rails uh around their use that do not
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
currently exist and it's although you
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
know things may or may not be problems
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
quotequote now in our state this would
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
provide some um some I guess regulation
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
moving forward which is always helpful
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:39.469 align:start position:0%
 
fail

04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
um even
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire there's been U
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
several demonstrations and their
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrations with children and the
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
parents and they're peaceful
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrations and so we just want to
 
04:10:58.269 --> 04:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that if the if they're using
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
something that is not something that's
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
directly at a person that's not causing
 
04:11:02.439 --> 04:11:03.309 align:start position:0%
directly at a person that's not causing
any

04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
harm and that's a serious
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
issue so to say you want to kill a bill
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
that really protects the
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
that call can what is the amendment
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
number uh mrman if I
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
could it and your question just just
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
04:11:33.309 --> 04:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
hand representative
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
Marson I do have a statement but I have
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
a point of order first
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
I believe the ranking memb spoke once
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
and then spoke a second time before
 
04:11:43.439 --> 04:11:44.950 align:start position:0%
and then spoke a second time before
everybody

04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:11:44.960 --> 04:11:47.189 align:start position:0%
everybody
else

04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
so it is at discretion of the chair I it
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
is I will say the Mason's man does
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you do call on a member
 
04:11:59.149 --> 04:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
to speak for a second time during a
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
discussion you should only do that after
 
04:12:03.870 --> 04:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
all the members who wish to speak for
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
the first time if I made that mistake
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
represent Marson I I
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
as you know I did not interrupt let me
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
State what I wanted to State about this
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill I find the bill is all too
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
overreaching to begin with officers do
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
not carry or have regularly been issued
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
either rubber bullets or tear gas in
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
their arsenal when they go out on the
 
04:12:32.520 --> 04:12:34.070 align:start position:0%
their arsenal when they go out on the
your

04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:12:38.149 --> 04:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
controls those are issued only when when
 
04:12:40.670 --> 04:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
the Departments and the Chiefs find it
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
necessary because of facing a large
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
crowd or a riot and the use of tear gas
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
is a crowd control measure to help
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
disperse them would that being all
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
said I wait to hear about the Amendments
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
it representative Balden thank you Mr
 
04:13:06.239 --> 04:13:08.149 align:start position:0%
it representative Balden thank you Mr
chairman

04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
um there are many non legal options
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
available to remain if we eliminated gas
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
and rubber bullets an example is um the
 
04:13:24.429 --> 04:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
this is um a machine that makes an
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly loud noise uh the man police
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually had it um set up and ready when
 
04:13:32.790 --> 04:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
there were some protests over the summer
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
that kind of drag their way down on the
 
04:13:37.510 --> 04:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
south Bow Street from uh I think stre
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
where the protest is there was a group
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
of people there agitating they were
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
yelling at police they were live
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
streaming themselves really enjoying um
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Limelight I think for a little bit
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
and Manchester police have their l r set
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
up and we're prepared to use it if
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
necessary and this is something that
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
would have made an extremely lar sound
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that would um be aible from my house
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
miles away uh and the whole purpose is
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
to use nonlethal efforts um to disect
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
out and encourage people to go back to
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
their homes day instead of
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
agitating um so there are options that
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
remain even if we eliminate tear gas and
 
04:14:21.870 --> 04:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets which are perceived maybe
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
in error to be nonlethal because they AR
 
04:14:23.920 --> 04:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
in error to be nonlethal because they AR
always

04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:14:27.550 --> 04:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
nonlethal additionally I think it's
 
04:14:29.710 --> 04:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
worth noting that there may be many
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
things that don't happen very often in a
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire that we still
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
oppose and seek to eliminate from
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
society um examples could be kidnapping
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
murder carjacking TR Invasion these are
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly rare in our state but we have
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
laws against them
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
nonetheless so whether or not there is a
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
common use of death or rubber bullets in
 
04:14:58.349 --> 04:14:58.359 align:start position:0%
our state to dat isn't really relevant
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the moral issue of whether police
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
should be using uh tools like this on
 
04:15:07.389 --> 04:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
people who might be um encouraged to
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
with something something
 
04:15:09.520 --> 04:15:11.149 align:start position:0%
with something something
like

04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and again I'm interested in opposing
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
the motion because I'd like to see this
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and give some consideration
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
you represent did you find the amendment
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
I did thank you I'm not going to speak
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
amendment we have that opportunity but
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment was sent to the committee
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
multiple times by accident on Friday um
 
04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
0229 and if the committee would like I
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
can send it again your
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
wa I would just recommend sending it to
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
do Casey sent it out on February 5th at
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
10:14 a.m. and then C sent it out on
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.389 --> 04:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
p.m. there was there was two amendments
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually out there that's that's why we
 
04:16:25.590 --> 04:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
having make sure talking same I think Ma
 
04:16:25.600 --> 04:16:26.990 align:start position:0%
having make sure talking same I think Ma
representative

04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
abson had an amendment out there too so
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just making sure we're all talking s
 
04:16:32.399 --> 04:16:34.429 align:start position:0%
I'm just making sure we're all talking s
that's

04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
why represented true
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair with all due
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
respect I am not trying to gum up the
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
works in any way but we had an itl
 
04:16:50.670 --> 04:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor and then we start
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
talking about an amendment that has not
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
been introduced that's not on the floor
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
that I have no idea what we're talking
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
about and if somebody says well I send
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
it to you
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative I'm swamped in my
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
computer I get hundreds of emails a
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
day if amendments are going to be
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
introduced I would like them physically
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be here so everyone has equal
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read the
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't have a I have no
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
problem with that statement right now
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's no amendment being offered the
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
amendment can only be offered on a
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
positive motion I believe the reference
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
to the amendment by the two members of
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the committee they were using they're
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
referencing as a point of advocacy in
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the itl which I I I would say that's a
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
fair point of discussion without arguing
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself because I think
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
what the argument is is that the
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it supports their ARG in
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
opposition the we have a motion on the
 
04:17:59.229 --> 04:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
FL we have to act on yes yes we have to
 
04:18:01.710 --> 04:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
act on the itl motion first which I'm
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
not going to I wouldn't beem that out of
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
work I understand the
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:08.189 align:start position:0%
work I understand the
frustration

04:18:08.189 --> 04:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
just in regards
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
to excuse me represent Holden I'm gonna
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
call on uh representative Muse first
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
Muse M you got unmute yourself Sor that
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
my issue with this particular building
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
less about the the Banning of rubber
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
bullets and uh
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
tear gas itself and it's it's more about
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
their utilization so so one of the
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
things that I like about the amendment
 
04:18:47.469 --> 04:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
that was offered um is that it really
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
would um draw some pretty tight
 
04:18:52.429 --> 04:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
guidelines around shooting these things
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
into crowds and I think that's really
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue um it's the
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
indiscriminative firing or use of these
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
weapons uh in in protests and I do I I
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
do believe that the uh that the we
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get any testimony from the police
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
standards and training folks but I do
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
think that there are some some uh
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
administrative guidelines and uh and
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
some training that goes around
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
utilization of these weapons but I think
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
as we've seen Time After Time across the
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
country um these weapons uh are if they
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
if people are outfitted with them uh if
 
04:19:29.710 --> 04:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
officers are outfitted with them in the
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
con in conjunction with a protest maybe
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
just because they're not used that often
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh and because they are build As
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
non-lethal Weapons it's a little bit
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
easier to think gee well what's going to
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
happen if I just fire this thing into a
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
crowd um the testimony that we got from
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
The Trial New Hampshire trial ERS
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
Association had some pretty graphic
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
pictures of injuries that people have
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
suffered as a result of these um so you
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
know to me I think that there are way
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
there's a way that we can actually
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
improve um or you know increase the
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
public safety of people who are
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
exercising their first amendment rights
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
while not necessarily removing these uh
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
from uh you know the the Arsenal police
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
to useing things like situations where
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
um you know people are holed up in a in
 
04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
a in a in a ho in a um in a building or
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
an apartment they're not going to come
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
out um they're shooting at officers or
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
whatever I you know I I don't
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that we have to to um
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have to look at this as as
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
purely a black and white issue and and
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
again this is one of the reasons why uh
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes I wish we had a little bit
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
more time with these things because I I
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
do think that with this particular one
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
there would be a way to fix it that
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
would make it amenable to the most of us
 
04:20:56.720 --> 04:21:05.429 align:start position:0%
would make it amenable to the most of us
I

04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
hope

04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
hope
 
04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
pakis yes Mr chairman could we is there
 
04:21:16.109 --> 04:21:16.119 align:start position:0%
any way that we could
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
have uh legislative service email leads
 
04:21:25.229 --> 04:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendments representative panelas U do
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
you mind repeating your statement I I
 
04:21:36.119 --> 04:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
you mind repeating your statement I I
apologize

04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
guys is there any way that we could ask
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislative service to send these
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
amendments directly to our emails so we
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
would have
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
them what I what I would say going
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
forward if anyone in this committee puts
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know has an amendment they should
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
take it upon themselves to make sure it
 
04:21:57.760 --> 04:21:58.429 align:start position:0%
take it upon themselves to make sure it
gets

04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
forwarded I know I represent probably
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
might have done that twice anyway but I
 
04:22:05.790 --> 04:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
would still do that uh just to make sure
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
it gets done
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
and if if the other thing I would
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
recommend is if you want that amendment
 
04:22:16.349 --> 04:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
to be everyone have a print out you
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
contact the committee assistant to do
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
that I that's that part of that falls on
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
my responsibility
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
but for the people remotely I you're
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.109 --> 04:22:36.119 align:start position:0%
email representative Nas a followup to
 
04:22:36.119 --> 04:22:37.189 align:start position:0%
email representative Nas a followup to
that

04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh I what you were saying is if I wanted
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
to put an amendment out that it would be
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
my responsibility to tell them to send
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
it to the other
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
members I was recommending that the
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
member just forward it as a matter of
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
practice just to do it there's no harm
 
04:22:59.229 --> 04:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
in that uh for us to do that it's not
 
04:23:01.710 --> 04:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a a rule that you one must
 
04:23:04.109 --> 04:23:04.119 align:start position:0%
follow but it certainly seemed like a
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.119 --> 04:23:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative yes sure um as you know
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
and I think my ranking member knows that
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh I've stayed long with like but I have
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
head to work so like would have liked to
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
continue on with this uh conversation
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
leave we are not in the voting mode so
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
there there's no obligation
 
04:23:38.279 --> 04:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
there there's no obligation
that

04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.030 --> 04:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
voting marking about amendments we got a
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
motion of an it we should fall motion
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
fails and we deal with the
 
04:23:58.990 --> 04:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I haven't seen any amendments
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
yet since I've been on this
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
commit somebody bring it
 
04:24:12.930 --> 04:24:12.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.940 --> 04:24:16.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.710 --> 04:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.720 --> 04:24:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:24:22.510 --> 04:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
you you recognize thank you Mr chairman
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask us to uh vote down the
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
it motion so we can hear and the uh the
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that's been brought forward
 
04:24:40.269 --> 04:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh I cannot support the bill as written
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
today but I think that the amendment
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
does make it a uh a bill that I can
 
04:24:52.349 --> 04:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
support um so I'm going to ask us to uh
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
vote down itl motion if we adopt the
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh we'll try another motion
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
but if we don't adopt the motion then uh
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
itl

04:25:08.590 --> 04:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
you recognize from point of
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
order if we vote down the
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
itl before you can take the amendment up
 
04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
you must vote the bill
 
04:25:22.830 --> 04:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
up it means my understanding is there
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be a positive motion on the
 
04:25:28.590 --> 04:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
floor in order to offer the amendment so
 
04:25:30.670 --> 04:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty far from that at this
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
point in time but
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:25:36.910 align:start position:0%
correct representative

chairman um I know we're in kind of an
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
unusual situation about these amendments
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult I realize there is a
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor to itl I also
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
realize that the majority uh can
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
probably pass that with the uh today
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now and I I just think that uh
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
based on a conversation that I had with
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
a member who is an expert on this kind
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
of stuff this
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
weekend um we if this motion is passed
 
04:26:10.590 --> 04:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
itl it will go
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
forward um if it and then it would not
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
be able to be considered for two years
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
if this is an amendment that uh the
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee thinks could
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
be improved to the point where it might
 
04:26:25.109 --> 04:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
protect the citizens uh with the
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
safeguards involved whatever may be in
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
that Amendment then this this rule May
 
04:26:34.750 --> 04:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
if it is voted down could have a
 
04:26:38.429 --> 04:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
positive vote I believe it's a positive
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
um um uh motion to retain if in fact the
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee felt that they could do some
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
work on it this year rather than um uh
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that we could not vote on
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
this or another thing like this for two
 
04:26:58.750 --> 04:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
years so I I hope that's a correct
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
understanding and that's all I have to
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
offer as far as this
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
goes what I'll say just before we we
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
move this this motion uh put this motion
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
forward for a vote I understand what the
 
04:27:14.429 --> 04:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
the intent of the amendment is but that
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
conduct addressed in the amendment in my
 
04:27:20.070 --> 04:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
opinion is already would be considered
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
excessive force if you look the RSA
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
6275 discusses the use of non-deadly
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
force and if there's a peaceful protest
 
04:27:33.149 --> 04:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
or a peaceful group of people crowded
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
together and the police officer decides
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
to fire a a rubber bullets into that
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
crowd of people without any Rhyme or
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
Reason on who they're aiming at I would
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
find that to be excessive force some of
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
the current law and I'm I don't
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
know um I'm not sure the amendment is
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
creating any new law because that would
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
already be excessive for us that is the
 
04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm going to support in
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
support of the motion of it I I would
 
04:28:02.670 --> 04:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
think if a police officer did do that
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
that that would be very inappropriate
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
behavior I believe that they would
 
04:28:07.710 --> 04:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
probably be liable under the federal
 
04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
civil rights statute you can even make a
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
strong argument that they could be
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
criminally prosecuted that is that is
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
very inappropriate use of force for any
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
police officer to do that and I I would
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
presume that that uh I would hope the
 
04:28:21.630 --> 04:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at least investigate
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
that in consider of pross it it ever
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
happen because it's clearly what I would
 
04:28:29.149 --> 04:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
look at is not acceptable use of force
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
under the current the amendment
 
04:28:33.750 --> 04:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
articulates it again but I think it's
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
we're not we're going to have we're
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
we're running up against the clock so I
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the last two members I
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative B made the uh represent
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
ho you made the motion but I'll I'll
 
04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
recognize repr first let you close it
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
out I just wanted to mention I don't
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
know if it was obvious to everyone in
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
the committee that umly emailed out the
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment again within the last minutes
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
and I assume everyone else in the room
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
getting there a lot of emails right now
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
about other bills hundred of emails but
 
04:29:17.550 --> 04:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
if your the time stamp in my inbox is
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
you representative popper thank you Mr
 
04:29:37.950 --> 04:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
Conley for the amendment I did read it
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
and it still Falls really short it's
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
still basically those people haven't
 
04:29:48.910 --> 04:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
read it unless a
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding says that an officer
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
cannot use rubber bullets and um tear
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
gas unless he feels he is in direct uh
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
chance of being uh physically armed
 
04:30:03.149 --> 04:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
which would mean he couldn't use it to
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
protect members of the public so I
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
really think this is a training issue
 
04:30:10.349 --> 04:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
this isn't I don't think we should uh
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
pass it bill today one way or the other
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
because I think it's a function of
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
making sure officers who dispense that
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
type of ammunition are well trained and
 
04:30:22.830 --> 04:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
so far all the evidence we' had in
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
our I'll stick with my IDE the last
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative has not spoken yet so I'm
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
recognize represent wel unless the
 
04:30:45.109 --> 04:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
discussion lot important person
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
professionals and when they they don't
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
carry Rubble bullets and tear gas with
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
them on their
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
cruises the only time that these things
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
are ever even considered is in certain
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
instances usually have a squat team show
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
up or something of
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
that and if we don't trust our police
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
officers to make the right decisions why
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
should we make decisions farther we not
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're not trained on that
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%

04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
welcome those you don't know
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative Roy was a member of this
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
year thank you uh Mr chairman uh Mr
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh members of the committee
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for he my testimony my name is
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I am representative
 
04:35:11.470 --> 04:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham 32 representing the
 
04:35:14.109 --> 04:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
towns of candy at Deerfield Nottingham
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
in Northwood I'm here to introduce HB
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
471 to you
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
today this bill would
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
make disciplinary hearings for police
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
officers for their certification at the
 
04:35:31.470 --> 04:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
state level open to the
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
public as some of you may recall I was
 
04:35:36.429 --> 04:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
here last week and I advocated that we
 
04:35:39.869 --> 04:35:39.879 align:start position:0%
not get involved in making decisions for
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
the police as far as their ability to
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
make calls regarding the use of
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
force and as such that grants them great
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
Authority police officers in our society
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
enjoy an extreme amount of power and
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
authority that we invest in
 
04:36:00.670 --> 04:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
them and I believe that with great power
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
comes great
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility as we've seen across the
 
04:36:07.629 --> 04:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
country country there's a great call for
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
policing and I believe that this bill
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
would be a good start towards that in
 
04:36:13.680 --> 04:36:14.510 align:start position:0%
would be a good start towards that in
New

04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now this does not mean that
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
their employment hearings are public
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
their hearings between themselves and
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
their employers would still be a matter
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
of personnel matter but this is their
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
certification to be able to police
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
officer anywhere in the state of New
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's my belief that if you are
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
in front of that board
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's a question whether or not you
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
are qualified to remain a police officer
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I believe that due to the power
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
police officers hold in our
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
society transparency is important and
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
the public has a right to know what the
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
allegations against them are and whether
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
or not they are clear to those
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.029 --> 04:36:58.039 align:start position:0%
founded keeping these matters
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
transparent only creates and
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
fosters an atmosphere of distrust
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
against the people that we rely on most
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
and have trust in the word of a police
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
officer has relied upon to get search
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
warrants to make arrests and indeed as
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
we've heard to use Force sometimes
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
lethally and if we cannot have
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
transparency in those folks especially
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
in their ability to be a police officer
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
at the state
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
level it just creates more and more
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
distrust among the
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
citizenry so that is a HB 471 I'd be
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.830 --> 04:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
Knight chair and thank you
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
04:38:02.189 --> 04:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
question um in the interest of uh
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
protecting police officers as well
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
um could you give me an example of how
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
or when one would go about um saying
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
that they can seek confidentiality for
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
com what their compelling interests
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
might be just as for me as an
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
example sure I believe that would be
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
left up to the hearing officer and there
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
are there are certain instances in Juris
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
Prudence such as the names of children
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
if it involves
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a matter that would be um that would
 
04:38:41.230 --> 04:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
be considered more a Personnel matter
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
than a matter of public interest or
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
safety there's very few limited
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
circumstances in jurist Prudence where
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the public would not have access to it
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
in legislative intent it would be a
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
clear indication that the legislature
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
intends for it to be public so it would
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
be very limited
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
application I don't think it would be
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
possible for us to delineate all the
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
possible scenarios where privacy May
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
Trump public interest but there is as I
 
04:39:15.070 --> 04:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
already representative Balman and
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative if you don't mind raising
 
04:39:23.949 --> 04:39:23.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.959 --> 04:39:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay my question I just you could um
 
04:39:42.750 --> 04:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
um I I was a a municipal police officer
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
I was also an investigator for the state
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
um Board of Medicine and I was an
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
investigator for the Department of
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:07.948 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.190 --> 04:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative yes would like to ask a
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
question I thank you for your testimony
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and taking my question it I understand
 
04:40:18.270 --> 04:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
that and I I agree with the provision
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
about having issue of comp confidential
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
information do you have any opinion on
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
if if there was an amendment to add
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
privilege information to that as well
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm concerned within this me
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
just me being nitpicking but if someone
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
did have a f privilege
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
or if they chose not to wave it maybe
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that would also not be something
 
04:40:41.040 --> 04:40:45.030 align:start position:0%
that that would also not be something
that

04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
public I'm trying to um think about
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
currently with regard to employment
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
matters and Licensing matter if you have
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
a fifth amendment
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
privilege um I believe invoking that can
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
be can be used against you in a civil
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
matter that so that they can read into
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
that if they choose not to testify
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
because of an ongoing criminal
 
04:41:12.670 --> 04:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
investigation they are allowed to draw a
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
negative inference from that but if you
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
felt like they needed an amendment I
 
04:41:19.868 --> 04:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
would certainly support
 
04:41:24.190 --> 04:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
it and I'll just follow question I I
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
agree that it it does create negative
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
inference because it's civil hearing I
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
guess if someone were to challenge that
 
04:41:32.910 --> 04:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
the cl uh the person assarting the
 
04:41:36.750 --> 04:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
I I I suppose presented before the
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
hearing so that that's where I'm
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
wondering with that might not be
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
something that that's something I feel
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
should also be maybe done in closed
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
doors at discretion of
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
the that just I feel I feel what I'm
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
bringing up is the very not to come up
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
maybe again I be opposed to an amendment
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
like that or any Amendment so long as it
 
04:42:09.628 --> 04:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
didn't change the spirit of the bill
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
public representative
 
04:42:21.550 --> 04:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
pelas thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering if you can give
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
me an
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
example of a
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing that this would
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
relate to
 
04:42:38.670 --> 04:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative uh for
 
04:42:40.830 --> 04:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
example if a police officer were charged
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
with something of misconduct by his
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
department and the department referred
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
it to the um to the state for
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
decertification that hearing at the
 
04:42:53.830 --> 04:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
state level because a police officer in
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requires a certification
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
to be a police officer anywhere in the
 
04:42:59.550 --> 04:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
state so you could be disciplined by
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
your department and not be disciplined
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
by the state but if you referred to the
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
state so that you couldn't be police
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
officer anywhere that hearing would then
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
be open to the public based on this bill
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
whereas right now it's
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Knight excuse me
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative G
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
um Can Can you sort of describe what
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.868 --> 04:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
hearings to the best of my knowledge
 
04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
currently there's a hearing but it's not
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
open to the public and the findings of
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
the hearing are also not open to the
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
public as far as I know and I believe
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
that this relates somewhat to the Lor
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
list issue and I think someone will be
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
testifying after me that we'll be able
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
to explain it a little bit more in
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
depth follow follow question um do you
 
04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
know of any incidents recently
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
where there were serious issues where
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
someone probably was reprimanded but was
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
never and followed up with other stuff
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
more rep
 
04:44:22.510 --> 04:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
reprimand um no I don't and that's
 
04:44:24.990 --> 04:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
exactly my point that we don't
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:44:44.910 --> 04:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:44.920 --> 04:44:46.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:44:48.910 --> 04:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
green thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question would this involve
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
more time in uh setting up uh Committee
 
04:45:00.910 --> 04:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
involved in here in actions like this in
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
other words uh right now they probably
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
04:45:07.708 --> 04:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
closed they can say well we going to
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
have it in three days but we're talking
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
to the public is this going to extend
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
longer I I can't imagine it will
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I would think that
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's a significant amount of time
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
between the referral time and the actual
 
04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
hearing um it might take longer right
 
04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
now because they probably would have to
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
install some type of ability for the
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
public to see it while we're in this
 
04:45:29.948 --> 04:45:29.958 align:start position:0%
lockdown but generally speaking I I I
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
can't see why it would create any
 
04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
greater burden especially on time
 
04:45:46.830 --> 04:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Marson thank you Mr
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you for taking my question
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
do you know of any
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.040 --> 04:46:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
corporations

04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
businesses where when they discipline
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
one of their personnel they make it open
 
04:46:10.030 --> 04:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:46:12.990 --> 04:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
public uh Yes actually there uh several
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
other um other uh licensing boards the
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
for example the
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
um the board of bar overseers um when a
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
license for a lawyer is revoked that
 
04:46:28.628 --> 04:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
information is public um I believe
 
04:46:30.030 --> 04:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's several other professions as
 
04:46:33.548 --> 04:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
well that are licensed by the state um
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are public public information and
 
04:46:38.190 --> 04:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
again it's just the license not their
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's not their employment hearing
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
between them and their employer it's the
 
04:46:45.868 --> 04:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.878 --> 04:46:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
issue

04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
repres we're not talking about licensing
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
discipline um
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
technically no discipline would be by
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
your by your employer where you could be
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
terminated suspended
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
the state revoked your license we call
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
it a certification so and really they
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
have no power over your employment other
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
than to take away your ability to be a
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
police officer so it
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
is represent Marson
 
04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
one this is not where they're trying to
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
isn't there a provision in the law from
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
and what have that they're actually not
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
just disciplining them they're taking
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.310 --> 04:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
with the intent to get rid of them and
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
that open is it not currently
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.230 --> 04:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
Muse I was wondering if you could give
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
me an example of the sort of
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
confidential information that would
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
create a compelling interest that
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
actually outweighs the Public's right to
 
04:48:10.830 --> 04:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
know and how frequently do you
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
anticipate things like that might come
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
up in the course of the hearings you've
 
04:48:16.350 --> 04:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
been involved
 
04:48:16.360 --> 04:48:18.270 align:start position:0%
been involved
with

04:48:18.270 --> 04:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
um an example of would be strictly
 
04:48:23.310 --> 04:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but like I said things that
 
04:48:24.990 --> 04:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
might involve the names of children or
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
situations that were where the if a
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
police officer was accused of of some
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
type of misconduct against someone were
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
given that the hearing was make it
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
easily identifiable to know who that
 
04:48:39.628 --> 04:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
person was um but generally those type
 
04:48:41.948 --> 04:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
of things are left up FactFinder or the
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
judge has to decide whether or not and
 
04:48:47.470 --> 04:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
there is jurist Prudence on the matter
 
04:48:49.230 --> 04:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
that where they use to guide their
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
decisions as far as about whether or not
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:04.670 align:start position:0%

afternoon uh Mr chairman and members of
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
the committee I strongly urge this
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee to vote not to pass this bill
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
471 i' like to start off quickly with
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
two quotes the first would be from a
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
preamble of chapter 91a our right of no
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
law openness and the conduct of public
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
business is essential to Democratic
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
Society purpose of 91a is to ensure the
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
greatest possible public access to the
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
action discussions and records of all
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
public bodies and their accountability
 
04:51:18.430 --> 04:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
to the people now with respect to the
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City standards and
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
training council is the only licensing
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
body that conducts the business
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
currently historically in private and
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
those days should be gone even without
 
04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I urge the passage of this
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%

Bano I'm 14 I live in Manchester and I'm
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
speaking today on behalf of the New
 
04:54:35.310 --> 04:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School Democrats in
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
04:54:40.270 --> 04:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
471 I support HB 471 because it is a
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
simple solution that will increase
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
police accountability and public trust
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire greatly public
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings are not something
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
limited to New Hampshire across the
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
country there have been calls for this
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
type of legislation organizations like
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
the NAACP and the ACLU have come out in
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
support of publicizing disciplinary
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
hearings New Hampshire could be one of
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
the first states to make this change and
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
show its commitment to transparency and
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
public accountability this legisl is not
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
complicated it is common sense that when
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
people are given the opportunity to act
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
without consequence they will take the
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
easy route and behave improperly we have
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
seen the danger effects of a lack of
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
accountability in the events of recent
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
years and how these systems have
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
impacted New Hampshire specifically
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
keeping these hearings behind closed
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
doors is enabling law enforcement's
 
04:55:22.030 --> 04:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct and telling the people of New
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that our police cannot be
 
04:55:25.708 --> 04:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
trusted transparency has always been a
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
priority in New Hampshire and it's time
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
that we follow through on that
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
commitment were these hearings public it
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
would not only allow New Hampshire
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
citizens to hold police accountable for
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
their actions but it would increase
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
trust within the community and promote a
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
healthier relationship between police
 
04:55:39.510 --> 04:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and those in their jurisdictions I urge
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
h471 thank you for your testimony
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Marston thank you Mr
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
04:55:55.708 --> 04:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
and taking my
 
04:55:58.750 --> 04:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
question you uh I believe have testified
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the past year that you're a high
 
04:56:00.160 --> 04:56:01.788 align:start position:0%
in the past year that you're a high
school

04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
student um yes that correct would that
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
being in mind if you were being
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
disciplined in school would you want the
 
04:56:11.470 --> 04:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
whole school to know what you're being
 
04:56:11.480 --> 04:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
whole school to know what you're being
disciplined

04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
for just please suspend for a moment
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative Marson it's it's I'm
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
gonna ask the witness at least give her
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
the option she's not the answer the
 
04:56:26.670 --> 04:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
difference between a minor involving
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
school records which are confidential uh
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
in par because the person's a minor it's
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a fair comparison to
 
04:56:34.990 --> 04:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
a police officer when it's involving a
 
04:56:37.070 --> 04:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
displine here even if the school records
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
are disciplined I don't think that's a
 
04:56:40.000 --> 04:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
are disciplined I don't think that's a
fair

04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
fair
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
question I would just although the
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
witness is very competent and uh
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
testified well and several times today I
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
would just be uh conscious that we are
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
it is she is a minor as well
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
so representative Marson I will draw my
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
seeing no hand uh no hands raised the
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses excuse and thank you again for
 
04:57:16.200 --> 04:57:18.230 align:start position:0%

Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
in support of HP 471 I have practiced
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
criminal law in New Hampshire for over
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
15 years first as a public defender and
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
now is director of the criminal Practice

Clinic uh at UNH Franklin Pier School of
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
Law I make this statement in my
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
individual capacity and as board member
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
for nhac CDL the opinions I'm expressing
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
are solely M and are not those of either
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
UNH Franklin Pier School of Law or the
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire as a
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
practicing criminal defense lawyer I'm
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
support in support of this bill because
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
it is one way that uh my clients can be
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
guaranteed ACC access to possibly
 
04:58:35.830 --> 04:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence that they are
 
04:58:37.868 --> 04:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
entitled to through the New Hampshire
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
and United States Constitution but I've
 
04:58:42.270 --> 04:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
also had the opportunity to see up
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
closed how the closed door process for
 
04:58:46.470 --> 04:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
hearings on police misconduct breeds
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
suspicion skepticism and distrust within
 
04:58:49.160 --> 04:58:49.868 align:start position:0%
suspicion skepticism and distrust within
our

04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
communities unsurprisingly those who
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
have the courage to bring a complaint
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
about police misconduct to light are
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
some of the same people who find
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
themselves charged with a crime it's
 
04:58:59.708 --> 04:58:59.718 align:start position:0%
hard for so many of my clients to
 
04:59:01.190 --> 04:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
believe that the criminal justice system
 
04:59:02.670 --> 04:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
will treat them fairly when it seems
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
that those charged with enforcing our
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
laws are rarely held accountable that
 
04:59:09.470 --> 04:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
perception may or may not be accurate
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
but without an open and public
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process the community is
 
04:59:14.270 --> 04:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
left to assume that there were no
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
consequences particularly when the same
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
officers are back out on patrol as if no
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
complaint was ever made it is difficult
 
04:59:23.310 --> 04:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
for me to make claim that the justice
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
system is fair when it seems like there
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
are two sets of rules one for my clients
 
04:59:28.990 --> 04:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
and one for police and for clients of
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
color there are a whole extra set of
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
rules dist trust for police by by those
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
being policed affects the entire
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
Community for clients inexperienced with
 
04:59:39.390 --> 04:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system getting
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
their first glimpse of the process they
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
see the power of the State against them
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
when the perception is that police
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
aren't held accountable it's hard to
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
believe they will be treated fairly I've
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
represented people who should have
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
fought their charges but ultimately
 
04:59:54.030 --> 04:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
chose not to do so because they didn't
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
believe they could miss Miss Davis uh we
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
due to time constraints we do have to
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
limit testimony uh to two to two minutes
 
05:00:03.868 --> 05:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
per person do you mind including your
 
05:00:03.878 --> 05:00:09.590 align:start position:0%
per person do you mind including your
your

05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.948 --> 05:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
your yes um I'll just say that in
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
addition to my interactions with clients
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
I do interact with members of the public
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
as jurors as is reflected in my written
 
05:00:24.990 --> 05:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
statement um and those interactions show
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
me that um our jurors who come into
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
court um to serve as community members
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
are also affected by uh the distrust of
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
the police Department um in their
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
decisions about police credibility uh
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave it with that and refer
 
05:00:48.670 --> 05:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%

me I served on Governor sununu's leak
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
commission which is which was
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
established to bring uh much needed
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency to law
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement in our state the
 
05:02:06.270 --> 05:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations we made were to increase
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability and it's
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
in that Spirit of advancing these
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
principles that I strongly urge this
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee to pass this
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation establishes
 
05:02:16.990 --> 05:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
the same standard for law enforcement
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's been set for licensed employees
 
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
lawyers and judges and uh former
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney General Gordon McDonald
 
05:02:25.628 --> 05:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
expressed his support for this type of
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
legislation when he specifically drew
 
05:02:29.548 --> 05:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
the comparison between certification
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
hearings for police vers similar
 
05:02:33.750 --> 05:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
licensing hearings that exist for other
 
05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
professionals I'm asking this committee
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
to support HB 471 because it advances
 
05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
involving situations where law
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement members consciously choose
 
05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
to misrepresent their badge and abuse
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
their positions of power as we saw
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
former Salem Police Sergeant Michael
 
05:02:52.628 --> 05:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
verac's case I am also asking for the
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation because it
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
sends New Hampshire residents in all
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
districts a clear message that this
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee believes in accountability and
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
transparency um when it involves
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
situations of of New Hampshire law
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement members engaging in blatant
 
05:03:08.030 --> 05:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
and public uh racist speech such as we
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
saw in former Manchester police officer
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
Aaron Brown's case now I'm not going to
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
go into details about the case as I
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
recognize conversations around race can
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
be uncomfortable for people who are not
 
05:03:19.310 --> 05:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
ready for it however I haven't met
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who has said that referring to
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire black and brown community
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
members as the n-word or bragging about
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
purchas purchasing a gun to take the mou
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
was acceptable behavior period that's
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
the type of behavior that gets put in
 
05:03:33.628 --> 05:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
front of a decertification here
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
so I would like to just highlight that
 
05:03:36.910 --> 05:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not disregard or
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
infringe upon the due process rights for
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and still provides
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions for sensitive information to
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
be private it's for these reasons and
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
more that I ask that this committee
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
passes this legislation and I'm happy to
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.390 --> 05:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much for your
 
05:03:58.030 --> 05:03:58.040 align:start position:0%

on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
05:05:16.548 --> 05:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
regarding House Bill

471 please note that I signed in as a
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
neutral giving that that that was the
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
best option available however I asked
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
the committee to recognize the New
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs are supportive of the
 
05:05:30.990 --> 05:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill but but with a
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
concern that I that I will
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
explain in the way of introduction I'm a
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of New Hampshire and
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
have been actively involved in law
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement since
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
1962 I've served as police chief in
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
Guilford lebedin and retired after 19
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
years as police chief in Dover after a
 
05:05:50.830 --> 05:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
brief political career that included
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
Service as a state representative and
 
05:05:54.628 --> 05:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
member of the regulated Revenue
 
05:05:56.910 --> 05:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee I continued to develop a
 
05:05:59.230 --> 05:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
police Consulting practice that has
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved working for the past several
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
years with a civil rights division of
 
05:06:06.670 --> 05:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of Justice
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
on police
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
matters the present language of this
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill um talks about the ability for an
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
involved party presumably a police
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
officer to seek closure of a portion of
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing that would disclose
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
confidential perhaps salacious
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
information related or perhaps not
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
allegations that we also support however
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
suggests that the party must prove Pro
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
with specificity that the portion of the
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
hearing will reveal confidential
 
05:06:39.548 --> 05:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
information that creates a compelling
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
interest outweighing The public's
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
presumed right of access Mr chairman and
 
05:06:46.830 --> 05:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee the suggestion
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
person perhaps an open session prove the
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh uh is important
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
negates the whole purpose of the
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
confidential hearing we suggest uh
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislation be made
 
05:07:07.390 --> 05:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
clear that the council the council
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
itself shall have the authority to
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
privately and a non-public session here
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
and consider the request for closure and
 
05:07:17.948 --> 05:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
rule on such requests in closing I very
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
much appreciate the time and attention
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
and emphasize the Chiefs are supportive
 
05:07:25.390 --> 05:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
of public hearings but do suggest there
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
are times when perent evidence may be
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
unduly and
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily invasive of an officer
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
privacy or in the case of potential
 
05:07:38.270 --> 05:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings may be unduly pre
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
prejudicial I assure you that we are
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you in any way
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
possible to clarify these few concerns
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any
 
05:07:54.430 --> 05:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
today thank thank you for your question
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
and the chair if would like to ask a
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
question and I want to thank you in
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
so if I understood your testimony
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
correctly if the concern is one of the
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
concerns is that if an officer word
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
raised the issue of
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that the discussion and
 
05:08:18.150 --> 05:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
I guess presentation of that argument
 
05:08:20.430 --> 05:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
before the the board would have to be
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
done you would want that to be private
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
as well because by asserting it you are
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
essentially breaching compen is that yes
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman that that's correct uh
 
05:08:32.040 --> 05:08:33.230 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman that that's correct uh
uh

05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
although it's not clear it suggests that
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
the person presumably in officer would
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
have to prove uh that this should be a
 
05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
confidential matter and we'd like it to
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
be clear in the legislation while we we
 
05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
believe the hearing should be public uh
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation should be clear that the
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
council uh in non-public session would
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
be able to hear the reasons for uh
 
05:09:01.390 --> 05:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
making that uh public making that
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
non-public and rule on it uh and then if
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
it was uh the ruling was that it would
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
be public well that would be the ruling
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
but if it was uh found to be uh uh an
 
05:09:16.548 --> 05:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
issue that should not be made public
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
then that would be the ruling as well so
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the standards and training Council as
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know includes uh the attorney
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
general and at least two judges so it's
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
not a body that would uh you know not uh
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
lightly seeing No Hands raised I want
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing seeing no M of the
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
public with their hands
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
raised at this point
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
will the public hearing on House Bill
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%

that uh uh for uh for HB 498 I'm putting
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
forward Amendment 2021 d02
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
55h uh essentially this amendment uh
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
now comprises the entire the entire bill
 
05:14:08.548 --> 05:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
um what we've essentially done is we've
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
responded to some of uh judge King's
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
concerns by eliminating the uh the 10
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
County commissions to appoint bail
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh and also essentially
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
leaving the administrative the
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
administration of bail Commissioners uh
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much as is what we've also done
 
05:14:29.470 --> 05:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and what the bill is really all
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
about now uh is making making sure that
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners finally do get paid
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh we've been having this conversation
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
on and off for the last three years uh
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's been a study commission that was
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
put together that representative
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
Alexander and I both served on um and
 
05:14:47.948 --> 05:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we that really
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
came across to us is the hardship uh
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
that this causes to people who really
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
are just trying to help our our police
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh and who are just trying to do the
 
05:14:59.830 --> 05:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
right thing as Citizens um so
 
05:15:01.708 --> 05:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
essentially what the bill what the bill
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
does is it requires that the bail
 
05:15:08.830 --> 05:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fee uh be paid uh by the
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
court if the if uh uh if in incy is
 
05:15:16.030 --> 05:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
determined um and one of the things that
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
judge king told us in his testimony was
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh he suggested that we actually Define
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
indigency the uh
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes these things are can be a
 
05:15:28.750 --> 05:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
little bit hard to remember and recall
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that was part of
 
05:15:33.430 --> 05:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
last year's Criminal Justice uh uh
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Omnibus Bill that actually passed
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
and was signed by the governor um was a
 
05:15:40.990 --> 05:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
provision that essentially ask the
 
05:15:43.150 --> 05:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
administrative Court uh to do that and
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
to define those circumstances so what
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
this what this amendment does is it
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
leaves the requirement that these folks
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know be paid if incy is determined
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
it leaves that requirement intact but it
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
also uh just includes uh A little nudge
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
and reminder uh for the court that this
 
05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
is something that we
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
had asked them to do uh last summer when
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
we passed the previous bill um and part
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
of that the idea isn't just to keep
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
kicking it back and forth between the
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
the circuit court and the legislature
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
but um one of the things I think that's
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
really come across to me having spent a
 
05:16:20.910 --> 05:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
lot of time over this the last few years
 
05:16:23.830 --> 05:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
is the real expertise lies in the
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
circuit administrative Court uh with
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
this and they are in the best position
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
to determine uh to to determine uh how
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
that process should work uh and uh and
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
to to create a process um that ensures
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
that uh that people who can pay do pay
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the people who really can't afford
 
05:16:52.270 --> 05:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
to pay aren't aren't aren't required to
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so that in a nutshell is what we're
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here and and
 
05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can agree on this and put
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
one long-standing problem
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh that's important to a lot of people
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:09.200 --> 05:17:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
represent that was
 
05:17:16.520 --> 05:17:18.430 align:start position:0%
represent that was
cool

05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
cool
 
05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay that was
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:17:24.788 --> 05:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr M
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative m u I just got two two
 
05:17:28.320 --> 05:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
representative m u I just got two two
quick

05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
quick
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions are you so you want to you
 
05:17:34.708 --> 05:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
wish to be recognized to ask represent
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
music question
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh the questions are
 
05:17:44.830 --> 05:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh when a bail
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner sets a go goes and does
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
whatever he's supposed to do uh it's
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
three o'clock in the
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
morning how does he can't decide what is
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
energent uh and
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
he how does the the administrative judge
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
or somebody saying this you know you're
 
05:18:10.270 --> 05:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
Indigent uh make that decision uh and
 
05:18:11.948 --> 05:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to let this guy go
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
on his personal recognizance or not uh
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
and then I got one more question
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
afterwards the bail commissioner uh
 
05:18:24.190 --> 05:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
payment of the fee uh isn't isn't my
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that payment of the fee
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
is not required for somebody to actually
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
be if you don't have if you don't have
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the money
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
um you and and there is no reason to
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
hold you then
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh what what can happen is that somebody
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
can walk out without without necessarily
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
paying the fe uh and that creates an
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
issue mail Commissioners with collecting
 
05:18:51.750 --> 05:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the best the best case scenario is
 
05:18:53.310 --> 05:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
that the people have the money on them
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
or they have their checkbook or
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
something like that and they're actually
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
able to pay the bail commissioner at the
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
time of
 
05:19:00.240 --> 05:19:03.150 align:start position:0%
time of
bail

05:19:03.150 --> 05:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
bail
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay follow up just just before you ask
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
the follow I I don't repres I believe we
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
have to make make the motion again and
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
then I don't believe it was seconded
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
this time around so I think we have to
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
second so I'm raising a point of order
 
05:19:19.558 --> 05:19:22.270 align:start position:0%
second so I'm raising a point of order
on

05:19:22.270 --> 05:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.390 --> 05:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
myself that motion has been
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Hopper
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
represent tesman you may ask question my
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
my last question and the really
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
important one is we there's no question
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
or no answer as to how this gets funded
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
I mean you the the last Bill had a a
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
large Financial uh Clause to it of 800
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
and some thousand uh is that still on it
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
that the uh that that's a that's a
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
actually good question it's not not part
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
of the the nature of this particular
 
05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
Bill itself so I didn't dig into that
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that's part of
 
05:20:13.760 --> 05:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that's part of
1645

05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.040 --> 05:20:18.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:18.670 --> 05:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
question I think the I think the part of
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
the issue is is that the funding uh the
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
the funding for that one of the things
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons to have the the
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
circuit court involved in the the design
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
of the process for determining IND
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
indigency is they can design it in a way
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's fair and also doesn't result in
 
05:20:44.430 --> 05:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the large amount of money that we
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
saw in the fiscal note actually being
 
05:20:48.990 --> 05:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
spent if you if you you know one way to
 
05:20:50.910 --> 05:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
look at that that fiscal node and the
 
05:20:53.070 --> 05:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
way it came across to me is if we
 
05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
literally have no process at all other
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
than somebody being able to say I'm
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
Indigent and they they can walk out then
 
05:21:02.670 --> 05:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
we wind up with uh with an expense of
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
that order but my understanding is is if
 
05:21:07.868 --> 05:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
we you know if if good guidelines are
 
05:21:10.510 --> 05:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
put around this um then the actual
 
05:21:11.788 --> 05:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
amount of money is not going to be
 
05:21:13.708 --> 05:21:13.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere near
 
05:21:13.718 --> 05:21:15.470 align:start position:0%
anywhere near
that

05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay represent news if I can just
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
inquire that so the fiscal note was give
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
or take on the original Bill around
 
05:21:28.350 --> 05:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
$800,000 but is that is that figure
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
Quantified based
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
on no one paying the $40 fee or is that
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
take into consideration I heard
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
testimony about 40 to 50% of the times
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the $4 fees paid right
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
away I think I think it was basically
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
Quantified around the fact that um
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what's happening now so
 
05:21:53.948 --> 05:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
it's about 40 or 50% of the of the
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
people who are involved just basically
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
saying I don't have the money um and
 
05:22:01.230 --> 05:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
part of it is the consequence of not
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
really having guidelines around you know
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh what determines Indy for the purposes
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
of the B fee which is different you know
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
and judge king reminded us of this too
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's different from being Indigent in
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
terms of having representation or
 
05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
councel which tends to be much more
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
expensive the the baill commissioner's
 
05:22:24.270 --> 05:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
fee is
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
$40 so one of the things one of the one
 
05:22:31.390 --> 05:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
of the the challenges as you may not
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily want want to apply exactly
 
05:22:36.070 --> 05:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
the same standards you apply for in
 
05:22:38.430 --> 05:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
agency of council which would be much
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive for something that only
 
05:22:41.040 --> 05:22:45.948 align:start position:0%
more expensive for something that only
costs

05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
$40 representative Maron I have a
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
question for the
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
chair yes okay I'm befuddled a little
 
05:22:56.910 --> 05:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
bit but that's not uncommon for
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
me what I'm interested in being clear on
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
is we did pass this with a 20 to nothing
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
vote and we're now just debating the
 
05:23:10.910 --> 05:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
amendment no that's incorrect what
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
happened was when we opened the
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
executive session I believe on Friday
 
05:23:15.520 --> 05:23:16.788 align:start position:0%
executive session I believe on Friday
February

05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
February
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
5th when we open the executive session
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bert was recognized for a
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass and that motion
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
was seconded after it was open for
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative bur decided
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
wish to withdraw his motion
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and it was withdrawn but as a precaution
 
05:23:37.548 --> 05:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
in housekeeping matter we decided to do
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
that by a roll call vote the re the
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
reason why we did a roll call vote is
 
05:23:43.628 --> 05:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
because on a normal circumstance we
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
could just did a Voice vote but every
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
vote has to be done by roll call since
 
05:23:48.840 --> 05:23:49.868 align:start position:0%
vote has to be done by roll call since
we're

05:23:49.868 --> 05:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:23:52.510 --> 05:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
participating hybrid right now so that's
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
what that was the 20 nothing vote was I
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
believe to
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw most of our
 
05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
pass so we're back to square one
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
well we've made some progress I I would
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
say that there's been now an amendment
 
05:24:07.948 --> 05:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
because but by withdrawing that motion I
 
05:24:10.590 --> 05:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
believe was what inspired this amendment
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
to fix the concerns that a lot of commit
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
had also address some of the testimony
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
provided by judge king so I think the
 
05:24:18.120 --> 05:24:19.150 align:start position:0%
provided by judge king so I think the
amendment

05:24:19.150 --> 05:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
does there's been
 
05:24:21.200 --> 05:24:23.470 align:start position:0%
does there's been
progress

05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
progress
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
say yes so to make it clear for me and
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
maybe some other members I'm not 100%
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
sure but sometimes I'm in that same boat
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
with there with me we got to First do
 
05:24:40.190 --> 05:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
something with the bill and if we do an
 
05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
AR to pass we could do it with an AR to
 
05:24:44.910 --> 05:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
pass and with an
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes an amendment can only be
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
offered with with a positive motion so
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
it the motion it's not the Tas but then
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
you offering an amendment correct have
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
we done that at this point V on we're
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
not we're not voting on the AR to pass
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's it has to be but there has to be a
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
positive motion pres
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
presented that's ought to pass amendment
 
05:25:16.350 --> 05:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
I understand that are we looking at that
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
if this point in time what we need to do
 
05:25:21.750 --> 05:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
now is is actually adopt the we need to
 
05:25:23.310 --> 05:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment we got pass the
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment then we do not pass with
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
them point a question
 
05:25:33.788 --> 05:25:33.798 align:start position:0%
I was under the impression and and and I
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
defer to some senior people
 
05:25:40.670 --> 05:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
here you have to pass the bill first and
 
05:25:42.990 --> 05:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
then put an amendment to it no the
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
motion will be on to pass for Amendment
 
05:25:47.390 --> 05:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we we have to adopt the
 
05:25:50.948 --> 05:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
amendment if if the amendment fails then
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
we'll vote to pass on the original bill
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.240 --> 05:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
Bard thank you Mr chairman a couple of
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
points a has I have served as
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
a and the first thing you do in a bill
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
that looking at is uh to adopt an
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendment does not have to be positive
 
05:26:35.990 --> 05:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt Amendment so if the
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted and there
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
is is that a point of order that you're
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
making I making a couple of comments my
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that in order
 
05:26:50.270 --> 05:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
for an amendment to be presented there
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be a positive motion present my
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
that is my source for that is the CL so
 
05:27:01.230 --> 05:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
if you look if you look at the CL work
 
05:27:05.470 --> 05:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
sheet that tells you the recording of
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
the moot motion the motion to adopt
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is the first border of
 
05:27:14.350 --> 05:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
business yes I correct and what I'm what
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
I am saying is you representative Bo let
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
me just explain
 
05:27:20.830 --> 05:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
this okay have to adopt the motion first
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
but it has to be you can't have an A A
 
05:27:26.708 --> 05:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
an amendment on an itl motion so what
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is that there's a positive
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
motion right now and then you're
 
05:27:32.030 --> 05:27:32.040 align:start position:0%

05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
oh let's understand so the other thing
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
is as far as uh the money uh this bill
 
05:27:47.470 --> 05:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
has a fin Financial note on it so it
 
05:27:50.990 --> 05:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
will be going to finance and finance
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
will uh decide on
 
05:27:56.350 --> 05:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
money uh so we don't have to worry about
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
that right now thank
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:01.708 align:start position:0%
that right now thank
you

05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bourne uh so just so the
 
05:28:08.110 --> 05:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
members understand we're supposed to he
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
said represent B corrected his analysis
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
that there where cage to not always
 
05:28:15.390 --> 05:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
factor in the fiscal side of things
 
05:28:18.910 --> 05:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
however I am uh my own opinion my as a
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative I don't ignore the fiscal
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
notes if if the fiscal is not not proper
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that I'm obligated to
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
ignore it but in this case I will say
 
05:28:31.990 --> 05:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal not aside
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have bail Commissioners not getting
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
paid and they doing a public service I I
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
can't wrap my head around how this has
 
05:28:40.628 --> 05:28:40.638 align:start position:0%
been going on that long and I I know
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work put into this
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
trying to come to some resolution there
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
was a commission I know two members
 
05:28:48.910 --> 05:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
sitting on the committee today were
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
involved in that and bipar and effort
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
so and I just know if I was doing a job
 
05:28:56.590 --> 05:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
and not getting paid I I probably
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't continue to do it so the I
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
really respect the bail commissioners in
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
their Public Service they're providing
 
05:29:01.878 --> 05:29:03.150 align:start position:0%
their Public Service they're providing
and

05:29:03.150 --> 05:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:06.270 --> 05:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
this sols that I mean I couldn't imagine
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
getting out of bed at four o'clock in
 
05:29:09.390 --> 05:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
the morning or 3 o'clock in the morning
 
05:29:14.230 --> 05:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
driving a half hour to to do a do my
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
public service and then not get paid for
 
05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
$40 then to drive
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
back so we're gonna we're g to move the
 
05:29:21.840 --> 05:29:23.628 align:start position:0%
back so we're gonna we're g to move the
question

05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
um represent H you making a point of
 
05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
order yeah point of order uh Mr chairman
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
um just because because it has a
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
physical note it depends on the finance
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee how swamp they are they can
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
choose not to even hear this so it
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily go to the finance
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
committee it should but it may
 
05:29:44.680 --> 05:29:47.070 align:start position:0%
committee it should but it may
not

05:29:47.070 --> 05:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's that is a correct statement uh
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
they they the second committee can
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
always wave the second committee they
 
05:29:56.430 --> 05:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
can wave it off so that's happened
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
before it can happen in
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
finance I just I just want to say when
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
we were um looking at this I what I
 
05:30:07.390 --> 05:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
remember distinctly is of Representative

05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
just drop everything after
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
that Bas and that's what they did yeah
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
I'm waiting to support
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%

Attorney General imposed a suspension on

no knock raides executed without a

attempt to better analyze and predict
 
05:42:05.350 --> 05:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
when no knock raids will become
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
excessively violent as you can see noock
 
05:42:09.708 --> 05:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
raids present some of the most dangerous
 
05:42:11.788 --> 05:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
assignments during a police officer
 
05:42:14.350 --> 05:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
shift in the case of Chief Maloney the
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
shooters died in a murder suicide during
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
the ordeal no one survived to be held
 
05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
accountable for chief Maloney's death
 
05:42:23.110 --> 05:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
but if they had it's possible it would
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
have gone the way of Deputy Adam st's
 
05:42:28.030 --> 05:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
death in a 2013 incident in Bolson
 
05:42:29.948 --> 05:42:29.958 align:start position:0%
County Texas
 
05:42:31.948 --> 05:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
police made a surprise raid at the home
 
05:42:34.510 --> 05:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
of Henry McGee to collect evidence of
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
his marijuana growing operation as
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
officers entered the home un announed
 
05:42:41.468 --> 05:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
McGee opened fire fatally wounding
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy solders McGee was initially
 
05:42:45.788 --> 05:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
charged with capital murder which
 
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
carries out which carries the death
 
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
penalty in Texas but his attorney argued
 
05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
self-defense because officers had not
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
announced themselves prior to entry
 
05:42:56.468 --> 05:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
McGee was able to argue that he didn't
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
know whether a criminal was entering his
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
home in the end a grand Jerry agreed
 
05:43:03.548 --> 05:43:03.558 align:start position:0%
that McGee had acted in self-defense he
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
served only 18 months on the related
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
drug charges and has since been
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
released when we ensure that police
 
05:43:11.468 --> 05:43:11.478 align:start position:0%
officers make just one clear
 
05:43:12.868 --> 05:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
announcement before entering the
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
premises we deny a murderer the
 
05:43:17.070 --> 05:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to claim self-defense and
 
05:43:18.910 --> 05:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
evade responsibility after they take the
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
life of a police
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
officer at times police even mistakenly
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
raid the wrong address which results in
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
an innocent family's home being raided
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
in 2014 drug enfor forcement officers
 
05:43:30.990 --> 05:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
broke down the front door of a
 
05:43:32.468 --> 05:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
Manchester home to find a grandmother
 
05:43:33.750 --> 05:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
inside with two
 
05:43:35.708 --> 05:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
grandchildren an officer's weapon
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
misfired and the grandmother was shot in
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
the back while she was reaching for a
 
05:43:41.310 --> 05:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
grandchild police found no drugs in the
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
home and no arrest were made as the
 
05:43:44.350 --> 05:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
people they were looking for didn't live
 
05:43:44.360 --> 05:43:45.070 align:start position:0%
people they were looking for didn't live
there

05:43:45.070 --> 05:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
anymore when law enforcement does not
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
announce their presence the inhabitants
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the home could conclude that they're
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
the victims of a home invasion the
 
05:43:54.990 --> 05:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester grandmother was not armed but
 
05:43:56.670 --> 05:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't always the case especially in
 
05:43:59.070 --> 05:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
a state like New Hampshire furthermore
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
consider castle doctrine the idea that
 
05:44:03.390 --> 05:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
individuals can use deadly force to
 
05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
defend themselves against an Invader in
 
05:44:07.788 --> 05:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
their own home this is a concern that
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
this committee dealt with just last week
 
05:44:11.788 --> 05:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
nof raids conflict with the fact that
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
people are permitted to defend
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
themselves in their own home as it
 
05:44:16.750 --> 05:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
stands it's unclear who would be held
 
05:44:19.230 --> 05:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
accountable if a law-abiding gun owner
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
attempts to defend her home if she
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
misperceives a raid on the wrong address
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
as being a home invasion will she lose
 
05:44:26.590 --> 05:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
her second amendment rights will she be
 
05:44:28.030 --> 05:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime and imprisoned for
 
05:44:30.670 --> 05:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
defending her home and her family no
 
05:44:32.468 --> 05:44:32.478 align:start position:0%
knock raids put police officers in
 
05:44:34.990 --> 05:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary danger no knock warrants in
 
05:44:36.670 --> 05:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
combination with castle doctrine are
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
arest for disaster to protect police and
 
05:44:41.310 --> 05:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
the public alike we need to ensure that
 
05:44:42.788 --> 05:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
police properly announce themselves
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Maron thank you
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for your testimony
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
and your your
 
05:45:00.670 --> 05:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill my question is this time does this
 
05:45:03.310 --> 05:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
apply to just New Hampshire L
 
05:45:06.468 --> 05:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement or would this pertain to
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
Federal oh thank you for your question
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that we have the
 
05:45:15.468 --> 05:45:15.478 align:start position:0%
ability to dictate how Federal
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
authorities um behave in our
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
state and so um I believe that this only
 
05:45:23.708 --> 05:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
would apply to uh New Hampshire police I
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
mean that's a good question it's
 
05:45:27.070 --> 05:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
something I haven't considered but um I
 
05:45:28.990 --> 05:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
think considering that we've had had
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
bills in the state before which were
 
05:45:32.788 --> 05:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
attempts to control the types of things
 
05:45:34.750 --> 05:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
that police can uh Federal authorities
 
05:45:35.830 --> 05:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
can do in our state I think we've had
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills about preventing police uh Federal
 
05:45:42.750 --> 05:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
authorities from collecting or rounding
 
05:45:46.670 --> 05:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
up guns I think we've had bills about um
 
05:45:50.110 --> 05:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
ice uh you know immigration so I think
 
05:45:52.390 --> 05:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
that there's um I think that your
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
question might really be um a
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional debate as to whether
 
05:46:02.590 --> 05:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
state can control Federal authorities um
 
05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
that might be a state versus Federal
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
authority issue um but I would I would
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh venture to Guess that this bill only
 
05:46:12.468 --> 05:46:12.478 align:start position:0%
applies to um police within our control
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
follow I understand do you understand
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
the reason why in the law as it stands
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:35.750 --> 05:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
warrant can I'm sorry can you rephrase
 
05:46:38.910 --> 05:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
the question are you just asking me if I
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
understand or are you asking me to
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm curious that to know
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
whether you understand why there is such
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
a thing as a no not
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
why thank you for the question
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the purpose
 
05:47:05.190 --> 05:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
of a no not warrant is to prevent the
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be serve with the
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
warrant from destroying evidence however
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that
 
05:47:16.190 --> 05:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um
 
05:47:19.590 --> 05:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
because a noock warrant can really only
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
be justified in situations where there
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
are not large amounts of drugs because
 
05:47:27.070 --> 05:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
keep in mind if if you suspect someone
 
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
of having a large amount of drugs
 
05:47:30.590 --> 05:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
then odds are very low that they'd be
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
able to destroy that in a short amount
 
05:47:33.868 --> 05:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
of time in the time it takes to announce
 
05:47:35.350 --> 05:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
yourself which is really the difference
 
05:47:36.750 --> 05:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
between a warrant and a no knock warrant
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
is just saying hello I'm the police so
 
05:47:41.468 --> 05:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
in that amount of time if it's very
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to destroy the amount of
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that the suspects are believed
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
to have then as I understand it the no
 
05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
KN would would not be issued so if
 
05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
someone has bricks and bricks and Bricks
 
05:47:55.708 --> 05:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
of cocaine or what have you um they're
 
05:47:58.468 --> 05:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
not going to entertain a knowof warrant
 
05:48:01.708 --> 05:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh odds are because there's no
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
justification there's no it's not
 
05:48:04.590 --> 05:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
believable that they'd be able to
 
05:48:08.468 --> 05:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
destroy that evidence however if uh a
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
judge considers a request for know not
 
05:48:13.468 --> 05:48:13.478 align:start position:0%
warrant and they see that the suspect is
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
believ to only have a small amount of
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
drugs then they're more likely to
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
approve the request for no enough
 
05:48:19.948 --> 05:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
warrant but unfortunately the position
 
05:48:22.708 --> 05:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
that that puts policemen in is that
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're now risking their lives uh
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
risking gunfire risking violence um
 
05:48:29.948 --> 05:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
risking death for a small amount of
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
drugs for only being able to take a
 
05:48:31.600 --> 05:48:43.708 align:start position:0%
drugs for only being able to take a
small

05:48:43.708 --> 05:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
am issued in situations where maybe
 
05:48:48.430 --> 05:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
maybe someone could argue it's worth
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
risking a policeman's life but the vast
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
majority of the time it's just not worth
 
05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
it and it seems like if someone has a
 
05:48:55.150 --> 05:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
small amount of drugs you can probably
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
just pull them over um I'm not a
 
05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
policeman but I know that have other
 
05:49:02.830 --> 05:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
ways uh to detain people to uh make sure
 
05:49:04.948 --> 05:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
this search happens and if you have a
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
small amount of drugs then while and
 
05:49:11.190 --> 05:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
they not want maybe may fit the
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
requirements because you could argue
 
05:49:13.868 --> 05:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
that they could destroy that small
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs the question becomes is
 
05:49:19.548 --> 05:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
it worth risking the death of someone's
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
father someone's husband you know or
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
someone's wife just to get a small
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:27.520 --> 05:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
drugs

05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
one representative Mar one
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
last are you aware and if so how many no
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
KN warrants do we have happening in a
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
years time in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um unless
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
someone has statistics to provide us my
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that statistics of this
 
05:49:50.190 --> 05:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
kind aren't kept in New
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire didn't understand it's my
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that statistics of this
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
kind are not maintained in our state
 
05:49:56.240 --> 05:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
kind are not maintained in our state
thank

05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:49:57.440 --> 05:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
thank
you

05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative test thank you Mr
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm torn between two
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
conditions one you know not and you make
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
a mistake and somebody inside the
 
05:50:21.868 --> 05:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
apartment or wherever is injured by the
 
05:50:21.878 --> 05:50:22.788 align:start position:0%
apartment or wherever is injured by the
police

05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
officer the other one is you go through
 
05:50:29.070 --> 05:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
the identification process that outline
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill and the person inside the
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
the uh apartment has time to get a
 
05:50:41.468 --> 05:50:41.478 align:start position:0%
firearm and the policeman is injured
 
05:50:44.670 --> 05:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
now how do we make a decision which
 
05:50:46.468 --> 05:50:46.478 align:start position:0%
which is the more important the
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:51:00.070 --> 05:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:51:02.350 --> 05:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a lot of situations in
 
05:51:04.510 --> 05:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where there's an attempt
 
05:51:07.510 --> 05:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
to execute a warrant and notice is given
 
05:51:11.190 --> 05:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then it's met with violence um it's
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
I would suppose that there's just a
 
05:51:15.628 --> 05:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
tendency against this and I'm not saying
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
that there haven't been incidents of
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
violence against police in New Hampshire
 
05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
there's been many of them and we're
 
05:51:22.110 --> 05:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
aware of them and there's roads named
 
05:51:24.270 --> 05:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
after those people you know traffic
 
05:51:28.590 --> 05:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
circles and and such um but I I don't
 
05:51:31.510 --> 05:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
believe that many of those incidents
 
05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
occurred when um PE when police were
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
serving uh a warrant and announce
 
05:51:41.390 --> 05:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
themselves but I'm not sure if I really
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
addressed your question because it was a
 
05:51:43.040 --> 05:51:45.310 align:start position:0%
addressed your question because it was a
little

05:51:45.310 --> 05:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
little
 
05:51:48.190 --> 05:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
complex have then if you want to ask me
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
another you described
 
05:51:54.070 --> 05:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
in you described in in great detail what
 
05:51:56.468 --> 05:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
happened over in Greenland where the
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
police came on the porch basically they
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
came under Fire there were a lot of
 
05:52:04.390 --> 05:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
injuries that it's very similar to a
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
situation where they knew what was the
 
05:52:09.788 --> 05:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
perpetrator knew they were coming for
 
05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and and had time to to
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
to gather his arms and and cause a lot
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
of problems and that's no different than
 
05:52:26.590 --> 05:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
you know a no knock Warrant Where you
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
you tell the person hey I'm I'm looking
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
for you I'm I'm going to come in and and
 
05:52:34.270 --> 05:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
you know you all be ready well they may
 
05:52:38.910 --> 05:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
be ready and you get shot again so I you
 
05:52:41.788 --> 05:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
you you clearly stated the issue in the
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
Greenland one but you know I I'm at a
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
loss here to just determine what you
 
05:52:51.990 --> 05:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
know which is the more more important
 
05:52:55.150 --> 05:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
person inside or the person
 
05:52:58.350 --> 05:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
outside um thanks for the question it's
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
like maybe you're trying I would imagine
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
that you would believe that the life of
 
05:53:04.830 --> 05:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
the police officer is very important and
 
05:53:06.270 --> 05:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like maybe you're trying to
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
determine whether um it would be more
 
05:53:10.510 --> 05:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
likely for there to be violence if
 
05:53:13.390 --> 05:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
policemen announce themselves versus if
 
05:53:16.150 --> 05:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
they don't and that is the focus of the
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that there have been
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
high-profile incidents in New Hampshire
 
05:53:22.510 --> 05:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
where police officers were injured or
 
05:53:24.708 --> 05:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
killed because they didn't announce
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
themselves and the unfortunate
 
05:53:27.628 --> 05:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
consequence is that when they don't
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
announce themselves eles and someone is
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
killed or someone is hurt the person who
 
05:53:34.830 --> 05:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
hurt them cre evade responsibility by
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
claiming self-defense because they
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
didn't announce themselves so that's the
 
05:53:40.910 --> 05:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
trouble and it's it is probably
 
05:53:43.868 --> 05:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
impossible to determine whether uh
 
05:53:45.628 --> 05:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
violence is more likely to occur if they
 
05:53:48.110 --> 05:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
announce themselves versus if they don't
 
05:53:48.120 --> 05:53:50.350 align:start position:0%
announce themselves versus if they don't
um

05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
but we can at least ensure that when
 
05:53:54.990 --> 05:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
there is violence people will be held
 
05:53:57.310 --> 05:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
accountable because police announce
 
05:53:59.708 --> 05:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
themselves and they and they at least
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
give people um they take away the
 
05:54:05.670 --> 05:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the shooter to say I
 
05:54:07.350 --> 05:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
thought it was a home invasion I didn't
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
know that the police were there if I
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
knew it was the police I would have
 
05:54:12.270 --> 05:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
cooperated they could say things like
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
that and there was the man in my uh
 
05:54:16.830 --> 05:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that I mentioned in Texas who
 
05:54:18.990 --> 05:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
did exactly that and instead of the
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
capital punishment he got 18 months in
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
jail for pot you know and that's um a
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
light and day difference on how that
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
case could have turned out um in light
 
05:54:29.350 --> 05:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
of what he did and he's you know
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
literally a free man having killed a
 
05:54:33.788 --> 05:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
policeman so I think that
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
the I think that the consequences of not
 
05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
announcing themselves are so severe that
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's important to establish a pol policy
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
of announcing um Ved for police uh so
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we can at least hold people
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
accountable even if at the end of the
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
day we can't predict the future I hope I
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:57.000 --> 05:55:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:55:03.590 --> 05:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.600 --> 05:55:07.868 align:start position:0%
 
repres

05:55:07.868 --> 05:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
Proby what police have
 
05:55:16.030 --> 05:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
enter at what point do they say they are
 
05:55:18.670 --> 05:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
the police that
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
specified how far can this go without
 
05:55:21.240 --> 05:55:23.468 align:start position:0%
specified how far can this go without
somebody

05:55:23.468 --> 05:55:23.478 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:55:25.788 --> 05:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
KN um I think that that's a question
 
05:55:27.788 --> 05:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
better directed that maybe um if there
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
any policemen signed up to speak today I
 
05:55:31.830 --> 05:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
think that they could speak more
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
authoritatively on that
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
you seeing seeing no further question
 
05:55:50.548 --> 05:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
05:55:50.558 --> 05:55:53.310 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
green

05:55:53.310 --> 05:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
green
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
I are you familiar with the show out in
 
05:55:56.920 --> 05:55:58.708 align:start position:0%
I are you familiar with the show out in
brw

05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
brw
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you'll have to remind me is
 
05:56:03.070 --> 05:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
there a followup yes please follow up is
 
05:56:04.510 --> 05:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
there going to be a question there too
 
05:56:05.628 --> 05:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
yes it will
 
05:56:09.390 --> 05:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
be she asked for some information on it
 
05:56:12.270 --> 05:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh it was a knock situation uh it was in
 
05:56:14.190 --> 05:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
a 55 and older
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
community uh the policeman knocked and
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
entered the place of residence and he
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
was shot on the spot and killed and then
 
05:56:26.830 --> 05:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
there was uh other policeman showed up
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
and it was SWAT
 
05:56:31.350 --> 05:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department local police and in
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
the end uh the person inside the house
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
decided to commit suicide and set the
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
place on
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
fire that's what happened and that's
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
what happens when you do a
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
KN so my question is it's all doesn't it
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
depend on the type of the situation
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
whether it should be a knock or no
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
KN thank you for the question
 
05:56:59.868 --> 05:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
yeah it does depend but generally the
 
05:57:02.948 --> 05:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
criteria comes down to whether um
 
05:57:05.390 --> 05:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
whether there is a likelihood that these
 
05:57:08.030 --> 05:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
suspects will be able to destroy
 
05:57:10.990 --> 05:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
evidence um otherwise a normal warrant
 
05:57:11.000 --> 05:57:11.830 align:start position:0%
evidence um otherwise a normal warrant
is

05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:57:11.840 --> 05:57:13.350 align:start position:0%
is
expected

05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
expected
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
and um that is why I mentioned in my
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that after the incident with
 
05:57:23.708 --> 05:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
Chief Maloney in uh Greenland uh the
 
05:57:26.430 --> 05:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General did put together
 
05:57:29.430 --> 05:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
some um what's the
 
05:57:33.670 --> 05:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
terminology a matrix of risk assessment
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
to try to determine um or try to predict
 
05:57:41.230 --> 05:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
when any given uh raid might become more
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
violent than expect you know than would
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
normally be reasonable I suppose um so
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
that they could better prepare to
 
05:57:49.200 --> 05:57:50.548 align:start position:0%
that they could better prepare to
protect

05:57:50.548 --> 05:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
protect
 
05:57:54.190 --> 05:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
themselves um and that was they they
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
decided to design that system because
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
they realized that just uh a noof raid
 
05:58:01.948 --> 05:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
by itself was far too dangerous for
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
police to participate
 
05:58:06.990 --> 05:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
in um but unfortunately I just don't
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
remember that story and maybe the names
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
of the uh officers involved might ring a
 
05:58:16.350 --> 05:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
bell how long ago was it about six years
 
05:58:18.390 --> 05:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
ago and I think I know what you're
 
05:58:18.400 --> 05:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
ago and I think I know what you're
referring

05:58:19.990 --> 05:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
referring
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
to sorry I'm a little I'm not going down
 
05:58:25.750 --> 05:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
there just one one at a time try try to
 
05:58:25.760 --> 05:58:26.708 align:start position:0%
there just one one at a time try try to
be

05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:28.948 align:start position:0%
be
recognized

05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
you have aoll question yeah I was going
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
to ask the committee if anyone knew what
 
05:58:35.070 --> 05:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
the officer's name was that was skilled
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
incident now's not the
 
05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
listen gson
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
walls I respect the Fallen officer if
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know the name yes is representative
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh officer stepen Rell from the
 
05:58:53.070 --> 05:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
constituents it's not going any I mean I
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't mean do with disrespect to the
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
officer but
 
05:59:01.390 --> 05:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
we have a witness testify that let the
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:12.750 --> 05:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
question seeing no further questions the
 
05:59:17.390 --> 05:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:20.190 --> 05:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
you before I call the next witness on
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
our list um representative
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative lebranch you on the list
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
now I I should have corrected this last
 
05:59:27.360 --> 05:59:28.350 align:start position:0%
now I I should have corrected this last
time

05:59:28.350 --> 05:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I was actually initially wrong about
 
05:59:32.310 --> 05:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
this during orientation it was a point
 
05:59:32.320 --> 05:59:33.430 align:start position:0%
this during orientation it was a point
of

05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
order talk to the clerk and I I now see
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
the light if if you're the prime sponsor
 
05:59:43.230 --> 05:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
of a bill then and you're a member of
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
the committee you're substitute the
 
05:59:48.430 --> 05:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
committee you at that point cannot
 
05:59:49.868 --> 05:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
participate in the public hearing as a
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
member of the committee if you are a
 
05:59:55.350 --> 05:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but don't testify you can
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%

05:59:59.948 --> 05:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
questions to Witnesses so you're on the
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
list to testify but you're free to wave

06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
record I'm Tony lebranch I represent
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
Amhurst New Hampshire which is Hillsboro
 
06:00:40.230 --> 06:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
22 um and I'm here to say that we live
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
in a country of Freedom Every Man's home
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
is his castle we also live in a country
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
with the Second Amendment where we can
 
06:00:53.548 --> 06:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
own AR we can bear arms uh so if you
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
were home sleeping in bed and you heard
 
06:00:58.750 --> 06:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
the door break down what would you do if
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
you were a gun owner would you protect
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
yourself protect your family and protect
 
06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
your property you don't know who just
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
broke down your door is it an officer is
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
it somebody breaking into your home so
 
06:01:12.390 --> 06:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
that is what I'm asking of this
 
06:01:15.110 --> 06:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee what would you do if the door
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
broke down at your house maybe the
 
06:01:19.510 --> 06:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
police are at the wrong address maybe
 
06:01:21.628 --> 06:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
you're Innocent but you do not know who
 
06:01:24.548 --> 06:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
is at your door and I'm scared that
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
people will have their guns taken away
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
their rights taken away they will be
 
06:01:29.708 --> 06:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
given a felony conviction because they
 
06:01:30.990 --> 06:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know who was at the door who
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
broke down their door so that is all I
 
06:01:35.990 --> 06:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to say think about what you would
 
06:01:38.190 --> 06:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
do when your door is broken down and you
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%

testimony that the Attorney General
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
wrote guidelines for uh no knock
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
warrants recently do we know of any um
 
06:02:04.030 --> 06:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants that have gone AR rise
 
06:02:08.750 --> 06:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
outline besides what happened to bana
 
06:02:13.230 --> 06:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
Taylor in the state of Kentucky I do not
 
06:02:15.628 --> 06:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
know of any New Hampshire examples uh

since that new
 
06:02:26.110 --> 06:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:28.670 --> 06:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
you uh seeing no testimony I want to
 
06:02:32.110 --> 06:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for his
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:56.280 --> 06:03:00.788 align:start position:0%
 
silver

06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.990 --> 06:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair can you

turn the video I've been promoted I'm

gonna promote the witnesses to panelist
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%

just I'll leave it thank you for the
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak about this bill uh
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
I would urge the committee to deem it in
 
06:03:30.750 --> 06:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate it seems to me
 
06:03:34.628 --> 06:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
that there are three basic situations in
 
06:03:37.350 --> 06:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
which a noock warrant might be
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
justified where there is a known
 
06:03:41.708 --> 06:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
proclivity of the occupants to be
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
violent against law
 
06:03:46.110 --> 06:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's known to be firearms
 
06:03:46.990 --> 06:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
premises and there is a a Bonafide fear
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
of Destruction or secretion of evidence
 
06:03:52.200 --> 06:03:53.468 align:start position:0%
of Destruction or secretion of evidence
and

06:03:53.468 --> 06:03:53.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
Contraband basically it seems to me that
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the number one job of government is
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and our law enforcement
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
officers are on the front lines on a
 
06:04:07.150 --> 06:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
daily basis and they have a very
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous job when they're serving
 
06:04:12.270 --> 06:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
warrants as opposed to prohibiting
 
06:04:15.468 --> 06:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
outright no knock warrants I suggest
 
06:04:17.708 --> 06:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
that there's two possible ways to deal
 
06:04:22.468 --> 06:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
with them first of all RSA 595 A4 has
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
the provisions for the affidavit to get
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
a search warrant for a neutral magist
 
06:04:30.430 --> 06:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
rate if they we should put in perhaps an
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
amendment that that section could be
 
06:04:36.270 --> 06:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
amended to have specific Provisions to
 
06:04:38.110 --> 06:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
justify the issuance of a no knock
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
warrant such as the things the outlines
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the the situations that I outlined as
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
far as the concern about law enforcement
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
breaking into with a no knock warrant
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
breaking into the wrongful premises it
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me and one of the the basic
 
06:04:59.628 --> 06:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
problem is is that they have immunity
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
for making mistakes so if we want to
 
06:05:04.110 --> 06:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
deal with that issue which is also a
 
06:05:07.390 --> 06:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
slippery slope perhaps we reduce or
 
06:05:10.110 --> 06:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate that immunity based on
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
mistakes if they make a mistake based on
 
06:05:14.430 --> 06:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
negligence or gross negligence and go
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
into the wrong premises and damage the
 
06:05:19.510 --> 06:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
wrong premises or injure someone then
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
they ought to be held responsible for
 
06:05:24.788 --> 06:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
that but don't in the the majority of
 
06:05:26.350 --> 06:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
cases they're not going to be going into
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
the wrong premises
 
06:05:30.468 --> 06:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
they need to protect themselves and by
 
06:05:32.750 --> 06:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
doing by having an affidavit in support
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
of an onok warrant which lays out
 
06:05:38.708 --> 06:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
specifically under oath why it's needed
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
I think that that's should be
 
06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and should solve this issue
 
06:05:45.788 --> 06:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
so I urge the committee to itl this Bill
 
06:05:45.798 --> 06:05:52.750 align:start position:0%
so I urge the committee to itl this Bill
thank

06:05:52.750 --> 06:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions I want to thank

abis and the members of the committee my
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
name is Gregory dulio and I'm a sergeant
 
06:06:50.948 --> 06:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
with the Manchester Police Department
 
06:06:52.270 --> 06:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
I've been a resident of the State of New
 
06:06:53.868 --> 06:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a police officer for the
 
06:06:56.590 --> 06:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
last 15 years I currently serve as a
 
06:06:58.390 --> 06:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
first L supervisor of the special
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement division special
 
06:07:02.350 --> 06:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
investigations unit will we deal with
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
the detection of organized criminal
 
06:07:06.468 --> 06:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
activity intelligence gathering and
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
narcotics enforcement I'm also a team
 
06:07:11.230 --> 06:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
leader for the Department SWAT team I'd
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
like to thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:07:15.150 --> 06:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
speak before you in opposition of House
 
06:07:17.548 --> 06:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 507 and on behalf of my department
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
and also the New Hampshire Association
 
06:07:22.350 --> 06:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
of chiefs of police I just want to speak
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
briefly about the no knock warrants and
 
06:07:26.430 --> 06:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
knock and announced warrants I both have
 
06:07:28.030 --> 06:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
a pretty good experience personal
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
experience with both of them
 
06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the no knock warrants have
 
06:07:33.548 --> 06:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
recently gained negative national
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
attention due to a few tragic incidents
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
that have occurred outside of New
 
06:07:40.548 --> 06:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no knock warrants are highly
 
06:07:43.030 --> 06:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
effective and if executed properly
 
06:07:45.070 --> 06:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
provide the highest level of safety for
 
06:07:49.628 --> 06:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
the public officers and suspects if 507
 
06:07:51.868 --> 06:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
were to pass officers would not have an
 
06:07:54.670 --> 06:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
option to execute a no knock warrant and
 
06:07:56.350 --> 06:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
would be held to a knock and announce
 
06:07:56.360 --> 06:07:57.390 align:start position:0%
would be held to a knock and announce
warrant

06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:07:59.310 --> 06:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire tactical teams across
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
the state take great pride in their
 
06:08:03.110 --> 06:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
investigations preparation and execution
 
06:08:05.230 --> 06:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
of these warrants I can speak from
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
experience that I have seen the benefits
 
06:08:09.670 --> 06:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
of no knock warrants in which a suspect
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
has attempted to arm themselves upon our
 
06:08:14.310 --> 06:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
arrival if a no knock warrant had not
 
06:08:16.110 --> 06:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
been executed the result of that
 
06:08:18.110 --> 06:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
investigation could have ended with a
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
lethal engagement instead of a peaceful
 
06:08:23.310 --> 06:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
surrender as far as the sponsor of the
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh who presented it
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
earlier it seemed like she kept on
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
saying that it was for the preservation
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
of evidence that was the reason why this
 
06:08:34.030 --> 06:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill is being brought forward that is
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
not the reason for no knock search
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
warrants um like the last gentleman that
 
06:08:41.708 --> 06:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier he talked about
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
individuals inside of a residents that
 
06:08:45.788 --> 06:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
are possibly armed we're trying to
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
contain them within the residents upon
 
06:08:51.230 --> 06:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
our arrival to basically eliminate what
 
06:08:53.230 --> 06:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
happened down in Sunrise Florida
 
06:08:55.750 --> 06:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
recently with two FBI agents were fairly
 
06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
shot and killed when they went up to a
 
06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
door and they knocked they knocked first
 
06:09:01.708 --> 06:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
which required the suspect inside the
 
06:09:03.750 --> 06:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
house to arm himself and shoot the
 
06:09:06.150 --> 06:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
police offices that road
 
06:09:09.628 --> 06:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
side I do have to limit accept my apolog
 
06:09:11.150 --> 06:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
I do have to limit testimony the general
 
06:09:13.548 --> 06:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
public to two minutes per witness you
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
just mind providing
 
06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
testimony yes sir uh just in Clos and I
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
ask that you find host Bill 507 in

exponential legislate in if you have any
 
06:09:28.948 --> 06:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
questions I'm more than happy to to

06:09:37.830 --> 06:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um Sergeant question
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
I asked earlier I wonder if you could
 
06:09:42.350 --> 06:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
shed some light on can you explain the
 
06:09:45.910 --> 06:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
process of a noof warrant uh at what
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
point you would identify yourselves as
 
06:09:51.350 --> 06:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
police once you enter someone's
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
home yes absolutely um a no knock
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
warrant is obviously a search one
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
authorizing highly trained police off
 
06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
officers which is usually our SWAT team
 
06:10:02.190 --> 06:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
or other SWAT teams throughout the state
 
06:10:04.270 --> 06:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
to enter a premise without first
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
knocking announcing their presence or
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
purpose immediately upon entering the
 
06:10:12.190 --> 06:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
premise and I and everyone understands
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
is entering the premise just everyone
 
06:10:15.670 --> 06:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
thinks that the means that the police go
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
running through the premise all we're
 
06:10:20.510 --> 06:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
doing is creating an opening whether it
 
06:10:23.708 --> 06:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
be a door or window and immediately upon
 
06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
the opening of a window of a door loud p
 
06:10:29.468 --> 06:10:29.478 align:start position:0%
announcements are made to the point
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
where people block several blocks away
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
from where we are can clearly hear that
 
06:10:36.548 --> 06:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
we are the police so the individuals
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
inside the residents know that we are
 
06:10:40.750 --> 06:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
the police and we are not there to do an
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
armed home
 
06:10:45.190 --> 06:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
inv by us being able to do that we can
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
control where people are inside the
 
06:10:49.830 --> 06:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
address and prevent them from Gaining a
 
06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
firearm or potentially harming other
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.558 --> 06:10:59.070 align:start position:0%
 
address

06:10:59.070 --> 06:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative calling recognize for
 
06:11:05.788 --> 06:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:08.868 --> 06:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
follow and this is purely uh for
 
06:11:10.830 --> 06:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
information gathering I'm not asking for
 
06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
any reason would you not be able to
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
arrest most people in U or interdict
 
06:11:20.350 --> 06:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
them in situations that would uh you
 
06:11:22.110 --> 06:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
know when they're walking to a vehicle
 
06:11:23.788 --> 06:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
when they're you know is that a
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
possibility if you do that uh to the
 
06:11:27.948 --> 06:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
extent possible to avoid these
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous knock or no knock
 
06:11:36.868 --> 06:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
situations yes that is uh 100% we do
 
06:11:40.030 --> 06:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
that uh daily we take all these um
 
06:11:42.510 --> 06:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
factors into account and if possible if
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
we can safely take someone into custody
 
06:11:46.510 --> 06:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
without having to conduct a no knock
 
06:11:48.670 --> 06:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
warrant we would 100% would do that
 
06:11:51.788 --> 06:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
before executing a warrant like that um
 
06:11:53.910 --> 06:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
it is our goal is to provide our
 
06:11:56.070 --> 06:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
officers our community and the people
 
06:11:57.868 --> 06:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
that these people reside with inside
 
06:12:00.910 --> 06:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
this address um their safety is are is
 
06:12:03.468 --> 06:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
Paramount at that point in
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
time representative Hopper uh thank you

of any issues since the new guidelines
came

06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
came
 
06:12:25.440 --> 06:12:27.070 align:start position:0%
came
out

06:12:27.070 --> 06:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:12:29.310 --> 06:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
no sir I do not know of any uh any new
 
06:12:31.868 --> 06:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
issues sir thank
 
06:12:34.990 --> 06:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Marston thank you Mr
 
06:12:37.270 --> 06:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you assigned for taking
 
06:12:37.280 --> 06:12:38.070 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you assigned for taking
my

06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:12:40.590 --> 06:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm hoping you know the answer
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
but for the edification of myself and my
 
06:12:46.708 --> 06:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
fellow members here before you have a no
 
06:12:50.590 --> 06:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
not warrant you must present a a request
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
for one before a federal judge is that
 
06:12:56.390 --> 06:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
correct sir it depends if the case is a
 
06:12:59.310 --> 06:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
federal case or if it's a state case if
 
06:13:01.548 --> 06:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
um if it is a state case it would go
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
before a district court um or a superior
 
06:13:07.390 --> 06:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
court and then um obviously if it was a
 
06:13:09.190 --> 06:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
federal case it would be brought before
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the a USA's office and they would pre
 
06:13:13.110 --> 06:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
they would look at the facts of the case
 
06:13:15.948 --> 06:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
and they would uh they would uh justify
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether what type of Warrant was going
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
to be issued at that time represent Mar
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
you follow yes thank you
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mr s how many no warrants do we have
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the last year in the state
 
06:13:30.750 --> 06:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
of New
 
06:13:33.750 --> 06:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have those numbers um
 
06:13:36.030 --> 06:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
right off hand for you
 
06:13:39.150 --> 06:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
um all I can say is um as far as a
 
06:13:41.430 --> 06:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester does execute them
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
align with knock U knock and announce
 
06:13:46.510 --> 06:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
warrant as well um but I can't give you
 
06:13:48.910 --> 06:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
a a number um a definitive number at
 
06:13:48.920 --> 06:13:50.310 align:start position:0%
a a number um a definitive number at
this

06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
time represent Mars another followup
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr your best
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:06.788 --> 06:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
number did you hear my question yes sir
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just uh taking a minute to think
 
06:14:10.468 --> 06:14:10.478 align:start position:0%
about the the number of warrants I would
 
06:14:13.030 --> 06:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
I would say probably about 50 50 no
 
06:14:15.190 --> 06:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
knock warrants along with a handful of
 
06:14:17.270 --> 06:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
knock and announce warrants depending on
 
06:14:19.548 --> 06:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
if it was a federal case or
 
06:14:22.390 --> 06:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
not thank
 
06:14:24.868 --> 06:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:14:27.868 --> 06:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
Jeff thank you Mr Mr chair um thank you
 
06:14:30.548 --> 06:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
Sergeant for taking my question um do
 
06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
you know what the difference is with or
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
what addition that um that's been added
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
knock can you um clarify that question
 
06:14:45.990 --> 06:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
having a tough time understand what
 
06:14:48.990 --> 06:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
you're asking it was spoken that um
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
there has been I guess an addition or
 
06:14:56.548 --> 06:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
updated no knock warrant that came out
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
of the court so I'm just curious as to
 
06:15:02.548 --> 06:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
what was it that was that was something
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
that was implemented by the Attorney
 
06:15:07.548 --> 06:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
General's office after the Greenland uh
 
06:15:10.030 --> 06:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
officer involved shooting um and that
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
was uh guidelines that were set forth at
 
06:15:13.350 --> 06:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
that point in time I do not have them in
 
06:15:16.030 --> 06:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
front of me at the
 
06:15:22.468 --> 06:15:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
you Sergeant the chair has a question
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you in advance for
 
06:15:29.788 --> 06:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
06:15:32.990 --> 06:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
question so in addition to the
 
06:15:34.990 --> 06:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of evidence
 
06:15:37.628 --> 06:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
is the thought of evidence being
 
06:15:39.548 --> 06:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
destroyed is one reason to get a know
 
06:15:42.830 --> 06:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
War I always understood that the other
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
scenario would be circumstances
 
06:15:48.468 --> 06:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
where the officer safety would be
 
06:15:51.390 --> 06:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardized by knocking or announcing
 
06:15:53.310 --> 06:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
your pres so one of the reasons why the
 
06:15:53.320 --> 06:15:54.750 align:start position:0%
your pres so one of the reasons why the
offic

06:15:54.750 --> 06:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
offic
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
would not anounce their presence for
 
06:15:58.788 --> 06:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
their own safety is
 
06:16:03.230 --> 06:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
that is there any is that a correct uh
 
06:16:04.830 --> 06:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance where no not warrant would
 
06:16:04.840 --> 06:16:06.510 align:start position:0%
circumstance where no not warrant would
be

06:16:06.510 --> 06:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:16:08.628 --> 06:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
sought so you're I just want to make
 
06:16:10.230 --> 06:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear on what you're asking so
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
you're asking that if an officer would
 
06:16:16.590 --> 06:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
feel that his safety would be in
 
06:16:18.750 --> 06:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy yes by announcing their
 
06:16:21.868 --> 06:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
presence sometimes correct I'll give you
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
a prime example um these these no knock
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
warrant Wars are usually weak you know
 
06:16:30.670 --> 06:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
approximately about a month to several
 
06:16:32.708 --> 06:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
month long investigations in which we
 
06:16:35.708 --> 06:16:35.718 align:start position:0%
learn um through Intel Gathering
 
06:16:37.868 --> 06:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
confidential informats some stuff along
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
those lines about people having firearms
 
06:16:41.948 --> 06:16:41.958 align:start position:0%
with inside the residence with us going
 
06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
up and knocking on a door or a window
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
um it's the officer safety that we're
 
06:16:50.670 --> 06:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about that this person would
 
06:16:53.468 --> 06:16:53.478 align:start position:0%
potentially go grab a firearm um and do
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
harm to the police because most of these
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
investigations sometimes we receive
 
06:16:59.468 --> 06:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
information about resistance to the
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
police um so yes that's uh that is one
 
06:17:04.640 --> 06:17:04.650 align:start position:0%

Hampshire High School Democrats in
 
06:17:56.830 --> 06:17:56.840 align:start position:0%

507 I am in support of hb7 as I believe
 
06:18:01.628 --> 06:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
it is a step in the right direction
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
towards solving the issue that plagues
 
06:18:05.468 --> 06:18:05.478 align:start position:0%
this nation police brutality this
 
06:18:07.150 --> 06:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
country has seen the danger and tragedy
 
06:18:08.788 --> 06:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
that comes along with Nook Warren most
 
06:18:10.628 --> 06:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
pointedly earlier in 2020 when we were
 
06:18:12.510 --> 06:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
all shaken by the murder of Briana
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Taylor on March 13th 2020 the Louisville
 
06:18:17.070 --> 06:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
Police Department entered the apartment
 
06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
where bana Taylor was sleeping along
 
06:18:20.708 --> 06:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
with her partner Kenneth Walker these
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
officers were issued a no knock search
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
warrant for the apartment but these
 
06:18:25.628 --> 06:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
police officers were not in any clothing
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
that indicated they were with law
 
06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement and did not clearly identify
 
06:18:30.030 --> 06:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
themselves before entering the apartment
 
06:18:32.310 --> 06:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
with a battering ram the events that
 
06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
unfolded ultimately left an officer
 
06:18:35.590 --> 06:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
injured and an innocent unarmed black
 
06:18:38.230 --> 06:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
woman dead I would also like to address
 
06:18:39.468 --> 06:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
something that has been mentioned before
 
06:18:40.708 --> 06:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
today by pointing out that Kenneth
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
Walker did have time to find his gun and
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
fire it even though the officers did not
 
06:18:47.030 --> 06:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
announce themselves neglecting to inform
 
06:18:48.670 --> 06:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
Walker of the situation did not stop him
 
06:18:50.230 --> 06:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
from using force it simply made the
 
06:18:51.868 --> 06:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
situation more chaotic and led to more
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
pain for everyone involved including the
 
06:18:56.910 --> 06:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
officers hp5 was 7 contains two vital
 
06:18:57.948 --> 06:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
points that will be crucial in
 
06:18:59.948 --> 06:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
preventing future tragedies like these
 
06:19:01.670 --> 06:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
first the police officers must identify
 
06:19:03.070 --> 06:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
themselves clearly to anyone who could
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
be in the residence and may only enter
 
06:19:07.150 --> 06:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
using Force once due notice is given
 
06:19:08.670 --> 06:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
secondly the police officers must be in
 
06:19:10.150 --> 06:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
clearly identifiable
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
uniforms had Mr Walker known that the
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
Invaders were police officers on March
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
13th and was able to respond accordingly
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
Rihanna Taylor would still be alive
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
today this bill is not only about the
 
06:19:21.948 --> 06:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
difference between knocking or not this
 
06:19:23.628 --> 06:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
bill to many people of color in the in
 
06:19:25.030 --> 06:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire could save
 
06:19:27.548 --> 06:19:27.558 align:start position:0%
lives do not allow branna Taylor to have
 
06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
died a fruitless death but use her
 
06:19:30.468 --> 06:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
Legacy to build safer and better
 
06:19:31.788 --> 06:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
communities and to reform law
 
06:19:34.030 --> 06:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement in this country I urge the
 
06:19:35.270 --> 06:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee to join the New Hampshire High
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%

06:20:30.788 --> 06:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm quite interested in in this sort

criminology uh although I do not
 
06:20:41.310 --> 06:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
currently work in the field
 
06:20:46.590 --> 06:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to speak today uh in support
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
of abolishing uh the no knock warrant
 
06:20:56.190 --> 06:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
um I I understand what the officer that
 
06:21:00.670 --> 06:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier was saying um however I
 
06:21:04.990 --> 06:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
would have to agree with what uh uh the
 
06:21:07.830 --> 06:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
member of the committee stated earlier I
 
06:21:11.548 --> 06:21:11.558 align:start position:0%
believe it was the member from
 
06:21:14.670 --> 06:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro um
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
and excuse me it it's true um in
 
06:21:24.468 --> 06:21:24.478 align:start position:0%
that under the Second Amendment yes we
 
06:21:26.190 --> 06:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
do have the right to own
 
06:21:26.200 --> 06:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
do have the right to own
firearms

06:21:29.830 --> 06:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:33.670 --> 06:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
and if your door were to come flying
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
open um in the darkness of night or even
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
during the
 
06:21:41.670 --> 06:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
daylight uh most people would be quite
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
startled by it and I think if you had a
 
06:21:50.670 --> 06:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
firearm nearby would be likely to grab
 
06:21:54.150 --> 06:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
it possibly use it because as he said
 
06:21:58.270 --> 06:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
you have no idea who that might be
 
06:22:02.948 --> 06:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:06.788 --> 06:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
um under the Fourth Amendment um of the
 
06:22:08.948 --> 06:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
United States
 
06:22:08.958 --> 06:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
United States
Constitution

06:22:10.830 --> 06:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh there is a plethora of case law out
 
06:22:20.190 --> 06:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
there um on search and seizure um and
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
the the main thing tends to be
 
06:22:24.558 --> 06:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
the the main thing tends to be
reasonableness

06:22:28.070 --> 06:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:33.040 align:start position:0%

06:25:03.628 --> 06:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
with everything that Sergeant Tulio said
 
06:25:05.070 --> 06:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
and I would like to reiterate that no
 
06:25:06.750 --> 06:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
knock warrants are of tremendous value
 
06:25:08.830 --> 06:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
to Tactical teams throughout the state
 
06:25:10.510 --> 06:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
executing search warrants is in my
 
06:25:12.628 --> 06:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
opinion the most dangerous task officers
 
06:25:14.270 --> 06:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
perform in the course of their duties
 
06:25:15.910 --> 06:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
and banning no knock warrants will lead
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
to more of us getting severely injured
 
06:25:19.788 --> 06:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
or killed part of my job as a team
 
06:25:21.230 --> 06:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
leader is planning search warrant
 
06:25:23.708 --> 06:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
services and quite frankly I can't
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
imagine having to serve a search warrant
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
on a suspect who is known to be armed
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
and dangerous but having to knock first
 
06:25:30.788 --> 06:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
this will only give the suspect a chance
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
to shoot through the door or to lie in
 
06:25:34.590 --> 06:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
wait to sit in the Ambush when we do
 
06:25:36.350 --> 06:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
make entry which is exactly what
 
06:25:38.310 --> 06:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
happened to the FBI agents in
 
06:25:40.110 --> 06:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
Florida I do think there are some
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about nonok warrants and
 
06:25:43.270 --> 06:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
with a little education people wouldn't
 
06:25:45.868 --> 06:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
be calling for a complete ban on them
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
for one there seems to be a belief that
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
when a no knock warrant is served that
 
06:25:51.990 --> 06:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
we burst through the door in jeans and
 
06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
t-shirts and rush through the house
 
06:25:55.628 --> 06:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
without identifying ourselves in New
 
06:25:57.948 --> 06:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is simply not the case we
 
06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
use highly trained well-marked officers
 
06:26:02.110 --> 06:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
who issue clear announcements that are
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
nearly simultaneous to the entry and
 
06:26:07.708 --> 06:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
another myth is that we just use no
 
06:26:09.310 --> 06:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
knock search warrants to preserve
 
06:26:12.150 --> 06:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
evidence or quote to get the dope again
 
06:26:14.750 --> 06:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
simply not true in Nashua we do not let
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the need or desire to save drug evidence
 
06:26:19.830 --> 06:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
dictate our tactics rather we ask the
 
06:26:21.750 --> 06:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
court for a no knock warrant because we
 
06:26:23.468 --> 06:26:23.478 align:start position:0%
need to arrest someone in a house who is
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
believed to be armed and dangerous and
 
06:26:27.548 --> 06:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
likely resistant to the warrant
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
service in reference the example that
 
06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
was provided about Greenland in 2012 I'd
 
06:26:34.830 --> 06:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
really like to clear something up that
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
was not a no knock warrant service
 
06:26:39.628 --> 06:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
although these Drug Task Force officers
 
06:26:42.070 --> 06:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
applied and received a no knock warrant
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
that is not how they served it they
 
06:26:45.830 --> 06:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
knocked and
 
06:26:47.788 --> 06:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
announced but when those attempts were
 
06:26:50.070 --> 06:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
futile that's when they made entry and
 
06:26:50.080 --> 06:26:52.548 align:start position:0%
futile that's when they made entry and
received

06:26:52.548 --> 06:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:54.670 --> 06:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
gunfire a subsequent review of this
 
06:26:55.948 --> 06:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
incident by the attorney's general
 
06:26:57.868 --> 06:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
office indicated that
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
fact and also noted that the delayed
 
06:27:02.390 --> 06:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
entry provided the
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
suspect Sergeant Lane Sergeant Lane I
 
06:27:07.190 --> 06:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
accept my apology we do have to limit
 
06:27:09.948 --> 06:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
testimony of two minutes per per per
 
06:27:12.430 --> 06:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
person so if you don't mind just
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
including your testimony within a sent
 
06:27:18.590 --> 06:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:21.868 --> 06:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
two yes sir I understand the Attorney
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
General said quote more than sufficient
 
06:27:25.390 --> 06:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
time to prepare his armed respon resp to
 
06:27:28.030 --> 06:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
the entry in my opinion no knock
 
06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
warrants should not be banned because
 
06:27:30.910 --> 06:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
they are needed in some circumstances
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
and in closing I ask that you find HB
 
06:27:35.510 --> 06:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
507 inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
06:27:36.788 --> 06:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
for your
 
06:27:39.390 --> 06:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
time representative Newman you recognize
 
06:27:39.400 --> 06:27:40.628 align:start position:0%
time representative Newman you recognize
for

06:27:40.628 --> 06:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:27:43.230 --> 06:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
and Sergeant Lang thank you for your
 
06:27:46.750 --> 06:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and I just want to just
 
06:27:49.548 --> 06:27:49.558 align:start position:0%
clarify something that you said about
 
06:27:53.468 --> 06:27:53.478 align:start position:0%
safety of offices reference uh obtaining
 
06:27:55.708 --> 06:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
um evidence so
 
06:27:58.270 --> 06:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
is my understanding correct if I think
 
06:28:01.548 --> 06:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
that there is always a safety concern
 
06:28:05.468 --> 06:28:05.478 align:start position:0%
about some someone being Al armed and
 
06:28:08.390 --> 06:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
potentially um is going to use that
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
Armed Force against the offices is that
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
the only time that you have a no
 
06:28:16.310 --> 06:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
knock sir thank you for your question
 
06:28:18.510 --> 06:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
and state and federal law carves out
 
06:28:20.430 --> 06:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the knock requirement one
 
06:28:22.110 --> 06:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
is evidence preservation and the other
 
06:28:24.468 --> 06:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
is that the uh officers for some reason
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
face an increased level of of threat to
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
themselves when they make entry every
 
06:28:29.990 --> 06:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
Tactical Team is different every state
 
06:28:31.310 --> 06:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
is different in how they do it and when
 
06:28:34.390 --> 06:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
I indicate that uh we here in Nash don't
 
06:28:36.230 --> 06:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
do it for evidence uh that's what I mean
 
06:28:39.390 --> 06:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
so we we don't do no knock warrants for
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
evidence we do it when we think that
 
06:28:44.430 --> 06:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
someone inside is armed and they might
 
06:28:46.310 --> 06:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
be resistant to the warrant or they
 
06:28:48.110 --> 06:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
intend on harming us or somebody else in
 
06:28:48.120 --> 06:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
intend on harming us or somebody else in
the

06:28:53.430 --> 06:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:57.628 --> 06:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
house represent and you recognize for a
 
06:29:00.750 --> 06:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman So based
 
06:29:04.030 --> 06:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
on what you just said um do you think
 
06:29:04.040 --> 06:29:05.670 align:start position:0%
on what you just said um do you think
that

06:29:05.670 --> 06:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:08.910 --> 06:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
the you would be more acceptable to a
 
06:29:13.468 --> 06:29:13.478 align:start position:0%
warrant to a law law like this um being
 
06:29:18.350 --> 06:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
passed if it clearly um allowed for no
 
06:29:20.310 --> 06:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
knock warrants on the for the safety of
 
06:29:23.830 --> 06:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
the officer but prohibited them for the
 
06:29:27.430 --> 06:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
sir I think that would depend uh I would
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
hate to see it banned outright um
 
06:29:34.270 --> 06:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
anytime evidence was s because depending
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
on the nature of the crime uh the
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
evidence could be crucial to building a
 
06:29:39.990 --> 06:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
case so I think what would be better
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be uh a judge's review on a
 
06:29:44.230 --> 06:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis for every no knock
 
06:29:45.510 --> 06:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
search warrant whether or not it's for
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
evidence or to protect the safety of the
 
06:29:49.948 --> 06:29:49.958 align:start position:0%
officers who are going
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:53.840 --> 06:29:55.628 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:29:55.638 --> 06:29:58.590 align:start position:0%
you
representative

06:29:58.590 --> 06:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking my
 
06:30:03.270 --> 06:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
question one of the things that I'm
 
06:30:07.910 --> 06:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
curious about is when noo warrant
 
06:30:11.948 --> 06:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
started to become something that police
 
06:30:14.990 --> 06:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
departments uh were doing I I don't
 
06:30:18.910 --> 06:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
recall ever watching a 1940s 1950s or
 
06:30:18.920 --> 06:30:19.910 align:start position:0%
recall ever watching a 1940s 1950s or
even

06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
even
 
06:30:23.628 --> 06:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
1960s movie or TV show where they did do
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
yor were where no knock warrants were
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
actually being done so I'm curious is
 
06:30:31.230 --> 06:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
this a a relatively new thing in
 
06:30:32.830 --> 06:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
policing or is it something that's been
 
06:30:34.750 --> 06:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
around with us for a long
 
06:30:38.910 --> 06:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
time uh sir I would know exactly uh when
 
06:30:41.350 --> 06:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
they gained popularity I do believe the
 
06:30:46.150 --> 06:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
War on Drugs maybe in the 80s led to um
 
06:30:47.468 --> 06:30:47.478 align:start position:0%
them becoming a little more prevalent
 
06:30:49.110 --> 06:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
with the the need at the time to
 
06:30:50.708 --> 06:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
preserve evidence and uh you know kind
 
06:30:53.230 --> 06:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
of kind of as we has evolved as a
 
06:30:55.468 --> 06:30:55.478 align:start position:0%
society um I don't have any St for you
 
06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm pretty confident in saying that
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
at least in New Hampshire um the
 
06:31:01.670 --> 06:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
practice of conducting them for for
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
evidence preservation has gone down will
 
06:31:06.030 --> 06:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
we still try to use them when we can um
 
06:31:10.750 --> 06:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
inside representative Muse you
 
06:31:13.990 --> 06:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
06:31:18.990 --> 06:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes I'm also wondering how you
 
06:31:24.030 --> 06:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate the success of uh of serving a
 
06:31:25.510 --> 06:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
no knock warant
 
06:31:25.520 --> 06:31:26.670 align:start position:0%
no knock warant
and

06:31:26.670 --> 06:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
um what kind of what kind of process
 
06:31:33.548 --> 06:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
there is around for just sort of
 
06:31:36.910 --> 06:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating um actions you know a little
 
06:31:39.708 --> 06:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
bit of a kind of a almost like a Monday
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
Morning Quarterback review kind of a
 
06:31:44.430 --> 06:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
thing that police departments may do
 
06:31:47.948 --> 06:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:50.510 --> 06:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
process sure uh I think I want to touch
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
on the risk assessment thing that got
 
06:31:53.788 --> 06:31:53.798 align:start position:0%
brought up by the sponsor earlier um she
 
06:31:55.230 --> 06:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
was almost putting in in text that the
 
06:31:57.510 --> 06:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
risk assessments are done to evaluate
 
06:31:59.708 --> 06:31:59.718 align:start position:0%
the danger of the person or the house
 
06:32:02.388 --> 06:32:02.398 align:start position:0%
and while that's true I believe she was
 
06:32:04.590 --> 06:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
indicating that if there was a a
 
06:32:06.070 --> 06:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
heightened level of threat then the
 
06:32:07.788 --> 06:32:07.798 align:start position:0%
warrant simply wouldn't be served and
 
06:32:09.150 --> 06:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
the police wouldn't take any kind of
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
action that that's simply not true risk
 
06:32:14.468 --> 06:32:14.478 align:start position:0%
assessments are put in place um to
 
06:32:16.990 --> 06:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate how dangerous somebody is and
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of serving the warrant
 
06:32:19.910 --> 06:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
or not it's a matter of who serves it
 
06:32:21.948 --> 06:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
whether it be Patrol and detectives or
 
06:32:23.590 --> 06:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
if they seek the advice of a Tactical
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
Team um so if the Tactical team does the
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation and they make the
 
06:32:29.468 --> 06:32:29.478 align:start position:0%
determination uh that their
 
06:32:31.708 --> 06:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
participation is appropriate at that
 
06:32:33.310 --> 06:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
point they evaluate whether or not
 
06:32:34.708 --> 06:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
they'll serve a knock and announce or a
 
06:32:36.830 --> 06:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
no knock and then to get back to your
 
06:32:40.230 --> 06:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
question after the warrant is served um
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
we have what is called an after action
 
06:32:44.190 --> 06:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
review and we talk about everything from
 
06:32:45.910 --> 06:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
the planning process through the warrant
 
06:32:48.590 --> 06:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
service and uh we do evaluate on a
 
06:32:50.190 --> 06:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
case-by Case basis whether or not it
 
06:32:52.270 --> 06:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
worked and to touch on the second part
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
of your question how we evaluate if it
 
06:32:54.240 --> 06:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
of your question how we evaluate if it
worked

06:32:55.590 --> 06:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
worked
 
06:32:58.510 --> 06:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's usually obvious uh
 
06:33:01.548 --> 06:33:01.558 align:start position:0%
we're able to U make an entry point into
 
06:33:03.670 --> 06:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
the residents like sergeant pulio said
 
06:33:06.110 --> 06:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
and then people surrender
 
06:33:09.070 --> 06:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
peacefully um and if nobody gets hurt uh
 
06:33:11.070 --> 06:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the the main goal here
 
06:33:12.510 --> 06:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of the situation and that
 
06:33:14.030 --> 06:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
that means we were
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
successful thank
 
06:33:20.350 --> 06:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
you representative board day thank you
 
06:33:22.750 --> 06:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
06:33:25.830 --> 06:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
question uh have you or anyone in your
 
06:33:27.708 --> 06:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
department ever gone to the wrong
 
06:33:32.110 --> 06:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:34.468 --> 06:33:34.478 align:start position:0%
warrant I'm sorry could you repeat the
 
06:33:37.110 --> 06:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
question I say have you or anyone in
 
06:33:39.548 --> 06:33:39.558 align:start position:0%
your department ever gone to the wrong
 
06:33:42.548 --> 06:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
address when serving an a
 
06:33:45.070 --> 06:33:45.080 align:start position:0%

apartment for the third floor
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
fortunately we were able to determine
 
06:33:51.670 --> 06:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
that a mistake had been made before we
 
06:33:52.948 --> 06:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
actually made
 
06:33:57.910 --> 06:33:57.920 align:start position:0%

06:36:15.868 --> 06:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
question I don't want to say that it's
 
06:36:19.190 --> 06:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
frequent um but our our detectives do
 
06:36:21.750 --> 06:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
06:36:24.030 --> 06:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis to be honest with
 
06:36:26.030 --> 06:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
you it's so I don't have uh an exact

pleas sir I'm having trouble hearing you
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
but just so I can make I understand the
 
06:36:56.670 --> 06:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
question you're asking how a homeowner
 
06:36:58.110 --> 06:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
would know the difference between a home
 
06:37:07.708 --> 06:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:10.750 --> 06:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
warrant okay uh like sge Theo said uh
 
06:37:14.110 --> 06:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
the difference is uh a very loud police
 
06:37:16.670 --> 06:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
announcement these are not stealth uh
 
06:37:18.750 --> 06:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
missions by any means um we use a
 
06:37:20.990 --> 06:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
combination of PA systems in our
 
06:37:23.310 --> 06:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles loud verbal announcements at
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
the door and and as part of our best
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
practice uh we make sure those
 
06:37:29.948 --> 06:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
announcements are made before entry
 
06:37:32.270 --> 06:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
regardless if it's a knock warrant or a
 
06:37:40.030 --> 06:37:40.040 align:start position:0%

06:38:07.190 --> 06:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
no I didn't have a question I might have
 
06:38:08.670 --> 06:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
my hand might have looked like it was
 
06:38:08.680 --> 06:38:11.990 align:start position:0%

mentioned uh before when representative
 
06:38:27.030 --> 06:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
Bardon a question um about going to the
 
06:38:30.468 --> 06:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
wrong floor of an apartment building my
 
06:38:33.150 --> 06:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
question is when you don't
 
06:38:36.430 --> 06:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
knock uh for a warrant and you storm
 
06:38:40.150 --> 06:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
into a community living situation that
 
06:38:42.750 --> 06:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
affects multiple people how do you
 
06:38:46.708 --> 06:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:50.150 --> 06:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
community um I think I'm going to try to
 
06:38:52.510 --> 06:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
answer that with h two parts first as
 
06:38:54.430 --> 06:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
far as storming in um I want be clear
 
06:38:55.788 --> 06:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
that that's it's our best practice that
 
06:38:58.628 --> 06:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
we don't storm in um whether it's a
 
06:39:00.430 --> 06:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
knock an announce or a knock like
 
06:39:03.150 --> 06:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
sergeant dulo said we do what we call as
 
06:39:05.468 --> 06:39:05.478 align:start position:0%
a breach which is is essentially opening
 
06:39:07.948 --> 06:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
a door or window and then we make ano
 
06:39:10.388 --> 06:39:10.398 align:start position:0%
announcements from that point and then
 
06:39:12.430 --> 06:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
as far as the rest of the community uh
 
06:39:14.350 --> 06:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
we do everything we can in every warrant
 
06:39:16.750 --> 06:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
service to evacuate the people in the
 
06:39:18.788 --> 06:39:18.798 align:start position:0%

06:39:31.590 --> 06:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you chair I just um
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
can I wonder what that looks like let's
 
06:39:36.990 --> 06:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
say there's a children playing outside
 
06:39:41.110 --> 06:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
in a apartment building and you have to
 
06:39:44.830 --> 06:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
go in what what is the protocol for that
 
06:39:46.830 --> 06:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
how do you know do you find their
 
06:39:48.548 --> 06:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
parents these are
 
06:39:51.708 --> 06:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
miners um they're W witnessing that is
 
06:39:51.718 --> 06:39:52.948 align:start position:0%
miners um they're W witnessing that is
this

06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:39:52.958 --> 06:39:54.628 align:start position:0%
this
okay

06:39:54.628 --> 06:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:39:56.990 --> 06:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh we take extra steps as far as the
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
timing of these warrant services to make
 
06:40:02.350 --> 06:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
sure that uh kids are in school and we
 
06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
do everything we can in the planning
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
process to mitigate those kind of
 
06:40:08.830 --> 06:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
concerns but if we get there um we make
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
sure we Scout the location ahead of time
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
and we do everything we can leading up
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
to it to clear um uninvolved people you
 
06:40:18.750 --> 06:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
know especially children out of the area
 
06:40:20.310 --> 06:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the immediate moments leading up to
 
06:40:22.310 --> 06:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
the warrant service and um I I don't
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
want to get too much into what that
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
looks looks like uh know for our own job
 
06:40:29.708 --> 06:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
reasons but um you know we really go out
 
06:40:30.788 --> 06:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
of our way to make sure that everybody's
 
06:40:40.590 --> 06:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:42.750 --> 06:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
service thank you Sergeant seeing no
 
06:40:45.110 --> 06:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
further hands raised I want to thank the
 
06:40:49.300 --> 06:40:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:49.310 --> 06:40:52.830 align:start position:0%

507
 
06:42:12.910 --> 06:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
um most of the testimony you've heard
 
06:42:15.788 --> 06:42:15.798 align:start position:0%
today I would simply be repeating but I
 
06:42:18.708 --> 06:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
think something that has rung true
 
06:42:21.070 --> 06:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the testimony is is the
 
06:42:24.230 --> 06:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
dangers faced uh by law enforcement
 
06:42:28.230 --> 06:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
certainly law enforcement today the the
 
06:42:32.628 --> 06:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
ability to have as a tool although
 
06:42:35.190 --> 06:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
extremely um strict Protocols are in
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
place to use this tool the no knock
 
06:42:41.788 --> 06:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
warrant um these warrants are not you
 
06:42:44.948 --> 06:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
know simply approved you know without
 
06:42:46.990 --> 06:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
scrutiny these warrants go through a
 
06:42:48.788 --> 06:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
very strict scrutiny process and are
 
06:42:50.830 --> 06:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
signed by a neutral and detached you
 
06:42:54.750 --> 06:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
know third- party judge um
 
06:42:56.670 --> 06:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a critical
 
06:42:59.350 --> 06:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
tool to remain in
 
06:43:02.030 --> 06:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
place to allow law enforcement to do
 
06:43:04.030 --> 06:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
their jobs in the safe manner as
 
06:43:06.468 --> 06:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
possible um taking into account the
 
06:43:08.350 --> 06:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
absolute dangers you know that are
 
06:43:10.350 --> 06:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
facing officers
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
today um New
 
06:43:15.750 --> 06:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it a little bit better
 
06:43:18.750 --> 06:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
than a lot of the rest of the country
 
06:43:20.270 --> 06:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
which is why we have these strict
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
protocols already in place and I would
 
06:43:23.040 --> 06:43:24.190 align:start position:0%
protocols already in place and I would
encourage

06:43:24.190 --> 06:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the committee uh to to
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
please listen to the testimony from the
 
06:43:33.670 --> 06:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
officers that have testified today and
 
06:43:36.548 --> 06:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
keep this valuable tool in place uh
 
06:43:38.388 --> 06:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that we already have
 
06:43:40.628 --> 06:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
very strict you know protocols
 
06:43:43.070 --> 06:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
associated with it and with that I'll
 
06:43:51.430 --> 06:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
you repres views
 
06:43:56.990 --> 06:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um I'm
 
06:43:58.990 --> 06:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
just curious about what type of
 
06:44:01.388 --> 06:44:01.398 align:start position:0%
protocols New Hampshire may have in
 
06:44:04.190 --> 06:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
place around no Kno warrants that other
 
06:44:09.350 --> 06:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
states um who might be having we are um
 
06:44:12.708 --> 06:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:15.310 --> 06:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
have well without being able to speak
 
06:44:18.070 --> 06:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
with specificity I I think what you've
 
06:44:20.548 --> 06:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
seen um through the professionalization
 
06:44:23.310 --> 06:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement in New Hampshire is
 
06:44:27.270 --> 06:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
have having very strict protocols and
 
06:44:29.548 --> 06:44:29.558 align:start position:0%
the biggest is having the neutral and
 
06:44:32.708 --> 06:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
detached third party the judge uh sign
 
06:44:35.430 --> 06:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
off on these these are not you know
 
06:44:38.270 --> 06:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
warrants that you can have signed by a
 
06:44:41.548 --> 06:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
justice of the peace or or some other
 
06:44:44.708 --> 06:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know party it has to be a judge that
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the you know the the
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
protocols that individual agencies have
 
06:44:55.270 --> 06:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
in place and and Nasha was a perfect
 
06:44:58.590 --> 06:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
example you heard testimony that even
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
though authorized to make a no knock
 
06:45:05.468 --> 06:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
warrant for um evidentiary
 
06:45:10.868 --> 06:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
purposes they don't do that so um many
 
06:45:14.788 --> 06:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
many police departments have an even uh
 
06:45:18.030 --> 06:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
more strict standard than they may be
 
06:45:20.750 --> 06:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
allowed under law and that that's sort
 
06:45:23.750 --> 06:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
of you know the the type of example exle
 
06:45:26.070 --> 06:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
that I would use of of things that we do
 
06:45:30.788 --> 06:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:33.070 --> 06:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative M recognize for
 
06:45:34.270 --> 06:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
a followup
 
06:45:38.628 --> 06:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um if have you or
 
06:45:41.468 --> 06:45:41.478 align:start position:0%
has your department Revisited any of the
 
06:45:44.070 --> 06:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
protocols that were in place prior to
 
06:45:46.430 --> 06:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
last summer based on last some of last
 
06:45:46.440 --> 06:45:50.070 align:start position:0%
last summer based on last some of last
Summer's

06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:52.430 --> 06:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
incidents I'm sorry s i I missed the
 
06:45:53.948 --> 06:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
beginning of your question could you
 
06:45:55.990 --> 06:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
please repeat it sure I'm I'm just
 
06:45:58.310 --> 06:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if your department Revisited
 
06:46:00.430 --> 06:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
any of the protocols maybe change some
 
06:46:02.948 --> 06:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
of them uh in response to some of the
 
06:46:11.708 --> 06:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:15.190 --> 06:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
summer I I do not believe that uh our
 
06:46:17.628 --> 06:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
agency I I work for the lary police
 
06:46:19.270 --> 06:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
department and we are part of the
 
06:46:20.510 --> 06:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Special
 
06:46:24.110 --> 06:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
Operations unit and you know we have an
 
06:46:27.230 --> 06:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing you know sort of process where
 
06:46:30.350 --> 06:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
we are always uh critical of our own
 
06:46:32.590 --> 06:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
performance and try to do it you know
 
06:46:37.628 --> 06:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
better um all the time so we would have
 
06:46:39.670 --> 06:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
a normal uh
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh of any operation that we
 
06:46:44.670 --> 06:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
did um immediately following that
 
06:46:47.430 --> 06:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
operation and I can tell you i' I've
 
06:46:49.190 --> 06:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
been in law enforcement for over 22
 
06:46:52.750 --> 06:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
years and you know the number of no
 
06:46:56.388 --> 06:46:56.398 align:start position:0%
knock search warrants um that we've been
 
06:47:00.270 --> 06:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
involved in is certainly in in relation
 
06:47:04.350 --> 06:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
to all other warrants is very small um
 
06:47:06.270 --> 06:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
and they are only reserved you know
 
06:47:07.868 --> 06:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
really for the most
 
06:47:11.190 --> 06:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh search warrants where you
 
06:47:14.310 --> 06:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
know the safety of the officers or those
 
06:47:19.070 --> 06:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:22.320 --> 06:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:47:26.510 --> 06:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you
 
06:47:28.670 --> 06:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
recognized yeah I just have a quick
 
06:47:31.548 --> 06:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
question about who reviews the uh the uh
 
06:47:33.948 --> 06:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
evidence who reviews it when you're when
 
06:47:36.548 --> 06:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
you're it's a no knock for evidence did
 
06:47:38.548 --> 06:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
you say that they are all reviewed by a
 
06:47:41.430 --> 06:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
judge and is that in the
 
06:47:43.708 --> 06:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
law well in order to get a search
 
06:47:45.990 --> 06:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
warrant you would need the search
 
06:47:48.750 --> 06:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to be signed off by a judge and
 
06:47:52.190 --> 06:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
the no knock provision is a specific
 
06:47:54.830 --> 06:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
attachment to that warrant application
 
06:47:57.628 --> 06:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
you know there would need to be uh very
 
06:48:00.350 --> 06:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
specific uh facts and circumstances laid
 
06:48:03.310 --> 06:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
out as to why you would need that and
 
06:48:09.750 --> 06:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:12.110 --> 06:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
today represent new you have a followup
 
06:48:15.510 --> 06:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
question Roger just a quick one that I
 
06:48:17.350 --> 06:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
before just previously you said they
 
06:48:18.670 --> 06:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
don't do that I was wondering who the
 
06:48:20.910 --> 06:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
day was you mentioned uh justices of the
 
06:48:23.628 --> 06:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
pre peace Etc but what I'm hearing from
 
06:48:26.830 --> 06:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
you right now is that that it's it's
 
06:48:31.070 --> 06:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
always reviewed by a judge and is that
 
06:48:35.388 --> 06:48:35.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:43.030 --> 06:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:47.150 --> 06:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
you see seeing no hand hands raised I
 
06:48:50.708 --> 06:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
want to thank the Ser for his
 
06:49:11.868 --> 06:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:11.878 --> 06:49:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
Joseph

06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:22.110 --> 06:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
bber good afternoon members of the
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Ebert it's
 
06:49:27.468 --> 06:49:27.478 align:start position:0%
EBT I'm a captain with the New Hampshire
 
06:49:28.990 --> 06:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
State Police and I oversee our
 
06:49:30.548 --> 06:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services
 
06:49:33.708 --> 06:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh much like the speaker before
 
06:49:36.910 --> 06:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
me I I I think I I want to be respectful
 
06:49:39.510 --> 06:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
of your time and the other individuals
 
06:49:41.708 --> 06:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
who wish to testify almost all of the
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
points that I was going to address have
 
06:49:46.708 --> 06:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
been addressed and discussed um one
 
06:49:49.548 --> 06:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
thing I did want to say and this comes
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
from more of a a personal place but
 
06:49:56.868 --> 06:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
having worked on some of the cases that
 
06:49:59.310 --> 06:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
were mentioned previously uh the murder
 
06:50:01.230 --> 06:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
of Chief Michael Maloney the murder of
 
06:50:04.910 --> 06:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
Officer stepen arel I I take very very
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
very seriously as does by agency the
 
06:50:09.670 --> 06:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
review of any warrant service and there
 
06:50:13.110 --> 06:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
are a number of uh in within the state
 
06:50:14.990 --> 06:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
police there is a number of checks and
 
06:50:18.708 --> 06:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
balances and we try at all cost to avoid
 
06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
a no knock warant so I I know that uh uh
 
06:50:25.708 --> 06:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
much has been discussed about elsewhere
 
06:50:28.150 --> 06:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the the country and I understand that
 
06:50:29.990 --> 06:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I understand why that's being
 
06:50:32.830 --> 06:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
discussed but I wanted to make sure that
 
06:50:34.388 --> 06:50:34.398 align:start position:0%
the individuals of this committee and
 
06:50:37.110 --> 06:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who's listening to this uh uh to
 
06:50:40.468 --> 06:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
this broadcast knows that we always take
 
06:50:42.230 --> 06:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
the safety of the public and of course
 
06:50:44.350 --> 06:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
our our Troopers and anybody else and
 
06:50:45.868 --> 06:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
within law enforcement who are involved
 
06:50:48.270 --> 06:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
in a warrant service into account and we
 
06:50:51.868 --> 06:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
hold that as the absolute most Paramount
 
06:50:56.070 --> 06:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
of uh of outcomes so having said that I
 
06:50:57.830 --> 06:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
am absolutely willing to take any
 
06:51:01.350 --> 06:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:06.270 --> 06:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:11.430 --> 06:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:14.430 --> 06:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
not your hand your hand was a a digital
 
06:51:19.110 --> 06:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:21.990 --> 06:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
phical seeing no questions I want to I
 
06:51:24.230 --> 06:51:24.240 align:start position:0%

me yes I can yes I can hear you thank
 
06:52:08.270 --> 06:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon uh former rep Jr hle
 
06:52:11.030 --> 06:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
dun Barton speaking on behalf of
 
06:52:13.788 --> 06:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
myself I signed in an opposition to this
 
06:52:15.990 --> 06:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the reason I signed in an
 
06:52:18.150 --> 06:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill is a is a tragic
 
06:52:20.430 --> 06:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
story that I heard several years ago
 
06:52:23.150 --> 06:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
about Berwin Heights Maryland and I want
 
06:52:24.868 --> 06:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
to repeat this testimony of what
 
06:52:27.430 --> 06:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
happened in Berwin Heights Maryland so
 
06:52:29.388 --> 06:52:29.398 align:start position:0%
that we understand the
 
06:52:32.510 --> 06:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
consequences of a noock warrant executed
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
poorly we've heard a lot of testimony
 
06:52:35.948 --> 06:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
today that there's a lot of checks and
 
06:52:39.150 --> 06:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
balances about executing noock warrants
 
06:52:41.670 --> 06:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire differently and that's
 
06:52:45.230 --> 06:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
great but can we be better and in Berwin
 
06:52:49.310 --> 06:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
Heights Maryland in 2007 sorry 2008
 
06:52:52.150 --> 06:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
there was a raid on the mayor's house
 
06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
because they believe believe that a
 
06:52:55.510 --> 06:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
package of marijuana was to be delivered
 
06:52:58.750 --> 06:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
to the mayor's house and in the process
 
06:53:00.070 --> 06:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
they held the mayor and his
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law hostage and shot their two
 
06:53:08.270 --> 06:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
dogs Google barwin Heights Maryland it's
 
06:53:10.510 --> 06:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
worth reading the story heard this
 
06:53:12.430 --> 06:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
person speak in person once and it was
 
06:53:14.910 --> 06:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
very eye openening to feel to hear his
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
side of the story on a no knock raid
 
06:53:17.280 --> 06:53:18.868 align:start position:0%
side of the story on a no knock raid
conducted

06:53:18.868 --> 06:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
06:53:21.270 --> 06:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
poorly I understand that New Hampshire
 
06:53:22.910 --> 06:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it just to preserve of
 
06:53:24.150 --> 06:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
evidence that's what we've heard in
 
06:53:27.590 --> 06:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
testimony but I am very concerned that
 
06:53:31.230 --> 06:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have yet the perfect solution
 
06:53:33.910 --> 06:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
of trying to protect the individuals
 
06:53:35.350 --> 06:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
that are in the apartment or in the
 
06:53:38.110 --> 06:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
house protect the officers who are
 
06:53:41.670 --> 06:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
conducting um this warrant and I think
 
06:53:44.110 --> 06:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
um representative silver hit it the nail
 
06:53:46.110 --> 06:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
on the head that maybe having the judge
 
06:53:49.070 --> 06:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
do more in terms of signing off on the
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
authority of a no knock warrant is is
 
06:53:53.070 --> 06:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps the next step in terms of
 
06:53:55.430 --> 06:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
improvement under the current
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
law as I said I signed in an opposition
 
06:54:01.548 --> 06:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
because it only takes one bad no knock
 
06:54:04.548 --> 06:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
warrant where someone ends up dying and
 
06:54:07.708 --> 06:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
there's no way to recover the Injustice
 
06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
that happened so I would ask that you
 
06:54:11.350 --> 06:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
would make sure all the necessary checks
 
06:54:13.990 --> 06:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
and balances are in place as a committee
 
06:54:15.990 --> 06:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
um when you review what to do with this
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:21.680 --> 06:54:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:54:23.270 --> 06:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:54:26.110 --> 06:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Alexander I do
 
06:54:28.190 --> 06:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you Mr chair um
 
06:54:29.868 --> 06:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr hle for taking my
 
06:54:33.270 --> 06:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
question um you signed in in support of
 
06:54:35.150 --> 06:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
getting rid of no knock warrants correct
 
06:54:37.990 --> 06:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I was unclear by yes thank you
 
06:54:39.708 --> 06:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I did sign in
 
06:54:41.270 --> 06:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
in getting rid of no knock warrants
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
because I think there is the potential
 
06:54:48.070 --> 06:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
for a case where it's executed poorly
 
06:54:50.548 --> 06:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
and someone ends up at similar to The
 
06:54:53.310 --> 06:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
bwin Heights story where
 
06:54:55.430 --> 06:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's executed at the wrong house or for
 
06:54:58.310 --> 06:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
the wrong reason and if if I can just
 
06:54:59.628 --> 06:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
for those who don't have the time to go
 
06:55:02.388 --> 06:55:02.398 align:start position:0%
look this up this was where the
 
06:55:05.270 --> 06:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
intendent UPS driver I as I understand
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
it was the intended recipient of of this
 
06:55:10.510 --> 06:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
package of of marijuana but they didn't
 
06:55:12.190 --> 06:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
realize that so they had a different
 
06:55:15.270 --> 06:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
officer actually deliver the package and
 
06:55:16.788 --> 06:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
then they conducted the raid on the
 
06:55:19.670 --> 06:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
house and they held his mother-in-law
 
06:55:21.110 --> 06:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
hostage while he was getting out of the
 
06:55:23.830 --> 06:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
shower it was a mess so I I would just
 
06:55:26.110 --> 06:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
ask that we make sure we have every
 
06:55:27.990 --> 06:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
check and balance in place before we
 
06:55:31.310 --> 06:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.190 --> 06:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
warrants and for the record sometimes
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
politics makes funny bed U funny allies
 
06:55:39.030 --> 06:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
in this case if I look at the sponsors
 
06:55:40.708 --> 06:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
they tend to not be on the issues that I
 
06:55:43.110 --> 06:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
share but this is one where I think
 
06:55:49.150 --> 06:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:53.788 --> 06:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
stake repres Marston thank you Mr ch
 
06:55:56.670 --> 06:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for tting my question Mr H
 
06:55:58.510 --> 06:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
just a quick question in the regards
 
06:56:01.030 --> 06:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
that if what you say is true then we
 
06:56:03.110 --> 06:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
would all be living in a perfect world
 
06:56:04.590 --> 06:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
would we
 
06:56:06.990 --> 06:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
not thank you Mr Maron that's a good
 
06:56:08.948 --> 06:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
question yes we are far from a part
 
06:56:11.788 --> 06:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
perfect world and I I I honestly think
 
06:56:13.388 --> 06:56:13.398 align:start position:0%
that those that are conducting these
 
06:56:15.548 --> 06:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
warrants um and these searches are doing
 
06:56:17.708 --> 06:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
their best I'm not saying they're not
 
06:56:20.510 --> 06:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is we we as a continual
 
06:56:22.070 --> 06:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
improvement process should always be
 
06:56:24.430 --> 06:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
looking to see if we can make it better
 
06:56:25.750 --> 06:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I think the committee has an
 
06:56:43.750 --> 06:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:47.310 --> 06:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
that see seeing No Hands

06:58:32.830 --> 06:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
will we close the

Muse chman we had uh for HP 507 we had

62 people signed in in support we had uh
 
06:58:56.110 --> 06:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
seven signed in in opposition and we had
 
06:59:03.150 --> 06:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:05.270 --> 06:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
neutral ruse can you repeat those

[Music]
 
06:59:21.868 --> 06:59:21.878 align:start position:0%
neutral uh I see I do see a person
 
06:59:23.310 --> 06:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
member of the the public with their hand
 
06:59:25.430 --> 06:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
raised just to
 
06:59:28.190 --> 06:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
explain that uh once once a member of
 
06:59:29.788 --> 06:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
the public testifies that they they're
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
not to testify more than once that's why
 
06:59:38.468 --> 06:59:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
time I think what we what we're going to
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
do just be take a 10 minute break I
 
06:59:44.830 --> 06:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
think we can open up
 
06:59:49.070 --> 06:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:51.110 --> 06:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
interrup I think what we'll do is there
 
06:59:54.110 --> 06:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
we then um some executive sessions we do
 
06:59:55.750 --> 06:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
have some more bills to EXA why don't we
 
06:59:58.590 --> 06:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
take a 10 minute 10 minute breather
 
07:00:00.350 --> 07:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be in recess for 10 minutes and

second represent H do you wish to speak
 
07:19:11.150 --> 07:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
on your motion basically it's almost
 
07:19:14.190 --> 07:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
like the uh Bill we EXA earlier there
 
07:19:15.830 --> 07:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
07:19:19.070 --> 07:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
um a lot of issues with no knock WS
 
07:19:21.230 --> 07:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
around the country but
 
07:19:25.110 --> 07:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's it do it seems like they're used uh
 
07:19:26.868 --> 07:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
very judiciously
 
07:19:30.150 --> 07:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
and we didn't really hear a lot of test
 
07:19:32.110 --> 07:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
testimony about how bad they are in the
 
07:19:34.230 --> 07:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
man so it seems like
 
07:19:39.310 --> 07:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
a a fix of a problem that isn't doesn't
 
07:19:41.868 --> 07:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
exist thank
 
07:19:45.948 --> 07:19:45.958 align:start position:0%

07:19:49.360 --> 07:19:55.430 align:start position:0%
discussion D wish to

07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:57.910 --> 07:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
see no fur the hands raised call a
 
07:20:03.468 --> 07:20:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:07.868 --> 07:20:07.878 align:start position:0%
me represent tagas accept my apology
 
07:20:10.510 --> 07:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
certainly I just would like to speak on
 
07:20:13.548 --> 07:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
this bill and clear a couple things up
 
07:20:17.430 --> 07:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the Greenland shooting was a not a no
 
07:20:21.030 --> 07:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
knock warrant they had a warrant and
 
07:20:23.388 --> 07:20:23.398 align:start position:0%
they were going to knock but didn't get
 
07:20:27.110 --> 07:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
a chance to because a guy behind the
 
07:20:30.230 --> 07:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
door had a gun that he wasn't supposed
 
07:20:33.750 --> 07:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
to have his mother bought it for him he
 
07:20:37.510 --> 07:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
was bad from having it any guns at
 
07:20:40.468 --> 07:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
all and I think we need to stop and
 
07:20:43.788 --> 07:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
think about what we are doing with
 
07:20:43.798 --> 07:20:45.388 align:start position:0%
think about what we are doing with
police

07:20:45.388 --> 07:20:45.398 align:start position:0%
police
 
07:20:49.270 --> 07:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
officers as far as rules and regulations
 
07:20:51.388 --> 07:20:51.398 align:start position:0%
we put on them
 
07:20:54.110 --> 07:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
that we are not walking in their
 
07:20:56.948 --> 07:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
shoes and I feel as though this bill is
 
07:21:03.628 --> 07:21:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:03.638 --> 07:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

07:21:05.350 --> 07:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:21:09.830 --> 07:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:12.548 --> 07:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the reasons I asked one of
 
07:21:15.590 --> 07:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the officers about
 
07:21:18.670 --> 07:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
when when law enforcement agencies
 
07:21:21.388 --> 07:21:21.398 align:start position:0%
started doing no nor not warrants is
 
07:21:24.190 --> 07:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
because uh it literally seems to be
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
something that started um specifically
 
07:21:29.948 --> 07:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
with the war on drugs and I think one of
 
07:21:32.190 --> 07:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
the things that we've seen continuously
 
07:21:34.310 --> 07:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why these
 
07:21:36.548 --> 07:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
warrants are problematic across the
 
07:21:39.030 --> 07:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
country and uh and why we've heard so
 
07:21:41.670 --> 07:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
much about them is because people in
 
07:21:43.510 --> 07:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
minority communities tend to be
 
07:21:46.270 --> 07:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected by this type
 
07:21:47.670 --> 07:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
of law
 
07:21:53.350 --> 07:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:56.510 --> 07:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine what it must feel like
 
07:21:59.468 --> 07:21:59.478 align:start position:0%
sitting there watching your television
 
07:22:02.110 --> 07:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
not you know not having any idea what's
 
07:22:04.868 --> 07:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
going to happen next and then having uh
 
07:22:07.830 --> 07:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
police come through your door um and
 
07:22:10.468 --> 07:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
this has happened Time and Time and Time
 
07:22:12.590 --> 07:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
Again across the country it's happened
 
07:22:15.230 --> 07:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
in minority communities it's it's an
 
07:22:17.430 --> 07:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
element to policing that really seems to
 
07:22:20.868 --> 07:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
be new in the last 40 years
 
07:22:24.350 --> 07:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and I think it's one of it's a
 
07:22:27.190 --> 07:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
symptom of the militarization of our
 
07:22:29.788 --> 07:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
police force on another bill we actually
 
07:22:33.750 --> 07:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
heard an officer refer to uh bullets and
 
07:22:35.670 --> 07:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
tear gas as
 
07:22:37.628 --> 07:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
Munitions we're talking about law
 
07:22:40.628 --> 07:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement and civilians here and you
 
07:22:43.030 --> 07:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
know to me this bill is an opportunity
 
07:22:46.830 --> 07:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
to ramp this back down a little bit um
 
07:22:50.388 --> 07:22:50.398 align:start position:0%
to force us to consider Maybe some
 
07:22:54.948 --> 07:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
different ways to enforce the law um uh
 
07:23:18.308 --> 07:23:18.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:23.510 --> 07:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:28.468 --> 07:23:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:33.030 --> 07:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
Mr I want toate that the issue with no
 
07:23:33.040 --> 07:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
Mr I want toate that the issue with no
not

07:23:34.070 --> 07:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:23:37.788 --> 07:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
warrant the issue with no not war is not
 
07:23:41.510 --> 07:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're a useful tool a
 
07:23:45.230 --> 07:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
chainsaw is a useful tool but if I let
 
07:23:48.990 --> 07:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
my husband have one something bad could
 
07:23:49.000 --> 07:23:50.750 align:start position:0%
my husband have one something bad could
happen

07:23:50.750 --> 07:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:23:52.430 --> 07:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's also why my husband doesn't have
 
07:23:54.308 --> 07:23:54.318 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle
 
07:23:58.510 --> 07:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:02.548 --> 07:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
got listen representative hoer please
 
07:24:04.670 --> 07:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
sheing a
 
07:24:08.430 --> 07:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
joke I am I'm making a joke but but I'm
 
07:24:11.590 --> 07:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
trying to convey a meaningful point
 
07:24:13.070 --> 07:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
which is that we heard a lot of
 
07:24:15.150 --> 07:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
testimony today that is an important
 
07:24:18.590 --> 07:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
tool to affect a certain outcome and I'm
 
07:24:21.030 --> 07:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
sure that that's true that this is a
 
07:24:23.830 --> 07:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
useful tool given the outcome but tools
 
07:24:26.350 --> 07:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
can be dangerous as is the case with
 
07:24:30.270 --> 07:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
chainsaws which terrify me and I think
 
07:24:32.868 --> 07:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
that we found pretty
 
07:24:36.430 --> 07:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
consistently that the difference that's
 
07:24:39.388 --> 07:24:39.398 align:start position:0%
created when you announ then knock or
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
knock and then immediately announ which
 
07:24:43.708 --> 07:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
is the difference created by this SP
 
07:24:45.388 --> 07:24:45.398 align:start position:0%
highlighted by this
 
07:24:47.868 --> 07:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
bill that's where the danger lies
 
07:24:50.948 --> 07:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
because if they KN and
 
07:24:54.190 --> 07:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
announ the people inside in the timean
 
07:24:56.350 --> 07:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
between the knock and announ may feel
 
07:25:00.788 --> 07:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
justified in uh attacking whatever they
 
07:25:03.590 --> 07:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
perceive to be happening and then later
 
07:25:05.628 --> 07:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
as we saw in the case with the man in
 
07:25:09.868 --> 07:25:09.878 align:start position:0%
Texas if they are charged with murder or
 
07:25:11.388 --> 07:25:11.398 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they end up doing to
 
07:25:13.270 --> 07:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
the police who had a warrant in every
 
07:25:16.270 --> 07:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
right to be there um they may be able to
 
07:25:18.270 --> 07:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
argue that they were acting in offense
 
07:25:19.548 --> 07:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know who was at
 
07:25:21.868 --> 07:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
their home home and so then we have an
 
07:25:25.150 --> 07:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
injury or a dead person and then we
 
07:25:29.948 --> 07:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
don't have any justice for the affected
 
07:25:32.830 --> 07:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
person for the family who lost them and
 
07:25:34.708 --> 07:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
the person who made a bad
 
07:25:40.868 --> 07:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:44.670 --> 07:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
like um castle doctrine heavily
 
07:25:47.548 --> 07:25:47.558 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the way that no function
 
07:25:50.628 --> 07:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I'm not speaking to
 
07:25:51.948 --> 07:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
other states
 
07:25:54.270 --> 07:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Taylor or any of those
 
07:25:57.868 --> 07:25:57.878 align:start position:0%
situations because our c is way that our
 
07:26:00.548 --> 07:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
state phes it we have our own practices
 
07:26:03.070 --> 07:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
in our state and there just seems to be
 
07:26:04.990 --> 07:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
an essential conflict between those two
 
07:26:07.308 --> 07:26:07.318 align:start position:0%
concepts that you have a right to defend
 
07:26:10.190 --> 07:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
your property when you perceive a threat
 
07:26:11.750 --> 07:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then if you perceive a threat but
 
07:26:13.270 --> 07:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
they actually have a right to be you
 
07:26:16.350 --> 07:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
don't know this and you attack them what
 
07:26:18.948 --> 07:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
happen who is at fault who's responsible
 
07:26:21.910 --> 07:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the situation will anyone be held
 
07:26:23.468 --> 07:26:23.478 align:start position:0%
accountable if there's a loss of life or
 
07:26:26.670 --> 07:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
an injury or are people who attack
 
07:26:29.388 --> 07:26:29.398 align:start position:0%
police always going to be L free because
 
07:26:30.910 --> 07:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
they can claim that they thought they
 
07:26:33.150 --> 07:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
acting in their own self-defense so I
 
07:26:35.590 --> 07:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's really the issue here
 
07:26:39.190 --> 07:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
um and it's not what is not issue is
 
07:26:41.510 --> 07:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
whether no not warrants are an effective
 
07:26:46.308 --> 07:26:46.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:48.708 --> 07:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
07:26:52.070 --> 07:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
Welsh I think what we heard today in the
 
07:26:54.510 --> 07:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm just guessing it might
 
07:26:58.308 --> 07:26:58.318 align:start position:0%
have been let say a dozen incidents
 
07:27:00.030 --> 07:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
where things went
 
07:27:04.308 --> 07:27:04.318 align:start position:0%
wrong nobody testified as to how often
 
07:27:04.318 --> 07:27:05.230 align:start position:0%
wrong nobody testified as to how often
it's

07:27:05.230 --> 07:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:27:07.670 --> 07:27:07.680 align:start position:0%

Amendment and the amendment has been
 
07:31:23.830 --> 07:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:26.308 --> 07:31:26.318 align:start position:0%
everybody what's the amendment number
 
07:31:28.670 --> 07:31:28.680 align:start position:0%

you wish to speak to your Amendment yes
 
07:31:56.510 --> 07:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
I would thank you Mr chair uh the reason
 
07:31:59.190 --> 07:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we had the amendment drawn up was
 
07:32:00.750 --> 07:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
because when we heard testimony on
 
07:32:03.070 --> 07:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
Friday there seemed to be a lot of
 
07:32:05.750 --> 07:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern and some confusion about the
 
07:32:08.548 --> 07:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
definition of riot in New Hampshire and
 
07:32:10.990 --> 07:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
after hearing the testimony we thought
 
07:32:13.910 --> 07:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
it was best to just strike that from the
 
07:32:16.548 --> 07:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
bill Al together because it did
 
07:32:20.070 --> 07:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
not it did not justify I'm sorry did
 
07:32:23.110 --> 07:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
not undermine the
 
07:32:32.910 --> 07:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:36.030 --> 07:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
out will anyone wish to speak uh about
 
07:32:39.150 --> 07:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
the motion open it for discussion excuse
 
07:32:45.150 --> 07:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:49.350 --> 07:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
amendment just representative Maron I'm
 
07:32:51.230 --> 07:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
B it I guess and I'm not sure if that's
 
07:32:53.868 --> 07:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
the right word
 
07:32:56.430 --> 07:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
question wasn't that in the original
 
07:32:58.708 --> 07:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
Bill itself
 
07:33:02.788 --> 07:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
197 yes the amendment the original Bill
 
07:33:06.868 --> 07:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
had also added a section A subsection uh
 
07:33:10.468 --> 07:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
e uh the amendment strikes to subsection
 
07:33:13.230 --> 07:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
e and any reference to riting has been
 
07:33:13.240 --> 07:33:16.350 align:start position:0%
e and any reference to riting has been
removed

07:33:16.350 --> 07:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:23.150 --> 07:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:25.750 --> 07:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
the what I have here for the
 
07:33:29.948 --> 07:33:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:33.868 --> 07:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
02498 looks to me like d is is worded
 
07:33:36.590 --> 07:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
just exactly like what it is in the bill
 
07:33:39.308 --> 07:33:39.318 align:start position:0%
correct but in the original Bill there
 
07:33:44.510 --> 07:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
was a after d was e e is now gone by
 
07:33:46.628 --> 07:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
it's by the EV it's
 
07:33:50.270 --> 07:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
removed again point of water it's do
 
07:33:52.308 --> 07:33:52.318 align:start position:0%
state in the amendment that we
 
07:33:55.388 --> 07:33:55.398 align:start position:0%
eliminate well it's not a point of order
 
07:33:57.510 --> 07:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's a question about the amendment okay
 
07:33:59.910 --> 07:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
and we can open up for discussion so
 
07:34:04.110 --> 07:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
this is not we can discuss the
 
07:34:08.150 --> 07:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
so the original Bill had a subsection e
 
07:34:11.030 --> 07:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
under which the amendment would be
 
07:34:13.628 --> 07:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
removing that subsection the bill would
 
07:34:16.070 --> 07:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
have added subsection e subsection e
 
07:34:18.830 --> 07:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
does not exist in the law today if you
 
07:34:22.150 --> 07:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
adop the amendment and pass the Bill
 
07:34:23.868 --> 07:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
subsection e would still not exist in
 
07:34:27.110 --> 07:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
the law and that section was was
 
07:34:28.788 --> 07:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
designated and address and use the
 
07:34:34.868 --> 07:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
terminology RI and and I believe that
 
07:34:36.830 --> 07:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
the motivation behind the amendment was
 
07:34:39.070 --> 07:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
influenced by the testimony before the
 
07:34:39.080 --> 07:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
influenced by the testimony before the
committee

07:34:41.350 --> 07:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:34:44.868 --> 07:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
where it's very easy to confuse a
 
07:34:46.670 --> 07:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
peaceful Gathering where you can have a
 
07:34:49.590 --> 07:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
100 people peacefully Gathering
 
07:34:51.590 --> 07:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and out of those 100 people you can have
 
07:34:53.948 --> 07:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
one person with the you know air horn
 
07:34:57.430 --> 07:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
and out of those other one person can
 
07:34:59.628 --> 07:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
exercise extremely po judgment and throw
 
07:35:03.230 --> 07:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
a rock at someone's car or whatever and
 
07:35:05.070 --> 07:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
that would justify deadly force not only
 
07:35:06.990 --> 07:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
against the person that used the the
 
07:35:08.468 --> 07:35:08.478 align:start position:0%
through the rock but also the person
 
07:35:09.388 --> 07:35:09.398 align:start position:0%
with the
 
07:35:12.350 --> 07:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
air and that that to me was very
 
07:35:15.030 --> 07:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
persuasive testimony that it was an
 
07:35:16.868 --> 07:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
unattended consequence of the original
 
07:35:19.948 --> 07:35:19.958 align:start position:0%
bill this amendment resolv olves that
 
07:35:22.590 --> 07:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
issue and I think especially for the
 
07:35:25.430 --> 07:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
people who are peacefully protesting and
 
07:35:27.788 --> 07:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's their objective I can see
 
07:35:30.430 --> 07:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
why they can find it very concerning
 
07:35:32.750 --> 07:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
especially if you have two three th000
 
07:35:36.468 --> 07:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
people at your event and is one or two
 
07:35:39.350 --> 07:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
individuals that decide to engage in
 
07:35:39.360 --> 07:35:40.270 align:start position:0%
individuals that decide to engage in
violent

07:35:40.270 --> 07:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
violent
 
07:35:42.708 --> 07:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
Behavior it shouldn't because the the
 
07:35:43.830 --> 07:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
riting definition has the work
 
07:35:45.788 --> 07:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
tumultuous and that was the problem and
 
07:35:47.270 --> 07:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
that has to do with specifically the
 
07:35:49.350 --> 07:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's definition of riting it
 
07:35:51.388 --> 07:35:51.398 align:start position:0%
wasn't that the definition other states
 
07:35:53.990 --> 07:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
might have other definitions but I
 
07:35:56.430 --> 07:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
think having the word comm in there made
 
07:35:56.440 --> 07:35:57.468 align:start position:0%
think having the word comm in there made
it

07:35:57.468 --> 07:35:57.478 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:35:59.948 --> 07:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
really difficult to allow that snare
 
07:36:01.468 --> 07:36:01.478 align:start position:0%
because that fact kind could have played
 
07:36:02.788 --> 07:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
out and that would be unfortunate
 
07:36:06.030 --> 07:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
because if that did play out the person
 
07:36:08.548 --> 07:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
inside the vehicle would actually be
 
07:36:11.350 --> 07:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
legally justified in using the force
 
07:36:12.788 --> 07:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
when I say Justified it's because the
 
07:36:15.868 --> 07:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
law allows it but that's why we are felt
 
07:36:20.270 --> 07:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that was not we is the amendment is
 
07:36:22.070 --> 07:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
not believ that's an we don't believe
 
07:36:23.548 --> 07:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
that's an acceptable use of force and
 
07:36:25.030 --> 07:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed under the law
 
07:36:26.750 --> 07:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
under that circumstance because someone
 
07:36:28.868 --> 07:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
who's not intended to be violent or
 
07:36:30.430 --> 07:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
intimidate someone could very easily be
 
07:36:32.308 --> 07:36:32.318 align:start position:0%
drawn into it
 
07:36:35.230 --> 07:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
inadvertently no fa of their
 
07:36:37.070 --> 07:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
own that's what the that's what the
 
07:36:39.708 --> 07:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses which I I felt was a
 
07:36:39.718 --> 07:36:41.628 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses which I I felt was a
very

07:36:41.628 --> 07:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
very
 
07:36:44.270 --> 07:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
important issue I think it's very
 
07:36:47.788 --> 07:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
important that we address that I'm glad
 
07:36:47.798 --> 07:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
important that we address that I'm glad
these

07:36:53.830 --> 07:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:57.548 --> 07:36:57.558 align:start position:0%
represent represent Mar yeah thank you
 
07:36:57.558 --> 07:36:59.628 align:start position:0%
represent represent Mar yeah thank you
Mr

07:36:59.628 --> 07:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
07:37:03.548 --> 07:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
chairman my my being naive maybe
 
07:37:06.910 --> 07:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
or but I've seen amendments before and
 
07:37:08.510 --> 07:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
when they come
 
07:37:11.948 --> 07:37:11.958 align:start position:0%
through if in this case they would have
 
07:37:14.110 --> 07:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
stated that we are crossing
 
07:37:18.110 --> 07:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
out that line six of the bill which is e
 
07:37:21.670 --> 07:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
and all of that up until B of effective
 
07:37:24.628 --> 07:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
date this amendment doesn't state that
 
07:37:29.110 --> 07:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the way I read it okay you put in D
 
07:37:31.868 --> 07:37:31.878 align:start position:0%
which is the same as what's there and is
 
07:37:34.628 --> 07:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
still there but section e is not the
 
07:37:37.708 --> 07:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
current law the bill was making section
 
07:37:42.990 --> 07:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
e or trying to make section e the law so
 
07:37:45.910 --> 07:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
by amending the bill and taking out
 
07:37:47.670 --> 07:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
section e section e already doesn't
 
07:37:52.548 --> 07:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:54.468 --> 07:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
but you're not taking it out the bill
 
07:37:58.708 --> 07:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:06.030 --> 07:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:08.510 --> 07:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
said taking out
 
07:38:11.230 --> 07:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
four I got it now thank you I will tell
 
07:38:12.628 --> 07:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
you this if the amendment fails the
 
07:38:14.230 --> 07:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
chair would not be supporting the bill
 
07:38:16.270 --> 07:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
as as the original
 
07:38:20.430 --> 07:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
Bill correct so that's that's that's
 
07:38:22.430 --> 07:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
where I I my head is at I feel very
 
07:38:25.430 --> 07:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
strongly about that it was well point if
 
07:38:27.910 --> 07:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
I may speak was well pointed out to me
 
07:38:38.430 --> 07:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:40.750 --> 07:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
G representative board
 
07:38:45.230 --> 07:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
name thank you Mr chairman I will be uh
 
07:38:48.070 --> 07:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment uh is an
 
07:38:50.590 --> 07:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
improvement of a very bad Bill that is
 
07:38:50.600 --> 07:38:51.670 align:start position:0%
improvement of a very bad Bill that is
completely

07:38:51.670 --> 07:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
completely
 
07:38:55.070 --> 07:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but I cannot support I do
 
07:38:57.708 --> 07:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
not want the bill to go forward without
 
07:39:04.350 --> 07:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:09.750 --> 07:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:12.990 --> 07:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
Muse you Mr chairman one of the concerns
 
07:39:15.788 --> 07:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
that I have about um about the amendment
 
07:39:19.788 --> 07:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
itself is what it appears to do is to to
 
07:39:23.270 --> 07:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
take a bill which at least in some way
 
07:39:27.510 --> 07:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh tried to draw some limits around this
 
07:39:29.070 --> 07:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it
 
07:39:33.430 --> 07:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
actually creates almost no limits at all
 
07:39:36.350 --> 07:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
um so we've been spending a lot of time
 
07:39:38.510 --> 07:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
talking about protests but much more
 
07:39:40.670 --> 07:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
common in this state are incidents of
 
07:39:43.990 --> 07:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
road rage and uh one of the things that
 
07:39:46.868 --> 07:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I'm very concerned about is
 
07:39:49.150 --> 07:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
that you know an active
 
07:39:50.868 --> 07:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
simple assault combined with a little
 
07:39:51.750 --> 07:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
07:39:55.190 --> 07:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
stupidity uh could increasingly become
 
07:39:57.510 --> 07:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know an action that gets people
 
07:40:01.948 --> 07:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
killed um and with this law it would
 
07:40:04.830 --> 07:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
make it lawful in some of these cases to
 
07:40:10.510 --> 07:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
do that so I'm just questioning the the
 
07:40:13.590 --> 07:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
um whether whether passing something
 
07:40:17.510 --> 07:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:17.520 --> 07:40:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
judgment

07:40:25.430 --> 07:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:27.190 --> 07:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
I I will
 
07:40:27.200 --> 07:40:28.990 align:start position:0%
I I will
say

07:40:28.990 --> 07:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
07:40:31.548 --> 07:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
that eliminating the rioting section I
 
07:40:34.070 --> 07:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
know we were talking about protests and
 
07:40:36.788 --> 07:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
whatnot but that a lot of the testimony
 
07:40:39.590 --> 07:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
we heard really focused on that section
 
07:40:42.468 --> 07:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
of the bill the amendment does remove
 
07:40:45.430 --> 07:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that whether I would say and I would say
 
07:40:47.030 --> 07:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
this with a lot of confidence that even
 
07:40:50.350 --> 07:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
if you don't support the amendment as
 
07:40:54.388 --> 07:40:54.398 align:start position:0%
pass I still the original draft of the
 
07:40:58.510 --> 07:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh is to me unacceptable I think in
 
07:41:00.948 --> 07:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
this case and it was said by we we'll
 
07:41:02.750 --> 07:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment once it's adopted
 
07:41:06.388 --> 07:41:06.398 align:start position:0%
but I think if it's adopted but then
 
07:41:09.070 --> 07:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss the underline merits of
 
07:41:11.750 --> 07:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
remaining representative
 
07:41:14.190 --> 07:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman I will just
 
07:41:17.270 --> 07:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
Echo rep representative Muse's uh
 
07:41:19.990 --> 07:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
objection to the amendment in the Bill
 
07:41:29.270 --> 07:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:31.910 --> 07:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle and that thank you represent and
 
07:41:33.788 --> 07:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
just to point out that that language
 
07:41:36.070 --> 07:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
about vehicle was in the original bill
 
07:41:38.150 --> 07:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's survives with the
 
07:41:41.750 --> 07:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so we can debate that what I'm
 
07:41:44.030 --> 07:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
saying is after after the
 
07:41:46.628 --> 07:41:46.638 align:start position:0%

here saying that I'm extremely Disturbed
 
07:44:34.990 --> 07:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
at what I'm seeing happening when we
 
07:44:39.670 --> 07:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
have the voices of our people sign in in
 
07:44:43.628 --> 07:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
such great opposition yet we are not
 
07:44:47.430 --> 07:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
going to represent that I don't
 
07:44:48.830 --> 07:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
understand who we really trying to
 
07:44:51.070 --> 07:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
protect here and who we're really
 
07:44:56.190 --> 07:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
listening to in terms of uh fairness and
 
07:44:57.708 --> 07:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
that's all I'll have to say on that I
 
07:45:01.910 --> 07:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:04.308 --> 07:45:04.318 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
07:45:06.510 --> 07:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
board thank you Mr
 
07:45:09.990 --> 07:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be voting against this a
 
07:45:13.628 --> 07:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended all the testimony we
 
07:45:18.670 --> 07:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
heard on this bill uh justifying it are
 
07:45:21.590 --> 07:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
covered in in Sub in paragraphs a b and
 
07:45:26.868 --> 07:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
c d was not uh something that anybody
 
07:45:29.910 --> 07:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
brought up examples that there was a
 
07:45:35.628 --> 07:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
need and in fact if I had my brothers I
 
07:45:42.990 --> 07:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
would repeal paragraph d as being Uh
 
07:45:46.670 --> 07:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
u a little extreme because it says
 
07:45:51.628 --> 07:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to use deadly force to
 
07:45:51.638 --> 07:45:54.110 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to use deadly force to
commit

07:45:54.110 --> 07:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
commit
 
07:45:58.308 --> 07:45:58.318 align:start position:0%
uh prevent unlawful Force for a
 
07:46:02.230 --> 07:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
commission of a felony well as we asked
 
07:46:04.070 --> 07:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
the uh people that were sponsoring this
 
07:46:08.830 --> 07:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill about what is unlawful uh
 
07:46:12.150 --> 07:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
Force um none of them really give me a
 
07:46:16.750 --> 07:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
definition but we do know that
 
07:46:18.868 --> 07:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
07:46:23.350 --> 07:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
deadly force well it is but we also know
 
07:46:27.510 --> 07:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
that battery is unlawful force and
 
07:46:30.468 --> 07:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
battery is should not be a reason for
 
07:46:33.190 --> 07:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
someone to die
 
07:46:36.910 --> 07:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
um so if I have my brothers I would
 
07:46:41.030 --> 07:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
repeal paragraph D from the from the
 
07:46:43.788 --> 07:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
statues completely but I certainly would
 
07:46:46.910 --> 07:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
not extend it today thank
 
07:46:46.920 --> 07:46:53.230 align:start position:0%
not extend it today thank
you

07:46:53.230 --> 07:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:55.030 --> 07:46:55.040 align:start position:0%

second oh stage makeing a point of
 
07:47:11.440 --> 07:47:16.910 align:start position:0%

07:47:21.548 --> 07:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
board is
 
07:47:23.750 --> 07:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
recognized have we gone through the
 
07:47:29.590 --> 07:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:31.670 --> 07:47:31.680 align:start position:0%

07:47:41.548 --> 07:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
haven't have
 
07:47:44.510 --> 07:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
not we're discussing the underly bill
 
07:47:46.948 --> 07:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
got all right can't be talking about
 
07:47:48.948 --> 07:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
something without a motion
 
07:47:50.708 --> 07:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
we just were
 
07:47:52.708 --> 07:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
yeah representative BRS you are
 
07:47:56.110 --> 07:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
recognized for a motion Mr chairman I
 
07:47:58.548 --> 07:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
make a motion of ought to pass with
 
07:48:00.548 --> 07:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment for House Bill
 
07:48:09.628 --> 07:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:12.750 --> 07:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
second thank you for pointing out that
 
07:48:15.308 --> 07:48:15.318 align:start position:0%
but you didn't say point of order this
 
07:48:19.510 --> 07:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
time that was anyway makes
 
07:48:22.030 --> 07:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
07:48:22.040 --> 07:48:23.830 align:start position:0%
back to the
discussion

07:48:23.830 --> 07:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
07:48:26.708 --> 07:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
so I understand there was a lot of
 
07:48:29.548 --> 07:48:29.558 align:start position:0%
testimony I I just want to say I respect
 
07:48:33.750 --> 07:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
to disagree I think the the voices were
 
07:48:33.760 --> 07:48:34.788 align:start position:0%
to disagree I think the the voices were
Listen

07:48:34.788 --> 07:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
Listen
 
07:48:38.750 --> 07:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
to I heard a lot of testimony about a
 
07:48:40.788 --> 07:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
lot the majority of it overwhelmingly
 
07:48:43.510 --> 07:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
addressed when was uh folks on the
 
07:48:43.520 --> 07:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
addressed when was uh folks on the
writing

07:48:45.030 --> 07:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
writing
 
07:48:49.070 --> 07:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
language and I will be honest going into
 
07:48:53.030 --> 07:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the hearing I was uh in favor of
 
07:48:56.030 --> 07:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
passing the bill as it was drafted and I
 
07:48:57.670 --> 07:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
changed my
 
07:49:02.388 --> 07:49:02.398 align:start position:0%
my based on the testimony so I may not
 
07:49:04.030 --> 07:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
be adopting every
 
07:49:06.670 --> 07:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
every piece of policy that they that
 
07:49:10.468 --> 07:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
testimony from the public provided I was
 
07:49:13.468 --> 07:49:13.478 align:start position:0%
listed and and I think a lot of members
 
07:49:16.990 --> 07:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee were and that that's
 
07:49:19.110 --> 07:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
shows what but the amendment was
 
07:49:22.910 --> 07:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
supported and past so just to think that
 
07:49:24.910 --> 07:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
we weren't we were ignoring the public
 
07:49:26.548 --> 07:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
and I took that consider very serious
 
07:49:32.030 --> 07:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
like I see how that can be a problem
 
07:49:34.308 --> 07:49:34.318 align:start position:0%
especially given what's what's going on
 
07:49:37.628 --> 07:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
in society today it was not I I changed
 
07:49:41.510 --> 07:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
my mind so I listen I I I encourage
 
07:49:43.150 --> 07:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
people to come here and that's that's a
 
07:49:44.670 --> 07:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
good thing that people provided
 
07:49:49.110 --> 07:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
testimony the committee absorbed it and
 
07:49:50.868 --> 07:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
I think that that that's that's a
 
07:49:50.878 --> 07:49:51.948 align:start position:0%
I think that that that's that's a
positive

07:49:51.948 --> 07:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
positive
 
07:49:54.308 --> 07:49:54.318 align:start position:0%
outome may not be perfect for everyone
 
07:49:55.830 --> 07:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
not able to like everything about it but
 
07:49:56.628 --> 07:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
I think
 
07:49:59.548 --> 07:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
it's something to to
 
07:50:01.990 --> 07:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
recognize in regards to the use of force
 
07:50:03.230 --> 07:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
involving the
 
07:50:06.150 --> 07:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle so it's unlock force it can be
 
07:50:09.548 --> 07:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:12.750 --> 07:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
be most most uses of force involve some
 
07:50:14.190 --> 07:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
type of battery in one way or another
 
07:50:14.200 --> 07:50:16.628 align:start position:0%
type of battery in one way or another
it's

07:50:19.110 --> 07:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
just could be that too I don't know how
 
07:50:20.830 --> 07:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to be committing that in
 
07:50:22.308 --> 07:50:22.318 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony against the
 
07:50:22.318 --> 07:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony against the
vehicle

07:50:23.840 --> 07:50:23.850 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
07:50:23.850 --> 07:50:25.308 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
07:50:31.468 --> 07:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:34.468 --> 07:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
back I'm I'm use a different example but
 
07:50:36.788 --> 07:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying but it's
 
07:50:39.468 --> 07:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
it's the unlawful Force but also in the
 
07:50:43.110 --> 07:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
commission of a felony and it's against
 
07:50:45.830 --> 07:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
the person inside of you so it takes all
 
07:50:48.750 --> 07:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
those elements to come together so the
 
07:50:53.388 --> 07:50:53.398 align:start position:0%
unlawful Force alone will not give rise
 
07:50:55.430 --> 07:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
to someone being able to use deadly
 
07:50:59.308 --> 07:50:59.318 align:start position:0%
force and I believe it was it was Tes
 
07:51:01.510 --> 07:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
believe from Dr Hannon where he said if
 
07:51:03.110 --> 07:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to use this type of force
 
07:51:05.150 --> 07:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
inside of your
 
07:51:08.788 --> 07:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
home your car is it's still property and
 
07:51:11.350 --> 07:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're inside your car which is I know
 
07:51:13.150 --> 07:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's not your home but it's it's
 
07:51:16.548 --> 07:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
parallel that so I I I believe that's a
 
07:51:18.990 --> 07:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
good analogy to
 
07:51:23.948 --> 07:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:28.110 --> 07:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:32.110 --> 07:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
RV that now I'm not sure if it's an RV
 
07:51:34.708 --> 07:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
if that would consider your home that
 
07:51:34.718 --> 07:51:38.990 align:start position:0%
if that would consider your home that
may

07:51:38.990 --> 07:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:42.030 --> 07:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
bew but dwelling in is already on there
 
07:51:44.230 --> 07:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
as well so that's where you live you
 
07:51:48.590 --> 07:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
already be allowed to use what
 
07:51:50.750 --> 07:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
well that would also be your dwelling I
 
07:51:52.788 --> 07:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
suppose and you would already be allowed
 
07:51:56.270 --> 07:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
to use the deadly force if a lawful
 
07:51:56.280 --> 07:52:01.230 align:start position:0%
to use the deadly force if a lawful
force

07:52:01.230 --> 07:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:04.308 --> 07:52:04.318 align:start position:0%
was that's the way I look at it's not so
 
07:52:06.750 --> 07:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
simply the unlawful
 
07:52:09.510 --> 07:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
for representative Maron thank you Mr
 
07:52:11.350 --> 07:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't think what I'm going to
 
07:52:13.548 --> 07:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
ask is a point of order but
 
07:52:16.150 --> 07:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative Muse does a great job of
 
07:52:19.190 --> 07:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
giving us support and opposed and was
 
07:52:21.110 --> 07:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
that done on this bill at any time and
 
07:52:23.110 --> 07:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
could he give it to us
 
07:52:27.230 --> 07:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
now he most yes he he did he
 
07:52:30.110 --> 07:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
did uh he did do it I can have him do it
 
07:52:33.110 --> 07:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
again I will say that what again we took
 
07:52:34.910 --> 07:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
the biggest section out of the bill so I
 
07:52:37.388 --> 07:52:37.398 align:start position:0%
don't want to discredit the public vote
 
07:52:40.150 --> 07:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
on that now I'll allow represent M to
 
07:52:43.030 --> 07:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
read that to the committee again yeah
 
07:52:43.040 --> 07:52:44.430 align:start position:0%
read that to the committee again yeah
thank

07:52:44.430 --> 07:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:52:46.750 --> 07:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
you represent let's that representative
 
07:52:48.670 --> 07:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
Muse read that and then I'll acknowledge
 
07:52:51.190 --> 07:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
07:52:53.830 --> 07:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
Newman I'm sorry what what do you I'm
 
07:52:56.388 --> 07:52:56.398 align:start position:0%
not understanding what you want me to
 
07:52:59.030 --> 07:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
read uh representative Marson wants you
 
07:53:03.030 --> 07:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
to read the the the numbers for the
 
07:53:05.110 --> 07:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
people who from the public who were in
 
07:53:10.868 --> 07:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:14.270 --> 07:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
against so for HB 197 as originally
 
07:53:17.190 --> 07:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
written there were 79 people who signed
 
07:53:19.468 --> 07:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
in in support and
 
07:53:26.030 --> 07:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:28.948 --> 07:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
it Marson that that
 
07:53:31.590 --> 07:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
also explains some of the justification
 
07:53:33.388 --> 07:53:33.398 align:start position:0%
for the
 
07:53:35.708 --> 07:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
amendment represent
 
07:53:38.190 --> 07:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman I'll make
 
07:53:40.430 --> 07:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
note of the fact that I waited for
 
07:53:42.830 --> 07:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
recognition because I'm I want to raise
 
07:53:45.350 --> 07:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
a point of order but I'm unsure if it's
 
07:53:49.548 --> 07:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
valid um we took vote on an amendment
 
07:53:53.110 --> 07:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
without a motion being seconded and and
 
07:53:57.430 --> 07:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
my point of O order is is that V is that
 
07:54:01.150 --> 07:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
vote on that Amendment still valid or do
 
07:54:03.670 --> 07:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
we have to vote on it again well first
 
07:54:06.070 --> 07:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
of all the I will say it is a valid
 
07:54:09.868 --> 07:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
point of order so I will accept it as a
 
07:54:12.590 --> 07:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
valid point of order the point of
 
07:54:15.670 --> 07:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
order it wasn't it's not rais time we
 
07:54:18.430 --> 07:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
already the vote is ended but when the
 
07:54:21.070 --> 07:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
vote when the motion was made was ought
 
07:54:23.750 --> 07:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
to pass the introduce an amendment and
 
07:54:26.230 --> 07:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
that was seconded by representative WS
 
07:54:28.110 --> 07:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
then when I open up to the discussion I
 
07:54:29.910 --> 07:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe that is
 
07:54:33.030 --> 07:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
when I it was the chair's oversight of
 
07:54:36.670 --> 07:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
not recognizing representative roads to
 
07:54:39.150 --> 07:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
act a formal motion a to pass
 
07:54:42.590 --> 07:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
with so that the oversight was after the
 
07:54:44.670 --> 07:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
amendment was adopted that's my
 
07:54:48.308 --> 07:54:48.318 align:start position:0%
understanding so we do we do have a
 
07:54:50.190 --> 07:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
motion now now now that motion's been
 
07:54:53.230 --> 07:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
made and that was corrected by re that
 
07:54:54.830 --> 07:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
was well he didn't say point of order
 
07:54:57.990 --> 07:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
which was ironically out of order but at
 
07:54:59.788 --> 07:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
the same time he raised the point of
 
07:55:03.030 --> 07:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
order uh that's how I interpreted and it
 
07:55:07.510 --> 07:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:09.628 --> 07:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you Mr chair for the
 
07:55:11.708 --> 07:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
clarification I was just trying to make
 
07:55:16.190 --> 07:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:16.200 --> 07:55:25.628 align:start position:0%
 
correct

07:55:25.628 --> 07:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:29.350 --> 07:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
signal participating at home if if your
 
07:55:31.230 --> 07:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
if your digital hand is up I'm getting
 
07:55:32.990 --> 07:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
good enough at this that I actually can
 
07:55:35.510 --> 07:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
see it just make sure your hand is down
 
07:55:39.030 --> 07:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
if it's not just be conscious of see no
 
07:55:41.350 --> 07:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
further hands
 
07:55:44.750 --> 07:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
raised oh me representative G right yeah
 
07:55:47.270 --> 07:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know I never considered road rage so
 
07:55:49.628 --> 07:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
I have to thank um representative um
 
07:55:52.990 --> 07:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
Muse for bringing that to light and we
 
07:55:55.230 --> 07:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
all know that New Hampshire has a lot of
 
07:55:58.948 --> 07:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
road rage and I'm sorry you know I
 
07:56:01.350 --> 07:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
thought about this and I know I cannot
 
07:56:02.948 --> 07:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
vote for
 
07:56:05.590 --> 07:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
this because I don't think we have
 
07:56:08.230 --> 07:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
really thought about all the other
 
07:56:09.868 --> 07:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
consequences that could be a direct
 
07:56:16.070 --> 07:56:16.080 align:start position:0%

07:58:35.308 --> 07:58:35.318 align:start position:0%
Testament I've remained silent on this
 
07:58:37.388 --> 07:58:37.398 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
07:58:40.948 --> 07:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
U and what really bothers me is we're
 
07:58:44.430 --> 07:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
spending an awful lot of time
 
07:58:48.830 --> 07:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
fixing problems after they're a problem
 
07:58:52.670 --> 07:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the real problem is that for 50 60 years
 
07:58:56.910 --> 07:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't you know we have devastated
 
07:58:59.948 --> 07:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
our families with you know a a whole
 
07:59:03.030 --> 07:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
series of of laws education systems and
 
07:59:05.750 --> 07:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
so on and they cause problems like this
 
07:59:08.590 --> 07:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a problem of having to
 
07:59:10.708 --> 07:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
defend the home or having no knock
 
07:59:13.030 --> 07:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
warrants or things like that if we took
 
07:59:15.708 --> 07:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
care of our families and it just really
 
07:59:19.230 --> 07:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
upsets me that we we argue about these
 
07:59:22.030 --> 07:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of laws and we don't sit down with
 
07:59:25.070 --> 07:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
our families every night and have dinner

representes in between Bill I just want
 
08:02:59.190 --> 08:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
to let you know I received an email from
 
08:03:02.070 --> 08:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
a someone who I don't know personally
 
08:03:04.430 --> 08:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
they I made I complimented you last
 
08:03:06.308 --> 08:03:06.318 align:start position:0%
Friday about how helpful you work to the
 
08:03:08.150 --> 08:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee and the person thought I was
 
08:03:10.590 --> 08:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
not being sincere and I actually had my
 
08:03:12.070 --> 08:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
notes to address that because I was
 
08:03:12.080 --> 08:03:12.990 align:start position:0%
notes to address that because I was
being

08:03:12.990 --> 08:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
08:03:14.948 --> 08:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
sincere and
 
08:03:18.270 --> 08:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
uh I would B me being upset was that
 
08:03:19.788 --> 08:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
that when we compliment each other
 
08:03:21.350 --> 08:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
people don't think think we're actually
 
08:03:24.388 --> 08:03:24.398 align:start position:0%
complimenting each other so I just want
 
08:03:26.510 --> 08:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
to let you know that that was sincere
 
08:03:28.150 --> 08:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who interpreted that way
 
08:03:30.788 --> 08:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
what but it doesn't mean a lot because
 
08:03:33.070 --> 08:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
we've been uh struggling with technology
 
08:03:36.548 --> 08:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
and I think it's more difficult for it's
 
08:03:37.750 --> 08:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing an exceptional job
 
08:03:40.030 --> 08:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
especially if you're not in the room so
 
08:03:42.070 --> 08:03:42.080 align:start position:0%

uh yes uh Mr chairman I just have a
 
08:04:51.948 --> 08:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
quick question uh when representative
 
08:04:55.388 --> 08:04:55.398 align:start position:0%
Muse reads the numbers of opposed and
 
08:04:59.110 --> 08:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
and for a bill um could that possibly be
 
08:05:01.150 --> 08:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
done at the beginning of the executive
 
08:05:03.670 --> 08:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
session until after the vote instead of
 
08:05:06.270 --> 08:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
after the boote vote it's technically
 
08:05:07.750 --> 08:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done before I end the
 
08:05:09.868 --> 08:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
hearing I keep for some reason for the
 
08:05:12.590 --> 08:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
life of me keep forgetting and I don't
 
08:05:15.350 --> 08:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
understand why so representative m i
 
08:05:18.590 --> 08:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
just completely delegated that to him
 
08:05:22.308 --> 08:05:22.318 align:start position:0%
but he can't see me reaching for the the
 
08:05:22.318 --> 08:05:25.948 align:start position:0%
but he can't see me reaching for the the
orange

08:05:25.948 --> 08:05:25.958 align:start position:0%

this bill uh those uh amendments are
 
08:08:11.590 --> 08:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
very uh small and I think that they
 
08:08:19.430 --> 08:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:19.440 --> 08:08:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
representa

08:08:20.990 --> 08:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
representa
 
08:08:24.788 --> 08:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
well I still think this is a 28a issue
 
08:08:27.868 --> 08:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
we cannot mandate to the cities and
 
08:08:31.830 --> 08:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
towns things that we not will to
 
08:08:34.230 --> 08:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
pay that's why I think we should retain
 
08:08:37.830 --> 08:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
it and to investigate whether or not
 
08:08:44.910 --> 08:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:44.920 --> 08:08:47.388 align:start position:0%
 
it

08:08:47.388 --> 08:08:47.398 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:08:51.548 --> 08:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
uh representa bo thank you chairman and
 
08:08:53.670 --> 08:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is one of the reason the reason for
 
08:08:55.510 --> 08:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
one of the Amendments that I made was to
 
08:08:58.788 --> 08:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
change the language to uh May rather
 
08:09:01.110 --> 08:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
than shall which no longer makes it a
 
08:09:03.830 --> 08:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
mandate and that's all you really need
 
08:09:07.750 --> 08:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
to uh uh not make an a mandate but since
 
08:09:10.670 --> 08:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
that funding is still there uh we can
 
08:09:13.990 --> 08:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
test to see what how much money is
 
08:09:18.628 --> 08:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
available and where where uh how how a
 
08:09:21.270 --> 08:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
shortfall there would be for uh the
 
08:09:26.110 --> 08:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:28.230 --> 08:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
raised representative
 
08:09:33.070 --> 08:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
pakus yes thank you Mr chairman I second
 
08:09:35.948 --> 08:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
to retain it because we have so many
 
08:09:39.670 --> 08:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
bills in that are addressing this issue
 
08:09:43.308 --> 08:09:43.318 align:start position:0%
and I believe in the body cameras but I
 
08:09:46.388 --> 08:09:46.398 align:start position:0%
do not believe in ask in the city's
 
08:09:53.030 --> 08:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:56.750 --> 08:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:01.628 --> 08:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
Testament when you take the word sh out
 
08:10:03.388 --> 08:10:03.398 align:start position:0%
and I'm against the bill all together
 
08:10:05.948 --> 08:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
but you take the word shall out then you
 
08:10:07.468 --> 08:10:07.478 align:start position:0%
just might as well throw the whole bill
 
08:10:07.478 --> 08:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
just might as well throw the whole bill
out

08:10:09.030 --> 08:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
08:10:11.230 --> 08:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
because it it's
 
08:10:13.430 --> 08:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
meaningless if if you you're not going
 
08:10:14.830 --> 08:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
to bandaid
 
08:10:21.270 --> 08:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:24.590 --> 08:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
it representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
08:10:26.430 --> 08:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to add on to
 
08:10:28.030 --> 08:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative Welch's point that this
 
08:10:31.308 --> 08:10:31.318 align:start position:0%
is a uh downshifting of costs issue uh
 
08:10:33.350 --> 08:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill clearly should have had a fin
 
08:10:34.910 --> 08:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note attached to it and it
 
08:10:36.830 --> 08:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't so it's dead out of the gate
 
08:10:39.670 --> 08:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
just on that basis alone in my
 
08:10:41.708 --> 08:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you representative boss in
 
08:10:44.468 --> 08:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
respect to the fiscal note my
 
08:10:46.788 --> 08:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that there a house rules
 
08:10:48.868 --> 08:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
that would require fiscal note in
 
08:10:52.948 --> 08:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
addition to an RSA now I'm not I'm not
 
08:10:55.468 --> 08:10:55.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that happened here
 
08:10:56.868 --> 08:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
would there was
 
08:10:59.910 --> 08:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
none if I'm wrong with that
 
08:11:02.388 --> 08:11:02.398 align:start position:0%
it's but it's just not there so the
 
08:11:03.590 --> 08:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
other thing I
 
08:11:05.750 --> 08:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean we not it's one thing they have an
 
08:11:08.388 --> 08:11:08.398 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate which is violation of
 
08:11:12.708 --> 08:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
AR 28 I I think the body cameras don't
 
08:11:16.430 --> 08:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't bother me now it's actually a
 
08:11:18.670 --> 08:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
something that will help both law
 
08:11:21.510 --> 08:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and civilians but we need to
 
08:11:24.670 --> 08:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
one it' be nice to know how much it cost
 
08:11:27.030 --> 08:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
before you mandate two because the state
 
08:11:29.388 --> 08:11:29.398 align:start position:0%
needs to pay for it but we still need to
 
08:11:31.510 --> 08:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
know your cost this needs a lot of work
 
08:11:34.868 --> 08:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
I will say I haven't gone through I
 
08:11:37.430 --> 08:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
skimm through Senate Bill 96 but what I
 
08:11:40.190 --> 08:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
Envision is and representative Pak kind
 
08:11:42.388 --> 08:11:42.398 align:start position:0%
someone hinted alluded to
 
08:11:44.708 --> 08:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
this that hasn't passed in the Senate
 
08:11:46.468 --> 08:11:46.478 align:start position:0%
yet we don't don't know it's to make it
 
08:11:48.948 --> 08:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
out of there but if it does I get the
 
08:11:51.150 --> 08:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
feeling it would come to this committee
 
08:11:53.070 --> 08:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
we can kind of pick and choose the best
 
08:11:55.750 --> 08:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
of both worlds and work on it then
 
08:11:58.468 --> 08:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
considering that we have about well
 
08:12:00.110 --> 08:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
going into today we have still have
 
08:12:01.590 --> 08:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
about over 50 bills in committee we have
 
08:12:03.948 --> 08:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
to get out by March
 
08:12:07.510 --> 08:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
11 which is a bigger concern I have for
 
08:12:09.868 --> 08:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
this committee because they this this
 
08:12:11.628 --> 08:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
may be important but we may have bills
 
08:12:14.468 --> 08:12:14.478 align:start position:0%
that just don't get active on because we
 
08:12:15.830 --> 08:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the time and the resources
 
08:12:15.840 --> 08:12:18.070 align:start position:0%
don't have the time and the resources
actually

08:12:18.070 --> 08:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
08:12:21.750 --> 08:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
do that's why I I support the motion
 
08:12:25.350 --> 08:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
to repr Maron thank you Mr
 
08:12:27.628 --> 08:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
chairman I think this might be a point
 
08:12:30.948 --> 08:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
of order but do we have any amendments
 
08:12:35.270 --> 08:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
to this bill at the the wedes new or I'm
 
08:12:37.270 --> 08:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
not news but Newman spoke about I
 
08:12:39.788 --> 08:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
believe and I'm just saying why are we
 
08:12:41.788 --> 08:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
discussing something that isn't in our
 
08:12:41.798 --> 08:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
discussing something that isn't in our
hand

08:12:44.150 --> 08:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
hand
 
08:12:46.990 --> 08:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
so he we hav the amendment hasn't been
 
08:12:50.230 --> 08:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
drafted yet he's representative bate
 
08:12:53.270 --> 08:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
inquired about an amendment I I find it
 
08:12:54.750 --> 08:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable that if there is an amendment
 
08:12:57.468 --> 08:12:57.478 align:start position:0%
either on his way or intention that use
 
08:12:59.910 --> 08:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
it as a point of I know that he's not
 
08:13:01.468 --> 08:13:01.478 align:start position:0%
arguing the amendment he's basically
 
08:13:04.590 --> 08:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
arguing don't retain it because the's
 
08:13:08.190 --> 08:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
coming don't retain it to work on it he
 
08:13:10.190 --> 08:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
repr I mean to speak for represent bne
 
08:13:13.628 --> 08:13:13.638 align:start position:0%
is saying he has already worked on it is
 
08:13:16.110 --> 08:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
is what I gather from this
 
08:13:20.070 --> 08:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah representa Mar thank you one last
 
08:13:23.190 --> 08:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
thing does does representative Muse have
 
08:13:27.388 --> 08:13:27.398 align:start position:0%
a support and oppos numbers on this
 
08:13:30.430 --> 08:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:33.308 --> 08:13:33.318 align:start position:0%
legislation yes there were there were 71
 
08:13:35.670 --> 08:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
people who signed in in support and
 
08:13:38.270 --> 08:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
there were three people who signed in in
 
08:13:40.670 --> 08:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
opposition thank
 
08:13:43.548 --> 08:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
you and and just in in in respect to
 
08:13:46.270 --> 08:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
that those numbers again I I support the
 
08:13:48.308 --> 08:13:48.318 align:start position:0%
the concept of the body cers I just
 
08:13:52.308 --> 08:13:52.318 align:start position:0%
think this bill as presented I think
 
08:13:56.388 --> 08:13:56.398 align:start position:0%
is it's just violates article 288 in
 
08:13:58.750 --> 08:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's no FIS but we can we can fix
 
08:14:00.590 --> 08:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
that in this committee and I think we do
 
08:14:05.868 --> 08:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:05.878 --> 08:14:09.308 align:start position:0%
 
I

08:14:09.308 --> 08:14:09.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:11.948 --> 08:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
that no if we pass it it's a bigger
 
08:14:14.190 --> 08:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
problem now if we retain
 
08:14:16.868 --> 08:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
it what is
 
08:14:18.910 --> 08:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
what would that do to the March
 
08:14:23.510 --> 08:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
11 if we it it won't be heard until
 
08:14:26.270 --> 08:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
next amendments that are draft they can
 
08:14:29.150 --> 08:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
still draft we'll put them with a bill
 
08:14:31.308 --> 08:14:31.318 align:start position:0%
we get a fiscal note and we can consider
 
08:14:37.708 --> 08:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:41.430 --> 08:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
thing Consulting with the vice chair the
 
08:14:44.150 --> 08:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bill would be held in all like till
 
08:14:47.990 --> 08:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
next next year here however an amendment
 
08:14:50.750 --> 08:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 96 could literally pick
 
08:14:52.228 --> 08:14:52.238 align:start position:0%
this bill up and put it in there with
 
08:14:54.110 --> 08:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so for the people who
 
08:14:56.750 --> 08:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
want to address that we we have plenty
 
08:14:58.228 --> 08:14:58.238 align:start position:0%
of notice it's it hasn't even passed in
 
08:15:00.948 --> 08:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
the Senate yet so that's something maybe
 
08:15:03.270 --> 08:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
they put in
 
08:15:05.510 --> 08:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
consideration it is a it's different
 
08:15:06.590 --> 08:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
though it's just
 
08:15:08.350 --> 08:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
obviously some homework to do
 
08:15:08.360 --> 08:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
obviously some homework to do
representative

08:15:11.030 --> 08:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
08:15:14.388 --> 08:15:14.398 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I I just want to raise uh I
 
08:15:15.788 --> 08:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be support supportive
 
08:15:18.430 --> 08:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
of of making it not
 
08:15:21.910 --> 08:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory um and I support that from my
 
08:15:25.430 --> 08:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
belief that we P we this
 
08:15:27.910 --> 08:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has constantly passed
 
08:15:29.910 --> 08:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates down to cities and
 
08:15:34.308 --> 08:15:34.318 align:start position:0%
towns for many years by in requiring
 
08:15:36.590 --> 08:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory increases to property taxes
 
08:15:39.388 --> 08:15:39.398 align:start position:0%
for the cities and the towns because
 
08:15:41.628 --> 08:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
they can't they have to have a budget so
 
08:15:43.948 --> 08:15:43.958 align:start position:0%
they have to raise their property taxes
 
08:15:46.270 --> 08:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
and it's because of the state
 
08:15:48.510 --> 08:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
not living up to their original pledges
 
08:15:52.430 --> 08:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
to support pensions and education so we
 
08:15:54.150 --> 08:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't talk about it in that manner but I
 
08:15:56.070 --> 08:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
think that's an unfunded mandate to the
 
08:15:58.110 --> 08:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
cities and the towns so that's one
 
08:16:03.990 --> 08:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:07.510 --> 08:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:13.030 --> 08:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:15.628 --> 08:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
followup representative uh represent
 
08:16:18.830 --> 08:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
Newman you for follow thank you uh and
 
08:16:21.548 --> 08:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I I looked up in the
 
08:16:21.558 --> 08:16:22.430 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I I looked up in the
house

08:16:22.430 --> 08:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
08:16:27.548 --> 08:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
rules the uh what it means when you um
 
08:16:30.868 --> 08:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
itl a bill and when you retain a bill in
 
08:16:33.990 --> 08:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what I read and I
 
08:16:36.350 --> 08:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's correct or not my my
 
08:16:38.628 --> 08:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct and it said
 
08:16:41.270 --> 08:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
that when you retain a bill in the first
 
08:16:44.110 --> 08:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
year that in order to in order to bring
 
08:16:47.910 --> 08:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
it up in the second year you need it has
 
08:16:49.388 --> 08:16:49.398 align:start position:0%
to be approved by a majority of the
 
08:16:51.548 --> 08:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
rules committee so you I just don't
 
08:16:53.150 --> 08:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
think you automatically can just bring
 
08:16:55.830 --> 08:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
it up the second
 
08:16:58.990 --> 08:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
year we did it with the red flag last if
 
08:17:02.190 --> 08:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
you recall say again you did it with the
 
08:17:04.228 --> 08:17:04.238 align:start position:0%
red flag Bill HP
 
08:17:07.228 --> 08:17:07.238 align:start position:0%
687 we were both on the subcommittee we
 
08:17:09.670 --> 08:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:13.228 --> 08:17:13.238 align:start position:0%
of good sport all I'm doing is is is
 
08:17:14.628 --> 08:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
just telling you that I looked it up
 
08:17:17.070 --> 08:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
today I never knew where the authority
 
08:17:18.990 --> 08:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
was and that's what I understood from
 
08:17:20.708 --> 08:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
what I read we can talk about this some
 
08:17:25.270 --> 08:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
other time represent representative
 
08:17:27.228 --> 08:17:27.238 align:start position:0%
news one of the things that I just
 
08:17:30.468 --> 08:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure um that was said is
 
08:17:32.868 --> 08:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
we did hear some testimony uh that
 
08:17:35.510 --> 08:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
indicated there were real advantages for
 
08:17:37.468 --> 08:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
communities to be doing this at the same
 
08:17:40.228 --> 08:17:40.238 align:start position:0%
time and so one reason communities would
 
08:17:41.910 --> 08:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
do this at the same time would be if it
 
08:17:44.510 --> 08:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
was required and so you know if you take
 
08:17:47.190 --> 08:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
a look at the overall cost that would be
 
08:17:50.510 --> 08:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
spent you know on these systems um you
 
08:17:52.590 --> 08:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
know if if all New Hampshire communities
 
08:17:55.270 --> 08:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
were able to purchase this equipment
 
08:17:58.430 --> 08:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
through some sort of a like a joint RFP
 
08:18:01.750 --> 08:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
to have uh rfps for things like cloud
 
08:18:03.430 --> 08:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
services and things like that that tend
 
08:18:07.110 --> 08:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
to add significantly to the cost one of
 
08:18:09.510 --> 08:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
the things that you know that strikes me
 
08:18:12.708 --> 08:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
is it's a way to actually make it less
 
08:18:15.510 --> 08:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
expensive to get to a very good outcome
 
08:18:17.868 --> 08:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
um you know fairly quickly so so what I
 
08:18:20.948 --> 08:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
would one of the things I would urge is
 
08:18:22.510 --> 08:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
rather than doing the New Hampshire
 
08:18:24.228 --> 08:18:24.238 align:start position:0%
thing which is sort of throwing it back
 
08:18:27.150 --> 08:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
on communities to figure out you know
 
08:18:29.708 --> 08:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
you know you know have giving them the
 
08:18:32.670 --> 08:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
option of doing it or vers versus not
 
08:18:36.670 --> 08:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
doing it is to is to phase it in over
 
08:18:40.190 --> 08:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
several years so so for instance make it
 
08:18:42.990 --> 08:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
make it a requirement but do something
 
08:18:45.468 --> 08:18:45.478 align:start position:0%
potentially like change the the
 
08:18:49.468 --> 08:18:49.478 align:start position:0%
effective date or or maybe lay out you
 
08:18:52.110 --> 08:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
know three years or something like that
 
08:18:54.628 --> 08:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
um at the end of those by at the end of
 
08:18:57.150 --> 08:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
those three years all communities would
 
08:18:59.308 --> 08:18:59.318 align:start position:0%
be required you know to have this up and
 
08:19:02.110 --> 08:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
running um the advantage of that is we
 
08:19:04.190 --> 08:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
have this we'd have this uniform
 
08:19:06.670 --> 08:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
uniformly across the state in the long
 
08:19:09.670 --> 08:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
run it would probably cost less you know
 
08:19:11.468 --> 08:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
all of the police who testified even
 
08:19:13.110 --> 08:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
though they testified that they were
 
08:19:15.670 --> 08:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
neutral um they're main area of
 
08:19:18.030 --> 08:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
opposition seem to be trying to do our
 
08:19:19.548 --> 08:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
job which is trying to figure out how to
 
08:19:24.270 --> 08:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
pay for it um and you know if you it it
 
08:19:25.948 --> 08:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
strikes me that if
 
08:19:28.750 --> 08:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
we you
 
08:19:31.590 --> 08:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
know don't necessarily try to put it on
 
08:19:33.270 --> 08:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves all in the first year to
 
08:19:35.628 --> 08:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
figure out how to pay for it all at once
 
08:19:38.388 --> 08:19:38.398 align:start position:0%
we may be able to get this thing get
 
08:19:42.430 --> 08:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
this thing done and accomplished um and
 
08:19:45.190 --> 08:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
again there just seem to be you know a
 
08:19:47.468 --> 08:19:47.478 align:start position:0%
lot of real genuine benefits to doing it
 
08:19:49.190 --> 08:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of the key recommendations
 
08:19:51.830 --> 08:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the leak commission and and it really
 
08:19:53.510 --> 08:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be something that we all want
 
08:19:57.030 --> 08:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do um you know what I would just sort
 
08:20:00.788 --> 08:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
of suggest is you know if we retain it
 
08:20:04.628 --> 08:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
um we meet on it and we really do try to
 
08:20:07.030 --> 08:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
work this out because this this is a
 
08:20:10.150 --> 08:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
real opportunity here and I hate to see
 
08:20:11.350 --> 08:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know an
 
08:20:13.670 --> 08:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity at you
 
08:20:15.868 --> 08:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
know I think think they're so rare in
 
08:20:18.350 --> 08:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
this area it would be it would be great
 
08:20:20.228 --> 08:20:20.238 align:start position:0%
to be able to find a way to take
 
08:20:22.190 --> 08:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
08:20:24.708 --> 08:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
it Muse I will tell you
 
08:20:27.868 --> 08:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
that we may disagree on how to get to
 
08:20:29.388 --> 08:20:29.398 align:start position:0%
the end game but I think you and I agree
 
08:20:31.270 --> 08:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
on what we want the end game to be we
 
08:20:33.430 --> 08:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
both like I think we both agree that a
 
08:20:36.670 --> 08:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
version of this bill at one point should
 
08:20:39.788 --> 08:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
pass it it protects civilians it
 
08:20:42.788 --> 08:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
protects police officers but it's our
 
08:20:44.670 --> 08:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
job to figure out how to do the funding
 
08:20:46.430 --> 08:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
and and we don't even know how much it
 
08:20:49.190 --> 08:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
costs because there's no fiscal note and
 
08:20:51.308 --> 08:20:51.318 align:start position:0%
we got to then address the funding side
 
08:20:52.750 --> 08:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
we will do this in this committee I'm
 
08:20:55.628 --> 08:20:55.638 align:start position:0%
not to Simply as a chair if I didn't
 
08:20:57.628 --> 08:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
want this I'm not going to retain a bill
 
08:21:00.070 --> 08:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
just to retain it I would if that's the
 
08:21:02.990 --> 08:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
case I would I would be arguing to
 
08:21:05.468 --> 08:21:05.478 align:start position:0%
itl there's no need to retain a bill and
 
08:21:07.308 --> 08:21:07.318 align:start position:0%
just hold on to it on a subcommittee
 
08:21:09.150 --> 08:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know when it can be
 
08:21:11.070 --> 08:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
so the idea is and I've even gave
 
08:21:14.190 --> 08:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations that when Senate Bill 96
 
08:21:15.948 --> 08:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
comes this can turn to Amendment into
 
08:21:18.270 --> 08:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
that and we can work it out and figure
 
08:21:20.228 --> 08:21:20.238 align:start position:0%
that again we we see that bill when it
 
08:21:23.670 --> 08:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
gets here if it makes I I will say when
 
08:21:25.308 --> 08:21:25.318 align:start position:0%
it comes to the unfunded mandate and
 
08:21:27.788 --> 08:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
I've always since my first day in this
 
08:21:29.750 --> 08:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
body first day in this committee I
 
08:21:31.308 --> 08:21:31.318 align:start position:0%
always said if I find something to be
 
08:21:33.228 --> 08:21:33.238 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I like it or
 
08:21:37.270 --> 08:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
not I will I won't support and I this is
 
08:21:38.868 --> 08:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
one of the ones I'm not I'm not exactly
 
08:21:40.430 --> 08:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
happy about the situation but rather
 
08:21:42.868 --> 08:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
than itl it I'm I want to retain it so
 
08:21:45.270 --> 08:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
we can our committee we can fix and I
 
08:21:47.948 --> 08:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
think you're motivated to do it I I get
 
08:21:49.990 --> 08:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
the uh feeling that representative colle
 
08:21:52.030 --> 08:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
is motivated to doing this I think the
 
08:21:54.430 --> 08:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee is motivated working on this
 
08:21:59.830 --> 08:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:03.590 --> 08:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
move hands hands up line up in the road
 
08:22:06.510 --> 08:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
so let's let's work on this together and
 
08:22:08.070 --> 08:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
I think we can figure it out because
 
08:22:09.388 --> 08:22:09.398 align:start position:0%
there is some work to needs to be done I
 
08:22:10.468 --> 08:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
don't think we should just pass it
 
08:22:13.388 --> 08:22:13.398 align:start position:0%
knowing that it has a unfunded mandate
 
08:22:16.548 --> 08:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
issue represent Maron thank you Mr
 
08:22:21.350 --> 08:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
chairman on this motion um my first
 
08:22:24.110 --> 08:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
inclinations was that I wanted to see
 
08:22:27.430 --> 08:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
this bill itl but on the basis of
 
08:22:30.750 --> 08:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
Representative Welch and panelas having
 
08:22:35.708 --> 08:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:39.910 --> 08:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
retain repr Auber thank you Mr chairman
 
08:22:44.830 --> 08:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
um just one of the things that I don't
 
08:22:47.468 --> 08:22:47.478 align:start position:0%
see I don't know enough about it but I
 
08:22:49.750 --> 08:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
wonder if the state Poli I know that
 
08:22:51.270 --> 08:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
there was a recommendation that the
 
08:22:52.948 --> 08:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
state police get
 
08:22:55.270 --> 08:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
cameras I don't know if there's anything
 
08:22:58.270 --> 08:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
in the works to make that happen but it
 
08:23:00.948 --> 08:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
seems like if we retain it we can make
 
08:23:03.990 --> 08:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
we can use this as a vehicle to at least
 
08:23:06.308 --> 08:23:06.318 align:start position:0%
mandate that the state Bel
 
08:23:12.270 --> 08:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
to and if we orchestrate it correctly we
 
08:23:15.750 --> 08:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
can attract towns and cities to join on
 
08:23:18.388 --> 08:23:18.398 align:start position:0%
with the state police to use the same
 
08:23:22.910 --> 08:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the same software or or retaining
 
08:23:25.190 --> 08:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
information or ability to retain the
 
08:23:27.830 --> 08:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
information to cut the cost to the towns
 
08:23:30.708 --> 08:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
to attract attract
 
08:23:33.270 --> 08:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
towns to the process instead of
 
08:23:35.228 --> 08:23:35.238 align:start position:0%
mandating towns to the
 
08:23:38.110 --> 08:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
process that's that's an excellent idea
 
08:23:39.830 --> 08:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like a risk pool with insurance
 
08:23:40.910 --> 08:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I hear
 
08:23:45.150 --> 08:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
you very good idea I have no idea
 
08:23:49.228 --> 08:23:49.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:52.350 --> 08:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
thought representative uh Newman and
 
08:23:54.150 --> 08:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
repres news are your hands up from
 
08:23:56.228 --> 08:23:56.238 align:start position:0%
before or they up
 
08:23:58.670 --> 08:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
again you can say they're up again I I'm
 
08:24:02.308 --> 08:24:02.318 align:start position:0%
not mad Mr chairman my is up up again
 
08:24:04.190 --> 08:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Newman Mr chairman my
 
08:24:07.468 --> 08:24:07.478 align:start position:0%
hand is up thank you Mr chairman I also
 
08:24:10.590 --> 08:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
would re would would vote for retaining
 
08:24:12.510 --> 08:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so that we could really work on
 
08:24:16.030 --> 08:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
it next year but again I'd like I'd ask
 
08:24:18.788 --> 08:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
the uh the chair to uh check on the
 
08:24:20.628 --> 08:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
house rules because with my reading it
 
08:24:23.468 --> 08:24:23.478 align:start position:0%
says in the second year you have to have
 
08:24:27.548 --> 08:24:27.558 align:start position:0%
a you have to have um the approval of
 
08:24:29.468 --> 08:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
the just a majority approval from the
 
08:24:31.510 --> 08:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
rules committee to do that and that
 
08:24:33.308 --> 08:24:33.318 align:start position:0%
might be a result of when we changed
 
08:24:37.190 --> 08:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
last year's rules to the N the 2016
 
08:24:39.388 --> 08:24:39.398 align:start position:0%
rules so I'm not sure why that is but
 
08:24:43.468 --> 08:24:43.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:45.990 --> 08:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
be representative Welsh is going to
 
08:24:47.910 --> 08:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
respond that he may be more familiar
 
08:24:50.270 --> 08:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
with the rule that you're referring to
 
08:24:54.270 --> 08:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
I first of all representative every bill
 
08:24:57.350 --> 08:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
that gets drafted goes to the floor of
 
08:24:58.388 --> 08:24:58.398 align:start position:0%
the house
 
08:25:00.270 --> 08:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
eventually so I don't think that we're
 
08:25:01.670 --> 08:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to worry about the rules
 
08:25:04.190 --> 08:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee because the the motion to
 
08:25:07.590 --> 08:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
retain is something that I put
 
08:25:11.910 --> 08:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
in how many years ago 20 years ago and
 
08:25:15.948 --> 08:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
the whole idea was to save time
 
08:25:17.388 --> 08:25:17.398 align:start position:0%
because we don't have always have time
 
08:25:19.510 --> 08:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
to go through a difficult bill this this
 
08:25:22.350 --> 08:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
will be a difficult Bill I'm in favor of
 
08:25:26.190 --> 08:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
of body canas all the reasons that prer
 
08:25:29.948 --> 08:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
but we I don't see how we can do this on
 
08:25:33.030 --> 08:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
28a we don't know how much it cost we
 
08:25:37.590 --> 08:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:43.388 --> 08:25:43.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:43.398 --> 08:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
water

08:25:45.350 --> 08:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
water
 
08:25:47.948 --> 08:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
I point of order you're
 
08:25:50.468 --> 08:25:50.478 align:start position:0%
recognized I believe if we retain in
 
08:25:53.468 --> 08:25:53.478 align:start position:0%
committee that's a committee requirement
 
08:25:56.190 --> 08:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
when you rain on the
 
08:26:00.030 --> 08:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
floor the point of order is is it's a
 
08:26:02.948 --> 08:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
it's a when a parliamentary rule of
 
08:26:05.110 --> 08:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
procedure is not followed by the
 
08:26:09.150 --> 08:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
committee and if for example when I
 
08:26:11.708 --> 08:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
forgot to recognize representative rhods
 
08:26:13.388 --> 08:26:13.398 align:start position:0%
for the motion of B the pass the
 
08:26:15.228 --> 08:26:15.238 align:start position:0%
amendment just simply open up the
 
08:26:16.948 --> 08:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
discussion on an amendment motion that
 
08:26:19.228 --> 08:26:19.238 align:start position:0%
was never made that was a valid point of
 
08:26:22.030 --> 08:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
order but a question about the procedure
 
08:26:25.110 --> 08:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh just the question for informative is
 
08:26:27.150 --> 08:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
not if you ever just don't because the
 
08:26:28.590 --> 08:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
point of order I have to address it
 
08:26:30.468 --> 08:26:30.478 align:start position:0%
right away that that the point of order
 
08:26:33.228 --> 08:26:33.238 align:start position:0%
is out of order if you have a question
 
08:26:34.788 --> 08:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
you can ask it to the chair or to
 
08:26:37.948 --> 08:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
represent well myself we can address it
 
08:26:40.350 --> 08:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
just because representative Newman was
 
08:26:42.590 --> 08:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
in the middle of asking a question and I
 
08:26:43.910 --> 08:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
had to cut him off to address the point
 
08:26:45.070 --> 08:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
of order
 
08:26:47.110 --> 08:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
but your point of war
 
08:26:50.270 --> 08:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
was apologies it's no I'm just just
 
08:26:51.510 --> 08:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
explaining it
 
08:26:54.270 --> 08:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's so let represent representative
 
08:26:55.788 --> 08:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
Newman finish his question and then I'll
 
08:26:58.750 --> 08:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
recognize repres Mar for the
 
08:27:01.070 --> 08:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman thank you can you
 
08:27:05.110 --> 08:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
hear me yes yeah okay I'm I'm looking at
 
08:27:06.510 --> 08:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
the house rules and I'd like just to
 
08:27:08.468 --> 08:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Welch through
 
08:27:11.070 --> 08:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
you if I could okay let's let's let's
 
08:27:13.590 --> 08:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
focus on the we can discuss the rules
 
08:27:15.388 --> 08:27:15.398 align:start position:0%
after we we disc deide the question
 
08:27:17.350 --> 08:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
because the rules have nothing I've gone
 
08:27:19.910 --> 08:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
I've lived this dream before and I know
 
08:27:22.070 --> 08:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
how long this can go on for and it can
 
08:27:23.388 --> 08:27:23.398 align:start position:0%
go on for a long time so we're gonna
 
08:27:24.708 --> 08:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
we're goingon to call the question right
 
08:27:27.190 --> 08:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:30.910 --> 08:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:33.548 --> 08:27:33.558 align:start position:0%

08:30:40.910 --> 08:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
back and watch
 
08:30:44.150 --> 08:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
it just try to remember how long we are
 
08:30:47.788 --> 08:30:47.798 align:start position:0%
into it TimeWise you have any more
 
08:30:47.798 --> 08:30:49.948 align:start position:0%
into it TimeWise you have any more
bills

08:30:49.948 --> 08:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
bills
 
08:30:52.430 --> 08:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh if I can just ask a question of the
 
08:30:55.228 --> 08:30:55.238 align:start position:0%
committee we we have we do have one bill
 
08:31:00.030 --> 08:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
that we could exactly it was HB
 
08:31:02.910 --> 08:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
471 uh I think for the most part a lot
 
08:31:04.948 --> 08:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
of us support that bill the only concern
 
08:31:08.510 --> 08:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:11.110 --> 08:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
by it raised it but anyway it was a
 
08:31:13.788 --> 08:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
concern about if what's the procedure
 
08:31:15.590 --> 08:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
for for when someone wants to bring up
 
08:31:19.070 --> 08:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
the issue confidenti should that be
 
08:31:20.350 --> 08:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
behind closed
 
08:31:23.910 --> 08:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
doors as well how do you argue the is
 
08:31:25.430 --> 08:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
whether something's uh should be
 
08:31:27.430 --> 08:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
confidential not public without
 
08:31:29.070 --> 08:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
breaching confidentiality that would
 
08:31:31.868 --> 08:31:31.878 align:start position:0%
require if we choose to address that
 
08:31:33.270 --> 08:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
that would require Amendment so I don't
 
08:31:34.388 --> 08:31:34.398 align:start position:0%
know what the feeling of the committee
 
08:31:36.270 --> 08:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
is I would hate to see the bill fail
 
08:31:41.510 --> 08:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:46.548 --> 08:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:47.948 --> 08:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
who wants to take up the challenge of
 
08:31:47.958 --> 08:31:48.590 align:start position:0%
who wants to take up the challenge of
the

08:31:48.590 --> 08:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:32:00.030 --> 08:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:03.308 --> 08:32:03.318 align:start position:0%
yes representative P
 
08:32:06.548 --> 08:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
pelagus yes thank you Mr chairman I just
 
08:32:09.830 --> 08:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we all realize
 
08:32:12.830 --> 08:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
that this is during a
 
08:32:12.840 --> 08:32:15.070 align:start position:0%
