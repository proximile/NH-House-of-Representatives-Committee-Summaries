categories that you want us to cover
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay with the chair I'd just like to
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
make some preliminary remarks and then
 
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
we can dive into the details
 
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to thank you for all
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the work that you've put in over the
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
past many months
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
I know you've learned a lot about what
 
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court Family Division does
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
and particularly your focus on parenting
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
and marital cases and you've taken a lot
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
of time to hear from many people over
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
the last few months and I know you
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
worked over the summer as well and we're
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
very grateful for the time you've spent
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
I was especially pleased that every
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
member of the committee took an
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to visit one of our courts
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
last spring and I hope that was
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
educational and I hope you got a chance
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
to see how the Family Division operates
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
in a real day in real time and got to
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
meet some of the staff and see what
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
happens behind the scenes
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure and I haven't had a chance
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
obviously to be here for your hearings
 
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
or to watch them remotely but I'm sure
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard from a lot of people who
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
are unhappy with the Family Division and
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a surprise to me and
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
as I was thinking over the weekend about
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
coming here this morning I thought back
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
to my own career that started almost 40
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
years ago and I did a fair amount of
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
marital work in my early days as a
 
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.129 align:start position:0%
marital work in my early days as a
lawyer

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
and back then we appeared in the
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts there was no mediation
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
so either you settled your case or you
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
tried it in front of a superior court
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
judge or if you were lucky in front of a
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
marital master
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I would work hard to prepare those
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
cases and do my exhibits and my requests
 
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
for rulings and get the decision from
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
the judge and even when I thought it was
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
a good decision most often my client was
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
unhappy and so after a few years of
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
doing that I it wasn't very satisfying
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
work because I realized
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
there's no making clients happy in the
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
marital business so this idea of having
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
unhappy litigants from the divorce world
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
is certainly nothing it's not a new
 
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
is certainly nothing it's not a new
phenomenon

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
phenomenon
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk real briefly about the
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
resources in the Family Division because
 
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
we've just released our 2024 schedule
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
and not here to ask for resources I know
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
this is not the forum for that but I
 
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
think the numbers are instructive to
 
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
think the numbers are instructive to
explain

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh some of the complaints that you've
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
probably heard about cases not getting
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
heard fast enough or order is not
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
getting out quick enough
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
people wishing they had more time for
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
their temporary hearings and things like
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
that and as you consider legislation
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
which could impose new deadlines this
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
obviously is a factor too so we schedule
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
as I think you've all heard me say
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
before based on the weighted caseload
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory scheme that the
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
legislature created and for 2024 the
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
statutory need based on weighted
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
caseload is 13 303 days of Judge time
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's all in with every every case that
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
we need to hear may I interrupt you to
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
ask with the addition of six judges has
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
this gone up now or is this still a work
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
in process so Mr chairman that number is
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
irregardless of how many judges we have
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
that this is how many we need
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
what we have my next point I think will
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully be a list illustrative on that
 
00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259 align:start position:0%
we have currently 40 let's see 41
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
full-time judges we swore one in last
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
Friday we're swearing another one in
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
Thursday that gets us to 42 with all of
 
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
our full-time judges our part-time
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
judges our judicial referees which are
 
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.060 align:start position:0%
we have 13 judges now over the age of 70
 
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:20.300 align:start position:0%
who are currently hearing cases
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
they give us as many days as they will
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
or are allowed to give us all in with
 
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.500 align:start position:0%
everybody we have 10
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
916 days to give so we're short almost
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
2400 days
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
next year 22 calendar year 2024 which
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
equates to about nine and a half judges
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
we have just to answer your question Mr
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
Jim we have uh one judge who's currently
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
awaiting a public hearing next week
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have two unfilled vacancies that the
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
governor is has yet to fill and then in
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year starting July 1st
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
there are four more positions so if all
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
of those are filled we'll be at 49
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
judges and I think we'll still be sure
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
but we'll be in good shape but we have
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
at least four known retirements next
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
year too so it's kind of a
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
revolving door in the circuit court and
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
obviously as judges come on board they
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
have to be trained and brought up to
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
speed which we'll talk about training in
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
because so many of our cases involve
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines however and abuse
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
neglect cases guardianships termination
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
of parental rights landlord tenant those
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
cases have to get priority on our
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
dockets and where there's Flex it comes
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
from the Civil dockets the small claims
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
in civil cases and the divorce cases so
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
when we need to carve out time on the
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
docket for to meet those statutory
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
deadlines it's those cases the divorces
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
the small claims the civil cases that
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to get pushed out a bit
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
another data point I'd like you to
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
consider is that we get about 7 000 new
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
marital and parenting cases a year and
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
we get another fourth more than four
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
thousand reopened
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
family cases a year so add those
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
together that's the docket for the
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
Family Division and the marital
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
as you know 85 percent of our litigants
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
are self-represented we don't have court
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
monitors you've heard concerns about the
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
record in the Superior Court there's a
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
court monitor that sits at the recording
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
equipment all day long to make sure it's
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
working properly and the microphones are
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
working and all that so when we've had
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
instances where there are problems with
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
the record
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
chances are the judge turned the
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
recording on or the court security
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
officer turned the recording on and
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
there's no one to monitor that during
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
the day and and as you know we don't
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
have lock lurks so we have three staff
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorneys two today because one just
 
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.990 align:start position:0%
attorneys two today because one just
left

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
um our judges write their own orders law
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
clerks would certainly allow our judges
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
to write more complete and timely orders
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
but the data point that I think is
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
really important for you to consider is
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
seven thousand cases for four to five
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
thousand reopened cases in 2021 which is
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
the most recent data I could get from
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court there were 20 appeals
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
from final divorce orders two zero
 
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.260 align:start position:0%
twenty and there were another 42
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
discretionary appeals for other marital
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
issues which would be parenting child
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
support post-divorce cases
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
so a tiny fraction of the cases that our
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
judges hear like way less than one
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
percent actually get appealed and that's
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
where if there's a concern with a
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
judge's order or what evidence got in
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't that's where those issues
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
get sorted out so I think that's a data
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
point that tells you that by and large
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
overall the judges in the Circuit Court
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
Family Division are doing a great job I
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
mean less than one percent get appealed
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
I think that's a pretty important data
 
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.750 align:start position:0%
I think that's a pretty important data
point

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
and you've certainly heard about a lot
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
of cases that get drawn out for years
 
00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:50.459 align:start position:0%
you perhaps in the courts you were able
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
to see some of the files of those cases
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
that have gone on that take up you know
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
reams of paper
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
in 2014 we took a deep dive to look at
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
our time to disposition
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
we found that there are two common
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
threads that tend to make a case get
 
00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:08.779 align:start position:0%
long and drawn out one are complicated
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
divorces with lots of assets where there
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
are closely held corporations and maybe
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of experts but more importantly
 
00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:17.779 align:start position:0%
it's cases that involve disputes over
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
parental decision making and residential
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility that can cause a case to
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
go on for several years
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
that said most of the divorce cases in
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court resolve quite quickly
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent close within three
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.130 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent close within three
months

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
70 percent within six months eighty
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
percent are closed within nine months
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
and 87 percent are closed within 12
 
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
and 87 percent are closed within 12
months

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and of course those that drag on for
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
years take up a lot of resources and
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
slow down the process for the the cases
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise resolve more
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
quickly so bottom line I'm really proud
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
of the work that our judges and staff
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
that said we know we can always do
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
better we look forward to working
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with this group and
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
talking about whatever legislative
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
efforts you want to consider that will
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
make the process
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
go more smoothly so I
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
unless you want to ask questions now we
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
can get into the sort of four categories
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give the special committee a
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
chance to jump in at various times chair
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
the judges I had never focused in all
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
these years before on how
 
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.449 align:start position:0%
these years before on how
understaffed

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
the court is not so much with judges
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're understaffed
 
00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:56.779 align:start position:0%
but with clerks I had no I personally
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
had no awareness
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
that that judges in the Circuit Court
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
did not have clerks and other kinds of
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
administrative staff
 
00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
administrative staff
and

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
I guess I I'm kind of speechless I'm
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
shocked about it as I see it all I see
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
the effort you've made to try to use
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
Electronics to handle certain things but
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
no staff to assist the citizens who need
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
guidance and how to use that equipment
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
if you were to have
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
to bring more people in
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
would your first choice be to bring in
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
more judges or would it be to bring in
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
more staff I think I think that's an
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
easy question it would be to bring in
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
more staff and that was our pitch to the
 
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.590 align:start position:0%
more staff and that was our pitch to the
legislative

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
finance committee this year and actually
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
they were very good to us they gave us
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
31 new staff positions in the Circuit
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
Court which is enough to do what we need
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
to do the problem is as I sit here today
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
we have about 40 vacant positions that
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
were vacant
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
before the new budget kicked in
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
we very much want to fill those
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
positions first because those sort of
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
run the gamut from the entry level
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
positions to mid-level positions and we
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
want to sort out our internal candidates
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
and get those experienced folks situated
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
before we open up the the doors to the
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
outside so to speak and then we have
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
those 31 positions so we have over 70
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
vacant staff positions today Statewide
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court which is we had to
 
00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:50.779 align:start position:0%
close Candia for example because we had
 
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
zero staff in Candia we posted several
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
positions for the Candia Court we had no
 
00:15:56.699 --> 00:15:57.769 align:start position:0%
positions for the Candia Court we had no
applicants

00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
so we moved the Family Division cases to
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
Dairy and we send a judge and staff
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
members to Dairy once a week to do the
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
criminal docket which there are venue
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
issues in criminal cases but we very
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
much need to fill the staff positions
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
that we have I think all of our clerks
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
would agree if we fill those positions
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
with folks who are trained because
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty steep learning curve
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
most of the people that come in the
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
courts don't know what a plaintiff or a
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
defendant is for example
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
they don't know how the Odyssey case
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
management system works but once they're
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
trained if those seats are filled we'll
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
be getting orders out timely the judges
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
will have staff to process their cases
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
we won't have court monitors which I I
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
mean I that's an expense that would be
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
up to this body to fund
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
I wanted Superior Court Judge goes on
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
the bench they have a court monitor they
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
have a probably have a law Clerk and
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
they probably have someone from the
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
clerk's office most likely a deputy
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
clerk who's a lawyer in the courtroom
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
with them our judges are often as you
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
probably saw on your field trip in the
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
courtroom Maybe by themselves or maybe
 
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:03.620 align:start position:0%
with a ca2
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
sitting to process paperwork but it's
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's a different concept with a a court
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
assistant an entry-level Court assistant
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
I could just vacancies
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
and the reason we are we're told the
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
reason is because the salaries are too
 
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
reason is because the salaries are too
low

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.770 align:start position:0%
low
um

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
and then combined with the need for
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
why do you think that you have 40
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
vacancies now
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's a combination of factors
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive marketplace right now
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
to attract people we our number one
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
budget priority in this session which
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
the legislature funded was to raise the
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
labor grades for our entry level
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
positions we were at about 15 an hour
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
for starting wage and now we're closer
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
to 20. so that that is helping we're
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
seeing a little bit of a difference in
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
most areas of the state we're not losing
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
people to Dunkin Donuts and McDonald's
 
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.140 align:start position:0%
which we literally were before
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
as probably no surprise to this
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee though
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Millennials who are looking for jobs
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
don't care about health insurance
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
because either they're on their parents
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
health insurance or they're never going
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
to get sick they just want to know how
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
much am I going to get paid
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
by the hour what's my paycheck going to
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
be and I understand that so there are
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
other businesses that are paying more
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
hourly wages and don't have our benefits
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
we we're not competitive with them
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
and it's hard work
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
um you know we're paying these people
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money to get yelled at at
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
the window I I've told the story many
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
times but we were doing second
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
interviews in one of our courts and we
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
had the second interview candidates in
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
the lobby waiting to be called in for
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
the interview and there was a person at
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
the window in a Family Division case who
 
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
was screaming at a court assistant
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
because they were unhappy and one of our
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
candidates who I think was the leading
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
candidate got up and walked out and said
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
I can't work in this environment so it's
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
hard it's hard work and these are people
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
that are responsible to make sure that
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
arrest warrants are getting in the
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
system so if it's a warrant is vacated
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't get arrested over the
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
weekend it's it's important intense
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
high-level work and we don't pay a lot
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
let me follow up to what you just said
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
was there no one in law enforcement of
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
immediately or quickly available to stop
 
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
immediately or quickly available to stop
this

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
breach of the Peace
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
we don't I mean it
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
we don't engage certainly don't engage
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the court security
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
officers are are not going to I mean
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
they make ask someone to to calm down
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
but it's it it's a daily it's a daily
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
thing in most of our courts it's just
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
the nature of the business
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
does it need to be with the police
 
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.289 align:start position:0%
does it need to be with the police
presence

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I just
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's a I'm not sure if the police
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
presence is from time to time the police
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
do have to get involved if it gets
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
physical but I think the you know these
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
are emotional cases people have the
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
right to be emotional and unfortunately
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
our court staff are trained to try to
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
de-escalate uh we could we'll we're
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
working on that we're going to do a
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
training soon about de-escalation and
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with these situations both for
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
court security officers and for our
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
front line staff but it's it honestly Mr
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
chairman it's the nature of the it's the
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
nature of the Beast
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
um also to follow up on money did the 10
 
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.140 align:start position:0%
plus 2 percent raise that the
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
legislature amazingly agreed to in the
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
budget apply to uh Court Personnel yes
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
it did so it's not just the entry-level
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
position that got a bump it would be
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
other positions too that's true good
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.770 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
judge king for being here I'm just
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
wondering if there has ever been any
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
effort between the court system and the
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in trying to get
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
students perhaps who are not looking to
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
go on to college but perhaps want to do
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
an independent study or we offer
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
coursework in our high schools to try
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
and pull students who might be looking
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
for some type of a career in the law
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
system or in the courtroom or a
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
courthouse but not yet ready to move on
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
to college is there any ever been any
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
talk about doing that is a way of
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
bringing in more candidates yeah great
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
question representative well not
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
specifically with the Department of
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
Education we do send HR folks or HR
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
folks go to job fairs
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I've I've said I'll go to high
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
schools and try to recruit people myself
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
I mean it it can be a very rewarding
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
career we're about every year we do a
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
ceremony for our 25-year employees and
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
you'd be surprised how many folks stay
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
with us for a long time and get a career
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
out of it we have used summer interns we
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
had some this summer doing
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
you know more sort of routine processing
 
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299 align:start position:0%
destroying old files things of that
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
nature we recruit interns and externs
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
from the law school we're fortunate to
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
have Franklin Pierce I'm going to call
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
it Franklin Pierce Law Center because
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's what it was called when I went
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
there UNH School of Law first and second
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
your students who who several spend the
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
summers in our courts with our judges
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
who they sort of work as quasi-law
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
clerks and it's a great opportunity for
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
them and it's helpful to the judges and
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
staff even some college students who are
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
thinking about a career in the law we
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
have no money to pay them but
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
we take them out for lunch once in a
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
while and and give them some exposure to
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
the court system and an opportunity to
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
network and it that that's proven to be
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
I will do Apollo
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up would it be
 
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.409 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up would it be
something

00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
food in working with the doe to see if
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
we can establish some type of a of a
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
drawing system from the high schools to
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
offer entry-level positions and training
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely any feeding Network that we
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
can tap into to get
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
um applicants to come to the courts
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
wide open as far as I'm concerned I'd be
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up on that thank you
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
um judge king I am aware of a report
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
that was generated we were told that a
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
while ago saying how many more judges
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
are needed and the criteria for making
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
that recommendation I recollect had been
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
changed to something that was much more
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
realistic could you get us that report
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
as we're thinking not just thank you for
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
the new budget but the one coming up
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
pretty soon could we have copies of that
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely would you like an electronic
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
version would you like it in paper how
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
would you like it
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's about I don't know 90 Pages it's a
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
paper okay I'll make copies and I'll I
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
can send an electronic version too so
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
that you have the option the number is a
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
I think off the top of my head it's
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
rounded 65 judges is the need in the
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court we're fully loaded right
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
now 43. is there a cliff notes version
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
version of it uh there's an executive
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
summary that's I think what yes properly
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
called yes yes and I mean that was a
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
study that we started back in 2019 and
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
then this thing's called covid Hit And
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
we put the brakes on because we didn't
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to measure
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
the need during a pandemic so we
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
finished it up we actually restarted and
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
did it the only thing that I'll I'll say
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
to you when you review that and then and
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
the number it's a big number but bear in
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
mind that was a study where every single
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
judge and every staff member in both
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
Superior and circuit court kept detailed
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
logs every day for six weeks of
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
everything they did so I worked on a
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
criminal case for three minutes I mean
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
it was very detailed work
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
but we in the Circuit Court we measured
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
things the way we do them so a temporary
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
hearing was 30 minutes because it had to
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
be when I think the two judges behind me
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
that do this work would say we really
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
need an hour for temporary hearings we
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
just don't have an hour to give so we in
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
some ways we actually measured chaos but
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
the result is I think pretty
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
illustrative of the fact that we're
 
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.390 align:start position:0%
illustrative of the fact that we're
short

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
with the committee's consideration on
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
this would we like the 90-page report
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
sent electronically and the executive
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
summary sent both electronically and in
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.210 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
sounds good if we could have that
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
of course thank you not a problem
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.970 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
long

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you judge
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking more for data also on
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
staff support
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I know the twenty dollars was
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st uh increase in the
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
starting salaries I I don't believe
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
because of the work I saw him doing that
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars is gonna cut it so I
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have
 
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.470 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have
um

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
um some rollover uh you know how many
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
people how many people trained and
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
worked for six seven eight nine months a
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
year two years and left
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
um we do we we have some data on on
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
turnover I can tell you uh for example
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the information center which is where
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
all of our phone calls
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um we just we started the information
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
center in 2012 we just took our 5
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
millionth call this summer
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
each in we call them agents each
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
information center agent takes about a
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
hundred calls a day a lot of those are
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
from unhappy people a lot of them are
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
are borderline threatening we've had
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
death threats against judges that come
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
in I mean they're it's a high high level
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
job we have about a 60 turnover in the
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
information center which means ever for
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
every 10 people you hire six leave
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
within 12 months and it's an intensive
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
training process to get those folks on
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
board the good thing about those jobs is
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're thanks to what we learned during
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
covet almost all of the agents work
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
remotely so uh the twenty dollars an
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
hour goes further because they don't
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
have gas expenses for example which is a
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
way to attract people into those
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
positions even though they're they're
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
intense positions we're hoping people
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
will tend to stay in those longer
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
because of the remote aspect of the work
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the increased wages but I agree
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative along the 20 bucks Keeps
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
Us sort of uh the executive branch all
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
got the 10 raise too right so we're not
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
stealing people from them we're trying
 
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:57.500 align:start position:0%
to steal people from law firms
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
looking collaterally where we can for
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
example advertise in a paralegal
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
brochure that goes to paralegals
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
Association to see if we can attract
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
some of those folks to the court system
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
for our benefits that law firms might
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
not be able to offer quick follow-up
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you uh so is the data
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
accessible online or the HR data correct
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
no but I can get that for you all right
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
how many employees what the rollover is
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know if you did exit
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
interviews we have done we do exit
 
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:36.740 align:start position:0%
interviews not in every single case but
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
typically there's an exit interview and
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
I just round numbers we have about 375
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
non-judicial employees in the circuit
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
court so 70 percent I'm sorry 70
 
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.140 align:start position:0%
employees is you know pretty close to 20
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
vacancy right now any further questions
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
on Staffing or pay or hoped for Staffing
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
um please continue okay then I think
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
it's time for you to hear from the
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
experts uh if you want to indulge I
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
would call Judge lemur up to talk about
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
gardening ad items and parenting
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
coordinators if that's I can do that in
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
a minute but before you go I was under
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
the impression that one of the reasons
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
Family Court was started so that someone
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
sitting in the courtroom who's very sad
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's a divorce situation there's a lot
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
of emotion it could be sitting next to
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
somebody who in a criminal trial and
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
they didn't think that that was very
 
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.470 align:start position:0%
they didn't think that that was very
good

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
um I may have been given false
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.190 align:start position:0%
um I may have been given false
information

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand the question Mr
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sorry the question would be
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
if you've got people who they're going
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
to be hearings
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
um this is before Family Court started
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
you are in circuit court and the next
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
case may be more of a crime than the one
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was just a divorce first of all
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
need to know if that is a was a fact
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
so before there was a circuit court or
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
before there was a family division the
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
divorces were in Superior Court okay so
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
that would not be a fact then what I
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
just mentioned as a reason to carve out
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
Family Court no I think the reason the
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
Carvel Family Court I wish
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was here because he
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
would agree with me the Superior Court
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do divorces anymore so
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
they were trying to figure out a way to
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
get rid of them they came up with the
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
idea of marital Masters which was a help
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
but judges were still doing them and so
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
the idea was to create the Family
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
Division which was a pilot project in
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
1996 in Rockingham County and in Grafton
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
County and it was I think the longest
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
pilot project in the history of the
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
court system but it went on for a long
 
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.909 align:start position:0%
court system but it went on for a long
time

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
eventually under the leadership of Chief
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
Justice delanis at rolled out we didn't
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
finish rolling it out until about two
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
years ago when we finally closed the
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
Plaistow Court that's when the Family
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
Division rollout was complete but the
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
idea was to the concept and it's in the
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
statute was to have one judge for one
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
family which we've talked about before
 
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds great in reality it's hard
 
00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:11.779 align:start position:0%
to do for a variety of reasons
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
but the idea was to have
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
specialized judicial officers which
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be originally marital Masters who
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
were specially trained in marital cases
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
judge Lemire was a marital Master we had
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
a robust marital master program and then
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature as part of the Circuit
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
Court Bill House Bill 6 uh 629 I believe
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
in 2011 eliminated marital Masters we
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
have no more marital Masters we had 13
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
when we created the Circuit Court Tom
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
Cooper was the last he's now retired the
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
idea was that judges would be better
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
suited to hear marital cases and the
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
Masters weren't doing a good job and now
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
you're hearing about the judges that
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
aren't doing a good job so I don't think
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that was the Magic Bullet but that was
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
attempting to lay a foundation but I'm
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead without one
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and if this is not the time in this
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
morning and someone else is to
 
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:07.580 align:start position:0%
um speak to this please let me know
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
I am sensing some growing sentiment that
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence issues should be
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
separated out from Family Court even if
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
that means two people are going to now
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
be in two separate things because the
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
whole idea of of
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
is just one negative on top of all the
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
other issues that are civil issues
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
and that's the feedback I continue to
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
get I ponder that I just wonder
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
um your thoughts on that I think in most
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the courts and again we have courts
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are really small like Colebrook and
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
North Haverhill and we have very large
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
courts like Manchester and Nashua
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
I think most of the in most of the
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
courts the clerks try to schedule
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and stalking cases on
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
their own sort of mini docket and
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester for example I think every
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
morning there is a a list of domestic
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
violence cases assigned to a judge
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
so that they're not interspersed with
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
other cases going on at the same time if
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's what you're getting at Mr
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
chairman I think we try to do that now
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's a criminal component
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
of a domestic violence case true which
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
is not a wooden domestic violence be by
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
itself a criminal case well the domestic
 
00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:29.690 align:start position:0%
itself a criminal case well the domestic
violence

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
protective order of matter is a civil is
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
a civil case okay
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up Vice chair oh
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
on this I just want to ask you Mr
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman if what you were acknowledging
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
at the point one point that judge king
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
just made that
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is can be both civil
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
and Criminal
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
and so that gets you in different courts
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
but then in addition
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
divorce case they can be a divorce issue
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
and a domestic violence issue
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
same principles of principles meaning
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
ALS not Les same people involved
 
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:22.820 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
realities is because people function in
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's possible that there is a judge
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
involved in one part
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
of family
 
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.369 align:start position:0%
of family
exes

00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
exes
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh concerns that are before the courts
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
and another judge is involved in another
 
00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.169 align:start position:0%
and another judge is involved in another
part

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
of that same family's concerns and for
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
many reasons
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's not easy for them
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
to know what both the left hand and the
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
right hand are doing and
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's an answer to
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
that is there well that's certainly true
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
the the fact that many divorce and
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
parenting cases have a domestic violence
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
component ideally the same judge would
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
handle those
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
but again for a variety of reasons
 
00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:20.300 align:start position:0%
judges move
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
in the smaller courts particularly on
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
the front end of a domestic violence
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
case where there's the ex-party petition
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
if it's filed if it's a Colebrook or a
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
Lancaster or a case or North table they
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
might not be a judge in the in the
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
county so another that's going to get
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
shipped electronically to another judge
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
to rule on
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
um the final hearing will always be held
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the venue where it's filed hopefully
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
with a judge who will handle the
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
companion case if there is one but it
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
I will continue to Monitor and I will
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
start better recording people who are
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue to me with some
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
narrative this could be something at a
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
later date for a conversation absolutely
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if you have a specific case
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
with the docket number we can take a
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
look at it we can look at the companion
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
case and we can answer more specific
 
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.770 align:start position:0%
case and we can answer more specific
questions

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
and I would say to my friends in the
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
audience who at least two of you have
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
very good networks of people who are
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with these matters
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
um I will be open to receiving such
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
information by email
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you and yes representative long uh
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on this on the
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
same top topic my understanding as the
 
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:37.220 align:start position:0%
judges have access to criminal and civil
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
cases correct
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
So a family a family court judge
 
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
So a family a family court judge
can

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
look into a criminal or civil uh with
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
the lit against CCN and family court if
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
there's a civil or Criminal
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure if I if I understand the question
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
correctly they can take judicial notice
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
of another case they typically don't do
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
that on their own because we can't go
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
outside the record of the case but if a
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
party said for example I want you to
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
take judicial notice of this case and
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
this docket number that's allowable okay
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
to follow-up follow-up yeah I wanted
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
that was my next question is that is
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
that access helpful because we're
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
um of those situations and they're not
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
checking the criminal uh Records uh or
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
vice versa
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's an issue but is
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
that access helpful for a family court
 
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
that access helpful for a family court
judge

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on in those civil
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
or criminal cases I I don't I'm and
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the experts behind me who
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
does this work every day can give you a
 
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
better answer for my answer would be it
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
could be but it might not be material or
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
relevant to the cases before the judge
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
at that particular time great thank you
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
judge king for coming in for taking my
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
question I think part of what rep long
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
is referring to is we've heard of
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
instances where a temporary order
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps was issued in
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
civil court and uh Family Court
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
um a protective order and then another
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
party will go file for a temporary order
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
the opposite party will go file for a
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
temporary order and criminal court and
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
if they lie on the form and don't say
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
that there's another case you guys don't
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
go and look it up so then there's two
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
conflicting orders against each other
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
against the opposite parties
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
so it's not routine to look up so what
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying is unless a party asked
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
you to look up this other case you
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't on your own go to look and see
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
if there was another pending case in the
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
other court
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
staff should check Odyssey to see if
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
there is a matter but I I'm not going to
 
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.020 align:start position:0%
say that it happens every single time
 
00:38:59.530 --> 00:38:59.540 align:start position:0%
the the information would be available
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
assuming that the other case was entered
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
into Odyssey sometimes one party goes to
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
one Court another party goes to another
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
court it's sort of at the same time
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
seeking the same relief and judges May
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
issue competing orders not knowing and
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
if it hasn't been entered there's no way
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
we would know
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
um but ideally if it was in the system
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
and we knew that would be something we
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
would want we would want to take into
 
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.910 align:start position:0%
would want we would want to take into
account

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up approximately how long does it
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
typically take to get things entered I
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
fully understand that you guys are are
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
really busy so is it usually a few days
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
or how long is it generally
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to defer to judge
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
Ashley on that one because she's she has
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
more administrative experience in is in
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
the courts up like a cbpo a criminal
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
Bill protective what are those things of
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
that nature get entered very quickly
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
we don't I mean do we sometimes miss
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
them of course where it is human error
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
but they are supposed to get in in the
 
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.140 align:start position:0%
DV orders go in quickly they go to the
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
registry we have staff that stay after
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
hours five days a week to make sure
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
those are entered the FBI has really
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
strict requirements for getting those
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
orders into the database so that they're
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
visible to law enforcement so those
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
kinds of orders are processed very
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
quickly judge Ashley just want to add
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
just on the issue of the domestic
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
violence civil orders those are
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
definitely entered into same day they
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
have to be some people can't leave until
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're make sure that they're ordered
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
and they're in the system and
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
um and they're processed I would just
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
add on the issue of being able to access
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
other matters and you've mentioned
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
um they're the court does not do record
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
checks of folks to so if too lit against
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
or before us we are not doing a blanket
 
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:57.140 align:start position:0%
record check of all of their histories
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
that is really beyond our
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
Province when we're hearing a particular
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
case so someone as judge Kings would say
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
might ask us to take notice of something
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
because again there might be an order of
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
protection in a criminal charge so the
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
states brought a case there is an order
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
of protection it's a bail order of
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
protection that exists and it's
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
important for us to know that
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with a domestic
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
violence case certainly to know that the
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
defendant is facing criminal charges but
 
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:30.380 align:start position:0%
we don't always have that information
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
before us and again we're hearing what
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
folks are bringing to us and bringing to
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
the table as they're trying to prove
 
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
the table as they're trying to prove
their

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
burden approve in the case if that's
 
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.150 align:start position:0%
burden approve in the case if that's
helpful

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you anything further
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Pearson and the
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's such a pleasure to be here I am
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to speak in just a moment about
 
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.470 align:start position:0%
going to speak in just a moment about
um

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
really uh some of the resources we do
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
have some resources we might like to
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
have in the family division with respect
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
to in particular high conflict parenting
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
cases briefly just a little bit about me
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
and how I got here I am a native of New
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grew up in Northampton and
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
went to law school in Boston and I came
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
back to practice law here in New
 
00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:38.290 align:start position:0%
back to practice law here in New
Hampshire

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:38.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
in 1995 I began my practice and I
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire Maine and
 
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.370 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire Maine and
Massachusetts

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:45.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
primarily family law but also a general
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
civil litigation practice I practiced
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
for about 14 years before I was
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
appointed to the bench as a marital
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
master and that was in 2010 January of
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
2010 I began that service and enjoyed it
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
very very much but as you heard judge
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
king say
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
um by 2011 there was already that was
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
when the Circuit Court was formed and as
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
part of that marital Masters were no
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
longer going to be part of that system
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
I was appointed uh fortunately and I am
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
honored to have been appointed as a
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge towards the end of
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
2012. so I have been a circuit court
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
judge now for 11 years and I've
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
practiced in Manchester was where I
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
began and that's where I served for
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
three years as a marital Master hearing
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
solely parenting and divorce and other
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
types of Family Division cases five days
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
a week and then I sat in Portsmouth for
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
three years and then Dover for four
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
years and I've been in Brentwood now for
 
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:51.980 align:start position:0%
almost four years
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
I I also just wanted to say that I um I
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
was very fortunate growing up and I was
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
reminded of this when judge king spoke
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
about our staff who are fantastic it
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful if we could maintain
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
the experienced staff a few that we do
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
have for as long as possible because
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
that institutional knowledge is
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
incredible and important to have my
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
mother was a staff Court assistant in
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
what used to be called The Domestic
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
Relations Department of the superior
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
court she started out in District Court
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
in Hampton and then she in Rockingham
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
County she was a court assistant in the
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
domestic relationship department and she
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
was there for more than 35 years before
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
she retired 20 years ago now and it was
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
through her that I
 
00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
gained an affinity for the law for the
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
court system for the courthouse in
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
Brentwood in particular so it's
 
00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:52.270 align:start position:0%
Brentwood in particular so it's
especially

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
she before she retired she did work a
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
little bit in the new I still call it
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
the new courthouse in Brentwood where I
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
sit now it was 1996 I believe when they
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
made that change from the old one on
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
Exeter Road
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
but it's almost like coming home for me
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be sitting where I am now and to be
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
serving the people of New Hampshire in
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
the way that that I and and others of us
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
who serve in the Family Division are are
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to do and we're trying
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
to do the best that we can is that the
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
court one of the divisions that is going
 
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:28.220 align:start position:0%
to move over to the new building
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
no okay so yours isn't leaking and yours
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
does work sort of
 
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
does work sort of
um

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand that question
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's a Connie roof from Rockingham
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
County I have eyes on that complex in
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
Brentwood and the new one that's being
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
built because some of the old one
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
um should be demolished so I just
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
wondered if your part was working okay
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's working okay as far as I know as
 
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
far as I know sometimes I'm the last to
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
know but as far as I know
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
um I I also I'm very involved in the
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
training of the new judges that come on
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
I spend three full days just myself with
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
them on many areas of family law and as
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
much as I can impart upon them from my
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
own knowledge and experience when we do
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
have new uh judges come on board I'm a
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
member of the judicial conduct committee
 
00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:23.809 align:start position:0%
member of the judicial conduct committee
um and

00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so I I see another aside of
 
00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:28.069 align:start position:0%
um so I I see another aside of
um

00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
of what we all do in that context I
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
value that experience that I have very
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
very much and I think it also
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it it it helps me to to continue to
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
do the work that I do
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
um the way that I do it and I hope that
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I am I mean I we can all use some
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
improvement uh and I hope that I am
 
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.809 align:start position:0%
improvement uh and I hope that I am
helping

00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
um the system as much as I possibly can
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
because that is my own aspiration I am
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
married I have three adult children I
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
have one grandchild I just had my first
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
grandson born in May of this year
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and um so that's just a little bit
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
about me but now I want to turn to a
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
very important topic that I understand
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
is one that you're interested in looking
 
00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:18.859 align:start position:0%
into and that is the use of or perhaps
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
what might be a future use of more
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals and other
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
types of Professional Resources within
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in high conflict
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
parenting cases these cases are just a
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
part of of what we do here in the Family
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
Division I'm not going to bore you you
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
probably have unless you ask I would be
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
happy to expand on the types of cases
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
that we do here within the Family
 
00:47:46.089 --> 00:47:46.099 align:start position:0%
Division but
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
this is a part of them but this is a
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
very very very important but often
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
challenging part of what we do as Family
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
Division judges is to hear cases where
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
there is high conflict at times between
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
the parents that are going through
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably one of if not the most
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time in that family's life and
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
um perhaps even more so for the child or
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
children that are involved in those
 
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.730 align:start position:0%
children that are involved in those
cases

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:09.740 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
as you heard and as you've discussed and
 
00:48:13.809 --> 00:48:13.819 align:start position:0%
as you've mentioned
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
there is a lot involved Beyond just the
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
law there are emotions involved there
 
00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
are tensions there is distrust there is
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
a lot involved in in the Dynamics of
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
these cases and we as judges do the best
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we can with the law and following
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
the law and the case law and the
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
statutory law in New Hampshire
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
but when we can utilize other resources
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
to help a family if we're able to do
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
that then then we want to be able to do
 
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:50.540 align:start position:0%
that our statute as you know 461a
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
was something that was enacted in 2005
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
now I still call it the new statute
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
because I I started practicing in this
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
area of law in 1995. but it it's the
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
um the statute that as you know governs
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities in
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was a sweeping overhaul
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the law back at that time it was the
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
parent parental rights and
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
responsibilities act that was enacted by
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature then and there was a
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
task force on family law that did a
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
two-year study at that time and it
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
resulted in this new statute and it
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
began a way of looking at these cases
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
differently I still remember it quite
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
well when it was enacted we stopped or
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
we tried very hard to stop using words
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
like custody and visitation because what
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
it did was it created at least the task
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
force thought at the time a win or lose
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
type of dynamic as opposed to giving
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
parental autonomy moving forward in
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
these cases and so there was a shift
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
towards wanting to help parents help
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
parties make their own decisions if they
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
can in a safe and healthy way that would
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
then be in the best interest of the
 
00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.990 align:start position:0%
then be in the best interest of the
children

00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
but there there's always a difficult
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
time doing that when we're also working
 
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:08.339 align:start position:0%
within what is an adversarial system the
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
court the courtroom with a petitioner
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
and a respondent we may call them
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
petitioner and respondent as opposed to
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Plaintiff and defendant in the Family
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
Court setting but still it's one party
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
in the other party but what we have is
 
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
two parents and we have a child or
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
children and a family before us so as
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
judges the statute requires that we
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
support frequent and continuing contact
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
between each child and both parents
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
unless it can clearly be shown to be
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
detrimental to a child to do that
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
what we do is when they first come to
 
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:43.220 align:start position:0%
court and they file their petition
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
we have what we call a first appearance
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
session and we explain the court process
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
to them particularly if they don't have
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
attorneys or one party doesn't have an
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
attorney we refer them to mediation
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
because now under the statute mediation
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
is mandatory in cases involving minor
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
children unless a certain exception
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
applies and we try to help the parents
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
to resolve the issue on their own with
 
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:12.260 align:start position:0%
the assistance of a trained
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
mediator and if they can many many cases
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
do many cases settle even before they
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
reach that point when they file they've
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
got an agreement because they have done
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
that reached that cooperatively
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
beforehand or they they resolve the case
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
in mediation but there are those cases
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
and these are the the very challenging
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
ones where the parents cannot maybe they
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
cannot communicate will not communicate
 
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:37.940 align:start position:0%
or they communicate in a very healthy
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
and sometimes just horrible way with one
 
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
another that most certainly the children
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
are experiencing I have to imagine
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
outside of or within the home or homes
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
but we have to help the parents create a
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that is really the road
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
map moving forward for how they're going
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
to raise that child or children together
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
even though they're in now separate
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
households and it can be quite
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
challenging with some cases and so when
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
they cannot do that on their own then
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's up to us as the Family Division
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
judges to create a parenting plan that's
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
in the child or children's best
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
interests taking certain factors that
 
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:18.500 align:start position:0%
are in the statute into consideration
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
but we can only do that with the
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
information that we receive from the
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
parties themselves because we have to
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
make factual findings and then we have
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
to apply the law to those findings to
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
determine what's in the child's best
 
00:52:32.099 --> 00:52:33.290 align:start position:0%
determine what's in the child's best
interests

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
some cases a party or a parent or the
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
other parent or maybe even both
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
have mental health issues maybe
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
substance use issues there may be
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in in a dynamic
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
involved that that
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for a parent
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
especially one that's representing him
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
or herself to present in evidence or
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
information to us to help us make that
 
00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.730 align:start position:0%
information to us to help us make that
decision

00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
in our statute 461a then there is
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
authorization for us to appoint we may
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
appoint a guardian ad litem to a case a
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem might be appointed in
 
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
such a case because we have determined
 
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.370 align:start position:0%
such a case because we have determined
that

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
um the child would benefit from someone
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
another party going and talking to the
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
parents talking to the parents
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
references talking to the children
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
themselves making a report to the court
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
with information that we cannot go out
 
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
and get ourselves and that for whatever
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
reason we may not be getting from one or
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
both parties it it ideally it sounds
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic but in reality most of the
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
cases that need a guardian ad litem
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
cannot have one because the parties
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
can't afford a guardian ad litem and we
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
cannot appoint one if the parties can't
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
afford to privately pay for Guardian Ad
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Litem Services we used to have many
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
years ago a gal fund similar to the
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
mediation fund we have now for Indigent
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
parties to be able able to have that
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
service in their case but that has long
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
been gone and so there is no option now
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
and a guardian ad litem is quite
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
expensive often the hourly rate is about
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
120 but it could be less and often more
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
than that and we when we appoint a
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem we'll put a maximum a
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
cap on the fees they are to charge but
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
as many people who have difficult cases
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
know that last a very long time often
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and the guardian ad litem
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
has a large job to do takes many hours
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
and in in some cases it could be several
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for that for that
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
resource to be available and then that
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
person reports to the court and it's
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
just it's it's evidence like any other
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
evidence we receive in the case and we
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
give it what weight we we believe it
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
deserves the parties are able to
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
cross-examine the guardian ad litem and
 
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:53.540 align:start position:0%
question the guardian ad items report
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not determinative
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
but it can be very helpful it's just
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
that we can't use it as much as we would
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
like to the other thing that we have is
 
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.380 align:start position:0%
I spoke about mediation and mediators
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
but in some cases if the parties can't
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
afford it again this is a financial
 
00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:15.980 align:start position:0%
issue to a large extent we will employ
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
outside mental health professionals
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
and that may take the form of a
 
00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:22.089 align:start position:0%
and that may take the form of a
counselor

00:55:22.089 --> 00:55:22.099 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
that will work um you know hopefully the
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
children if they if they need it or in
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
counseling the parents often will come
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
to court and inform me that the children
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
are already in counseling and I'm always
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and and that's a that's something
 
00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:39.859 align:start position:0%
that needs to be respected and and
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
protected but then what I'm talking
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
about is a counselor that might work
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
with the family as a whole or with
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
um the children and the parents or
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
something that is called a parenting
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
coordinator or sometimes a co-parenting
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
coach that would work with the parents
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
in particular because many of these
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
parents in in this small subset of cases
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
that are that are very high conflict
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
cannot communicate with one another
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
cannot maybe will not maybe one is
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
trying really really hard and the other
 
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
just won't respond or responds in an
 
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:14.780 align:start position:0%
unhealthy way
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
and so someone that is usually a mental
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
health professional counselor or perhaps
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
an attorney might provide services as a
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator that would work
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
with the parents specifically to try and
 
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.140 align:start position:0%
educate them on healthy co-parenting
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
communication facilitate that encourage
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
that and try to manage that but that
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
again is something that's not often
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
covered by the party's insurance we
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
always check to see what they have
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
available for insurance coverage with
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
respect to counselors and the like and
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
there's often a health a healthy
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expense for that and many
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
people can't just simply can't afford
 
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.309 align:start position:0%
people can't just simply can't afford
that

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything like that
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
in-house of course you've heard the
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
numbers that judge king shared with you
 
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.690 align:start position:0%
numbers that judge king shared with you
about

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:01.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
what we have in terms of our court staff
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
as it exists today
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
um in in a perfect nut perfect but in a
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
more Ideal World we would have a enough
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
money to be able to create a court
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
system that would have some in-house
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
professionals to assist I went to a
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
conference of Judges this spring with
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
judges from all over the United States
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
and outside and other countries and I
 
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
learned about some incredible work that
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing with overhauling their
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
court systems a lot of it was
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
spearheaded by covid-19 and in 2019 2020
 
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
when things became very difficult and
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
they had to really look at how they were
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
handling these cases making sure that
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
they were being treated as they should
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that these people who were their
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
situation isn't changing just because
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's a pandemic in fact it made it
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
created a whole nother set of
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
difficulties within the family Dynamic
 
00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
and they still needed to be helped by
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
the court system so for instance in Los
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
Angeles they have re-hauled their court
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
system and they have court services
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
officers now they hired 10 right off the
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
bat their mental health professionals
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
who when a case comes in with parenting
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
issues they screen it and triage it
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning to determine
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
what's what resources does this family
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
need as to help them through this
 
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
need as to help them through this
process

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
um Australia has completely overhauled
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
its family court and it did take 235
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the legislature to
 
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:33.740 align:start position:0%
do it that was all of Australia mind you
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
but I've spoken with judges there who
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
helped and worked they worked very
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
closely with their legislature to make
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
this happen so that they were able to
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
professional Mental Health Service
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
people who work now as Court employees
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
and um and they're seeing tremendous
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
results and in the long term it's
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
helping their families and it's it's
 
00:58:57.049 --> 00:58:57.059 align:start position:0%
helping the courts be more efficient but
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
most importantly it's helping the
 
00:58:58.500 --> 00:58:59.470 align:start position:0%
most importantly it's helping the
children

00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
yes would you
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
speculate that
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
a an experiment in one County with this
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
might be funded especially a smaller
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
County that thud you heard was
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler head of Finance
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
picking himself up off the floor but if
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
we did this in a smaller County with
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
such a triage with a few resources to
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
see how it works would that be something
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
that might be a good idea I think it
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful I I was that was a
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
leading question
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
and that's all right I'll allow those
 
00:59:35.819 --> 00:59:38.690 align:start position:0%
and that's all right I'll allow those
today

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can't I can't speak for
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
everyone uh within the family court
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
system nor am I am I here attempting to
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
do that but I I have been doing this a
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
long time now and I've worked with I
 
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
don't know how many thousands of
 
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.150 align:start position:0%
don't know how many thousands of
families

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm just one I'm just one judge
 
00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.650 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm just one I'm just one judge
but

00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
I have found in my experience that
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
and even more so of late
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
that to have someone more qualified than
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
I in child psychology in in family
 
01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
I in child psychology in in family
Dynamics

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
 
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:15.950 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
um

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
be involved with help with the case is
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
of benefit and that's not to say that
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
the times that that that things of that
 
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:28.220 align:start position:0%
nature have been employed have always
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
worked perfectly they certainly haven't
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine but I have had
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
cases before me where the parties agree
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
the parties agree they may have
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys the attorneys agree that
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
something has to happen something needs
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
to to change somebody needs to help this
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
family and it can't just be the laws of
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire or anything
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
that I have the authority by Statute to
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
do and they agree that I can appoint
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
someone to come in as a family therapist
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
or somebody a parenting coordinator I
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've I've ordered that
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
there be one if the parties haven't been
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
in agreement because and I think that a
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
mental health professional who does this
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
type of work would tell you it it's not
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
likely to be successful if both parties
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
aren't on board with it
 
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.210 align:start position:0%
aren't on board with it
um

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.470 align:start position:0%
um
I

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
when thinking about this issue
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
I was reminded that that there are some
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
folks within the state of New Hampshire
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
in the mental health community and
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
attorneys who do primarily family law
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
who do offer parenting coordination
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
services I don't think that they're
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
often employed but again I think it's
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
the financial piece
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
um in in many many cases that makes that
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
difficult yes representative catab
 
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.829 align:start position:0%
yeah and thank you for taking my
question

01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so right now besides parties just
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
agreeing to do the parenting
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
coordinators is there any that I
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
couldn't find there wasn't a statue that
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily allowed the court to order
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
them to to do so right or did I miss
 
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.329 align:start position:0%
them to to do so right or did I miss
something

01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
no there is uh there is a provision
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
within RSA 461a that speaks to um and
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the creation of the
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
parenting plan itself I think it may be
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
in section six
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
um towards the end of the section Roman
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
numeral two or three I think
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that speaks to the fact that if we
 
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
are going to order
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
um parties to have or or the family to
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
have any counseling that we need to look
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
first to whether or not that's covered
 
01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:43.460 align:start position:0%
by insurance
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and try to select someone in the first
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
instance that's covered by the party's
 
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.970 align:start position:0%
instance that's covered by the party's
insurance

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:48.980 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that there's another
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
Express language section within the
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
statute that speaks to that but there
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
there is at least that much that I that
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
I know and so from my perspective
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
um if there is also let me say this
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
though there is also some language
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
within the statute and also it appears I
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
think in the statute concerning
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
Guardians ad litem that allows the court
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
and or the guardian ad litem in uh
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate cases to
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
um to bring in outside resources to
 
01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
assist with the family
 
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:31.460 align:start position:0%
um but doesn't specifically say
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator and I think
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator at least as far as
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
I know is a term that's that's it's been
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
a trend nationally
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
um in the last few years and it's not
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
something that has always
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
um at least known to me in the court
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
system but I think it's gaining traction
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
I know that in some jurisdictions uh it
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator may be
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
appointed by the court to do the things
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
that I've mentioned but also serves as
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an arbitrator in terms of
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
making being able to make a binding
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
decision that keeps the parents out of
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
court but helps them make you know if
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
they can't make the decision by
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
agreement with the that person's
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
assistance that parenting coordinator
 
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
can then make the decision and they're
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
Bound by it we wouldn't be able to do
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
that as New Hampshire judges there was a
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
case in 2020 from the New Hampshire
 
01:04:30.609 --> 01:04:30.619 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Camille k-a-m-i-l health
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
and in it the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
Court indicated that um
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
we cannot parental rights and
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and making
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
determinations of parental rights and
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is something that we
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
are statutorily authorized to do as
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
judges and we can't delegate that
 
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.049 align:start position:0%
judges and we can't delegate that
Authority

01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
so we can we can bring in or ask the
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
parties or order the parties to work
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
with a counselor or a parenting
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
coordinator but what we can't do is say
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
and that parenting coordinator's
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
decision is final on on any particular
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
issue there are some jurisdictions I
 
01:05:10.859 --> 01:05:11.650 align:start position:0%
issue there are some jurisdictions I
think

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:11.660 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
that Minnesota is one of them they use
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
something called a parenting time
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
expediter which is I as far as I can
 
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:22.940 align:start position:0%
tell akin to a parenting coordinator
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
and they have the ability to make
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
binding decisions like that I don't
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
think that our at least under that case
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
that's just come down not just but 2020
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's recent to me
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
um says from the Supreme our Supreme
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
Court says that we can't delegate that
 
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.890 align:start position:0%
Court says that we can't delegate that
responsibility

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I did see in the report
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
that you were actually referencing
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
um from 19 years ago the recommendation
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
to have a parenting coordinator so I did
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
actually put in a bill regarding that
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it it was
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense of the parties agreeing to
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
go which came which was recommended from
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
several family law attorneys well if you
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
want the parties to go in and agree but
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
you also you're going to want to keep
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the information confidential otherwise
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
the parties are never going to agree to
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
be using this if whatever they're saying
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
can kind of be used against them which
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
is I think the flip of kind of what
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
happens with the gal model but I guess
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about one thing with the gal
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
model that I've heard come up a lot and
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it may end up happening
 
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:26.420 align:start position:0%
with the parenting coordinator model
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
overall with the number of cases that
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
you've seen do you see
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
um cases being swayed one way or the
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
other when a party when one of the
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
parties is paying for the gal and the
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
other isn't because I'm wondering if the
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
same may become true and the parenting
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
coordinator model and I guess I know
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be kind of an anecdotal
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
question but I'd really love your
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
opinion on that because you probably
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
know which party's paying for it and you
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
probably know the outcome of many of
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
these reports
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a very good question
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I I'm aware that many people feel
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
that way I think that
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
um we start it would ideally be that in
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
every case if there's to be a guardian
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
ad litem appointed the parties can both
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
afford it and we would have them share
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
equally in that expense then everyone
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
has the same stake in the process I
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
think and then you know I I I think that
 
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.010 align:start position:0%
think and then you know I I I think that
would

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
would
um

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
we would hear much less of that
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
sentiment in that case however
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
what often or what sometimes will happen
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
one parent will want a Guardian outline
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be appointed the other parent will
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
not or cannot afford it or one parent
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
may be the parent that for which a
 
01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem is really necessary
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
because perhaps that parent is the one
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
who wants to move with the child
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
across the country to and and that would
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
severely impact the amount of parenting
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
time that the other parent would have
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
with that child if that were to occur
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
but you need to have someone that can
 
01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
look into the school system there and
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
what the housing would be there and do
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
that kind of investigation that a
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem can do that the court
 
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.710 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem can do that the court
cannot

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
and but that party
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
um the person who is not moving might
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
say well
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
she ought to be responsible for 100 of
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
that Guardian Ad Litem expense then
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
because that's the reason why it's
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
necessary in the first place and
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
if you look at the statute there is one
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the factors that we are to consider
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
when appointing a guardian ad litem
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
um is who is requesting it in addition
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
to what the finances of the parties are
 
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
it it's very difficult if both parties
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
cannot afford it
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
to appoint a guardian ad litem
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
if it's really if if we determine that
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
boy this case really needs a guardian ad
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
litem this child or children really need
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
to have a guardian ad litem in this case
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to present this type of
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
information to the court so that we can
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
truly or or better try to make a
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
determination of what's in their best
 
01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
determination of what's in their best
interests

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
interests
 
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
interests
um

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
at times if that happens and the only
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
way it can happen is because one parent
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
can afford to pay more of maybe 75
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
percent or even 100 percent of that
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
expense the other party cannot afford it
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
but that's the only way you can have the
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem in the case
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
what sometimes will happen is the person
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
that is not paying for it may complain
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
that the guardian ad litem is is really
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
working for that other party I can
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
understand how they might feel that way
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
or what also sometimes happens is that
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the party that's not paying for the
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem may be having the
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem's ear all of the time
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and sending thousands of text messages
 
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:57.620 align:start position:0%
and screenshots and evidence
 
01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:00.500 align:start position:0%
to help the guardian ad litem understand
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
what is going on in the case and then I
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
hear the party that is paying for it
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
complaining well you know he or she
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
ought to be paying more because they're
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
taking up all you know that the only
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
reason the guardian items fee is so high
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
is because the other part
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a no-win situation really any
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
way you slice it we when we make the
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
initial determination of whether we're
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
even going to have a guardian and then
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to be responsible for paying
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
for it we have to look at all of those
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
factors we have to look at well do we
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
truly need one can the parties afford it
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
if one or both can't well both can't we
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
can't we can't appoint one if only one
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
can afford it or one can pay more than
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
we try to craft the order on appointment
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
of guardian ad litem in such a way at
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
least I do
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
that will perhaps limit the scope of the
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
investigation to just what I'm
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
interested in in finding information
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
about given what I've heard to that
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
point in the case as being the issues
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
involving the child or children
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
we can we can limit the scope of the
 
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.390 align:start position:0%
we can we can limit the scope of the
appointment

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
but ultimately I think that the same is
 
01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:14.179 align:start position:0%
true for guardian's ad litem
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
mediators perhaps parenting coordinators
 
01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.090 align:start position:0%
mediators perhaps parenting coordinators
attorneys

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:19.100 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:21.860 align:start position:0%
each of those types of professionals
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
involved in a case such as this
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
one party may be happy with that
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
professional and the other party maybe
 
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.649 align:start position:0%
professional and the other party maybe
not

01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
um that is as judge king said the nature
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
of the type of work that we're doing the
 
01:11:37.689 --> 01:11:37.699 align:start position:0%
nature of these cases
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
and it it may be
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
Justified it may not be
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
but it's these are the only resources
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
that we have at present and we can only
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
do what we're statutorily authorized to
 
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.610 align:start position:0%
do what we're statutorily authorized to
do

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative qatab thank
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
um so just to follow back up but are you
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
actually seeing that when one party is
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
paying versus the other that the
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
majority of orders are in favor of the
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
party that's paying or are you not
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
seeing that I can't say that I have ever
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
or that I've ever that anyone's brought
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
that to my attention
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the vice chair
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.910 align:start position:0%
we have uh
had

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
discuss for this committee
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
um issues
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
relating to a judge requiring
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
um in layman's charts that might not be
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
the technical term a mental health
 
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.390 align:start position:0%
the technical term a mental health
evaluation

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't question
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the need
 
01:13:01.689 --> 01:13:01.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
who has come to the court seeking
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory resolution
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
take the responsibility for
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
other expenses I mean it's I'm not I'm
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
not raising taxation without
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
representation issues here but um I'm
 
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.290 align:start position:0%
representation issues here but um I'm
wondering

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.209 align:start position:0%
wondering
where

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
in uh a fair and just system
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
we can require someone who was who
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
appears before you seeking help
 
01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.330 align:start position:0%
appears before you seeking help
to

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
take on the responsibility of a
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very challenging question
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
and it's a very that's all I ask no I I
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate I appreciate the question
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
we need to create a parenting plan
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interests of the
 
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interests of the
children

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.229 align:start position:0%
children
and

01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
we start with the premise that the child
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
or children should have
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
continuing frequent contact with each
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
parent so that they have because both
 
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
parents have equal natural inherent
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
rights to parent that child as they come
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
to the courthouse those are now
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
competing with one another
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
because they're now in court
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
and one or the other is presenting
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that the other
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
is somehow presenting a harm to the
 
01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.310 align:start position:0%
is somehow presenting a harm to the
child

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
that harm could take many different
 
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.550 align:start position:0%
that harm could take many different
forms

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
I have uh you know without I can't speak
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
to the facts of any pending cases of
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
course but in general terms
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
certainly over the many years that I've
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
been doing this there have been
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
occasions where a parent has a very
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
serious alcoholism problem very serious
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
substance abuse problem
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
may have been involved in motor vehicle
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
accidents may have been involving the
 
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:18.500 align:start position:0%
child in the accidents
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
or may have what appears to be very
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
serious mental health illness that
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
perhaps is not being treated or had been
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
treated but currently that party is not
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
treating as he or she has been
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by their Physicians
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
and it's how do we then if the parents
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
can't themselves agree upon a parenting
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
plan and how they're going to share
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
parenting time with that child or
 
01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.330 align:start position:0%
parenting time with that child or
children

01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
um create one
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
that will not present any danger of harm
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
if a parent
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
presents with if we have sufficient
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
enough evidence to believe that there is
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
a serious mental health issue or a
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
serious substance use issue or maybe one
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
the evidence is clear enough because the
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
the statute says it has to be clearly
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that it's detrimental to a
 
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.590 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that it's detrimental to a
child

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
um to order something other than
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
continuing frequent contact with both
 
01:16:28.739 --> 01:16:30.189 align:start position:0%
continuing frequent contact with both
parents

01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
how how do we
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
how do how do we not put guidelines in
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
place or do something to learn what
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the issue is so that if it can
 
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.330 align:start position:0%
exactly the issue is so that if it can
be

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
safe for that child
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be with that parent we can work that
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
into the parenting plan
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
so it it's it's similar to
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
um you know we judges will order where
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate supervised parenting
 
01:16:56.219 --> 01:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate supervised parenting
time

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
and as you know there there are now few
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
and far between but there are
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
supervision centers that provide these
 
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.090 align:start position:0%
supervision centers that provide these
services

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
um in cases where there is evidence of
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
of some some presentation of harm to a
 
01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
of some some presentation of harm to a
child

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough for that judge to
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
believe that the parenting time should
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
be supervised then it's ordered to be
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
supervised if we can put safeguards in
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
place that will protect the child
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can make orders that are in
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
that child's best interests so that if
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
possible that child can have as much
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
healthy safe time with each parent
 
01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
healthy safe time with each parent
um

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.010 align:start position:0%
um
then

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:39.020 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we have as an
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do only however if the
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
parties can afford it and I'm very very
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of that issue
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
if a parent is in front of us because
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're representing themselves often
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's because they cannot afford an
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
attorney to represent them and then if
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to add on that a guardian
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
ad litem expense counseling expense
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation expense perhaps
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm we all understand that that that is
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
something that may be insurmountable
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to do but we they
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
file a financial affidavit with us for
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
almost every hearing where there is
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
going to be some type of I I for
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
instance if someone asks me to appoint a
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem I cannot and won't do
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
it until they have both filed Financial
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
affidavits sworn to under oath that
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
explain to me what their financial
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
situation is so that I can determine if
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
they can afford it and how to allocate
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
it the same is with respect to the
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
counseling I mean I you know there may
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
be many many cases where I I would like
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
to have someone have a mental health
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation but I I don't order it
 
01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:42.980 align:start position:0%
because I they cannot afford it
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for a follow-up
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
I apologize I thought you had finished
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
one before I began to speak so go ahead
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
forgive me
 
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.850 align:start position:0%
forgive me
um

01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm very troubled
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
by this
 
01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.450 align:start position:0%
by this
um and

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
I want I want to ask two parts of this
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
if the chair would permit me to do that
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
let's forget about Australia or New
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
Zealand or Finland or Sweden I think
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
everybody's supposed to be happy
 
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
everybody's supposed to be happy
um

01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
where these issues are not before
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
a court
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
but are in another venue
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I believe I haven't studied every
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
state but I would
 
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
I would believe that every family court
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
in the United States is experiencing
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
these same issues these same
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
difficulties which have only been
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
exacerbated in recent years I think you
 
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:00.020 align:start position:0%
know the covid pandemic has has really
 
01:20:02.649 --> 01:20:02.659 align:start position:0%
created even more of a mental health
 
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:04.820 align:start position:0%
crisis I think
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
the chair asks the committee researcher
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
to get us some information as to whether
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
any other United States state
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
in family court has the same difficulty
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
of lack of funding or is there a state
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
that has considerable funding available
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
for GIS and some other things like that
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you my answer comes from my own
 
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.770 align:start position:0%
thank you my answer comes from my own
experience

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I I've been fortunate that the
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
conference that I attended this spring
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
there was a grant fortunately that
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
allowed me to go it was the association
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
of family and conciliation courts and it
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
was all it was a judge's conference and
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
there were judges there from all of the
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
United States and Beyond as I mentioned
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I spoke with many many other judges
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I and I saw presentations by many
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
judges from all over the United States
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
and what we were all finding is that we
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
are all experiencing or many of us I
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
should say are experiencing a lot of the
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
same a lot of the same challenges within
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
our family court systems do you wish to
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow up I in my mind for these months
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
is a comment that was made before this
 
01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:19.970 align:start position:0%
is a comment that was made before this
committee

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
to buy a one of your former colleagues
 
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.930 align:start position:0%
to buy a one of your former colleagues
um

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:28.940 align:start position:0%
Annette Gordon
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
who said that we have to understand that
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the Court
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
is not to solve the underlying problem
 
01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:45.709 align:start position:0%
is not to solve the underlying problem
and

01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
um I have over the years
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
whatever hat he was wearing at the time
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
she found Ned's comments to be astute
 
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.630 align:start position:0%
she found Ned's comments to be astute
um

01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
I recognize the correctness of what he
 
01:22:03.659 --> 01:22:04.610 align:start position:0%
I recognize the correctness of what he
said

01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
which causes me to say then what are we
 
01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:12.229 align:start position:0%
which causes me to say then what are we
doing

01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't see the answer are we in
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
fact helping
 
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.669 align:start position:0%
fact helping
families

01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.750 align:start position:0%
who are
experiencing

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.970 align:start position:0%
 
difficulties

01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:30.980 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
get to a point where although we're not
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
solving the problem
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
we are making it possible
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
for the state interest the state's
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
interest is not in the marriage that's a
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
business Arrangement it always has been
 
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.770 align:start position:0%
business Arrangement it always has been
for

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
you know since time began but in
 
01:22:51.179 --> 01:22:53.149 align:start position:0%
you know since time began but in
protecting

01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
children and is there
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
a better way
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
for us to protect
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer but that is
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm struggling with I I'd like to
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
answer and I'd like to have more
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
conversation with you about this because
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's something I am extremely interested
 
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's something I am extremely interested
in

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
finding out for myself I understand
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
intellectually I understand why
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
we have these cases before us I
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
understand that the state has a parent's
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
Patriot power when minor children are
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
involved and that is why when parents
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
who have these equal natural inherent
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
rights to parent their children under
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
the Constitution when they are at
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
conflict when they are at odds with each
 
01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
conflict when they are at odds with each
other

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
um why then we are
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
employed to
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
settle that dispute so to speak and then
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
the question is how do we do that and
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to do that
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
of course we have to do we have to be
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
guided by the statutes by by our the
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
legislation that that we have that
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
enables us to do what we do the case law
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
that comes down from our Supreme Court
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
certainly which interprets that and and
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
helps us in what we do
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
But ultimately it's apparent in case a
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
divorce case with children or a
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
parenting case is extraordinarily
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
different than any other type of case
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we see within the circuit court or
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
that the Superior Court sees and
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
and it's it's different for a myriad of
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't need to explain to you
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
you all understand why
 
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
um and so it doesn't fit as neatly
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um perhaps
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and it isn't as easy I would argue to
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
be a judge on these types of cases as in
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
say you know every once in a while when
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
I was on the regular docket of the
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court I I would have to sit in
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
District Division and do criminal
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
arraignments and and things of that
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
nature and sometimes I did the Civil
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
docket and I heard small claims actions
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
and and payment hearings and I I looked
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
forward to those days they were a nice
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
break because these are difficult
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
difficult cases judge lemir I'm going to
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
have to break in now with others going
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be called forward
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
um on October 17th which is a Tuesday at
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
10 30 a.m the subcommittee slash work
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
group of the special committee will be
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of gal and
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
parenting plans and all of that it's the
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
only subgroup I don't have in my notes
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
as to who's on it
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
anybody here or the clerk has is my
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
external memory stick so I'm chairing it
 
01:25:55.199 --> 01:25:56.149 align:start position:0%
external memory stick so I'm chairing it
and

01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it'll be rep long rep Greg and rep
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
wanza are also on it and who else Greg
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
and long and lonza Lanza okay so the
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
four of you
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
um will be addressing this issue and uh
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
I don't Mr chair for indulging my
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
philosophical and I would just suggest
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
that your other training might come in
 
01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:23.219 align:start position:0%
here where perhaps the answer is to say
 
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
I have two day jobs one of them is an
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
Episcopal priest of a small Church the
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
second one is part-time Chief Executive
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
Officer of a Wellness Center that has
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
counselors and Family Practice
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians so yes and I'm sorry if I
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
spoke long on the issue but no that's
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
fine I very much appreciate Vice uh
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
chair Smith's um
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're your interest I was going
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
to say would it be appropriate for the
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
members of the special committee work
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
group to
 
01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:00.950 align:start position:0%
group to
um

01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
use you as a further resource I I would
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
be happy to have any opportunity to help
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
if there is a way that we can improve
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
upon what we already have in a way that
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
that helps us as judges but more
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
importantly helps the families and
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
children that appear before us so it
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
won't go on to the broadcast recording
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
if you would either if you're here when
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
we adjourn you can do it in person if
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
you have to leave could you leave
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
whatever contact information you are
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to give them with the researcher
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they will check with her I'd be
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
happy to okay thank you so much thank
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
brief

01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
not a legal brief just a short just a
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
brief brief okay uh thank you Mr
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I yeah I just uh yeah I would
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
like that contact information I have a
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
lot of questions on the gal in parenting
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
um that I'll reserve for uh when I have
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
a conversation with you
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
um but as we were talking is this
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
is this 95 or more
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
just the high conflict or is some of
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
this tied into the 80 percent of the
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
nine months that
 
01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.629 align:start position:0%
nine months that
um

01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
get resolved is it I no doubt there is
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
some of it tied into the other eighty
 
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.770 align:start position:0%
some of it tied into the other eighty
percent

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
but where we see the most need
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
um are the cases that do last the
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
longest that um that they they just they
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have the expertise the mental
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
health expertise and what have you to
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
really therapeutically help these
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
families the way that they they may need
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
in addition to helping them as much as I
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
can in the legal context okay thank you
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all very much
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
and judge king who would you like to
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
present before
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
would be next to talk about the Rules of
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
Evidence I just wanted
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair Smith to know that I'll
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
get this in the right order Senator
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
judge representative now referee Ned
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
Gordon did four nces for us last week
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
and I believe all four settled so he's
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
doing a great job in his new role as a
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluator for the circuit
 
01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:27.380 align:start position:0%
board doesn't surprise and the chair
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes judge mace
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
and before you begin sir the
 
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:34.669 align:start position:0%
and before you begin sir the
um

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
this committee is considering the
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
question of Rules of Evidence
 
01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
there are two bills before another
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee I chair children and family
 
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.629 align:start position:0%
committee I chair children and family
law

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a stroke of
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
um Insanity I appointed the same people
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
to both groups because
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the house said we could not
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
have a joint meeting so we cannot have a
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
joint meeting of the five of us what we
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
can have is a meeting on a two retained
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
bills on Rules of Evidence in family
 
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
court with Pearson and the chair ball
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
McMahon Greg and long who amazingly then
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
will remember what we did when we think
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
about it here
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
so that session will be I think it is on
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
October 10th next Tuesday in this room
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
children and family law Rules of
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
Evidence Pearson McMahon who sends his
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
regrets he had a family health issue so
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can Mark him excused long Greg and
 
01:30:42.129 --> 01:30:42.139 align:start position:0%
ball so with that the chair recognizes
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
judge mace this by the way is what a
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
paper printout of the Rules of Evidence
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
look like I didn't bring my own copy and
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
thanks to the Supreme Court for giving
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
me a huge stack the commonality of which
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
is LexisNexis which apparently I'm
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
signed up for now
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and that has been read four times
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
with the footnotes and even some
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
cross-referencing to all those books who
 
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
live over there so bring it on Rules of
 
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.390 align:start position:0%
live over there so bring it on Rules of
Evidence

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I sincerely
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to address
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
this body I I am a circuit court judge
 
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:22.940 align:start position:0%
as you know I sit in the Franklin
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court uh it's hard to believe
 
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
now but I'm entering my sixth year as a
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
judge in October of this year uh before
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
that I was a civil litigator for
 
01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 years uh 10 of which
 
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
were devoted almost exclusively to
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
family law in New Hampshire and in
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
Vermont I practiced in the Upper Valley
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
and apropov our discussion today about
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
evidence I thought it uh wise to point
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
out at the outset that when I practiced
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
family law I practice family law in New
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in Vermont and in Vermont
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
the formal Rules of Evidence apply to
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
those proceedings so I have quite a lot
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
of experience in both settings and I can
 
01:32:04.689 --> 01:32:04.699 align:start position:0%
I can tell you uh with uh near 100
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
certainty that the general tenor of the
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
litigation that judge Lemire so
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
eloquently described does not change
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
whether or not the rules apply or not
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so as a preferatory comment we're
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
still dealing with families in crisis
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
families who are going through trauma
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that is filtered to
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
us through the through the Rules of
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
Evidence or not
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
um is is not uh terribly apparent to me
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
at least uh so what I thought I would do
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh for the committee if it uh if it
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
pleases you is I I wanted you to First
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
be aware if you're not of exactly what
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases we hear in the Family
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
Division what Rules of Evidence apply to
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
those subcategories and what burdens of
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
proof we have to deal with because those
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
are all relevant when we talk about the
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence it matters greatly
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
what type of case we're talking about
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
and it matters greatly what the actual
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is in a particular case
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
type so the Family Division here is of
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
course divorce and parenting cases judge
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
Lemire was addressing those we hear
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases I think there
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
were some questions of judge king and
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley about how those are filed
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
we hear guardianship cases for juvenile
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
animals we hear abuse and neglect cases
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
brought by the division of children
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
youth and families for children who are
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
suspected of being abused or neglected
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
we hear termination of parental rights
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
cases we hear delinquency cases and we
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
hear Chin's cases of course chins is an
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
acronym for child in need of services so
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
in each case type we have a series of
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
rules and statutes that tell us what
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
sort of evidentiary territory we're in
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
starting with divorce and parenting we
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a family division rule 2.2 that
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
tells us the rules of evidence do not
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
apply it does not mean they don't exist
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
it just means that we can apply them
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
when they would enhance quote the
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
predictable orderly fair and reliable
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
presentation of evidence so rule 2.1 of
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
the Family Division rule tells us that
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
those apply to divorce and parenting
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
cases turning to domestic violence cases
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
those of course are parties seeking
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
protective orders uh against the
 
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:17.300 align:start position:0%
existence of a protected relationship
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
marriage child in common uh
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
people related by blood or affinity and
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
the like the rules exist and what that
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
statute is RSA 173 B3 Roman 8. the rules
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
exist but they're relaxed which means
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
that we're not bound by the technical
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence the burden of proof in
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
those cases is preponderance so you have
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
to understand that when we're reviewing
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
these cases the rules do apply they are
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
relaxed but it's preponderance in other
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
words it's a more likely than not
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
standard but there would be a ruling as
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
to each particular bit of evidence
 
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.070 align:start position:0%
to each particular bit of evidence
offered

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
offered
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh typically yes uh if if they're
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
conducted like most hearings you would
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
expect to be conducted we have three
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
General categories of evidence we're
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
looking for in a domestic violence case
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking for first and foremost the
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
existence of a protected relationship
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
under 173b we're looking for a
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
prohibited act which is enumerated in
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
173 but it really mirrors uh some of the
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
sections of our criminal code and then
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
of course the third prong which is the
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
most difficult is whether or not they
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
responded in a case like that represents
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
a present credible threat to the
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
petitioner's safety so it's it's in
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
those three categories that that
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
evidence would fall it's almost never
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
contested that there's a there's a
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
protected relationship it's generally
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious this is a married couple
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is a couple with a child in common
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
this is uh an adult with a you know
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
another adult child for example that
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
would be a consequinity relationship uh
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that we don't really get into too
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
much trouble there in terms of evidence
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
it can get a little more complicated
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the prohibited
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
action yeah and I would I would add
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
importantly it's really critical to note
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
and and I think representative Smith you
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
touched upon this or for forgive me it
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
might have been uh representative qatab
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
when you uh referenced someone seeking
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
relief in another case type it is often
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
the case that someone who is a
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
respondent in a domestic violence action
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
is also going to be a defendant and a
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
parallel criminal case so it's best
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
practices and we generally follow this
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
before we allow respondents to testify
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
in these cases we give them a general
 
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment warning they are public
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
recorded proceedings and anything they
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
say on that record could be used against
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
them in a separate criminal proceeding
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's important for getting the rules
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
of evidence for a minute that you've
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
given that General constitutional
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
warning because we are going to be
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
talking about evidence on the record it
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
is a lower evidentiary threshold but it
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
is still alive proceeding and we need to
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that defendants that appear in
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
those cases are mindful that they may be
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
putting themselves into criminal
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy by testifying uh the next
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
category of cases is guardianships these
 
01:36:59.209 --> 01:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
are juveniles or minors that are without
 
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate parental care or supervision
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's generally the same evidentiary
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
standard that we apply in domestic
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
violence cases we apply RSA 463 eight
 
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
Roman one again the rules apply but
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
we're not bound by their technical
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
application there are two types of
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
burdens of proof and guardianship cases
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
of this stripe if it's a guardianship
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
brought by grandparents because of a of
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or it's agreed that in
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
other words by consent guardianship is
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
necessary the burden of proof is
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence if it's
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
contested it's clear and convincing
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
evidence so it's that evidential burden
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
that exists between preponderance and
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt so that
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
we we again in these cases we're not
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
bound by the technical rules they apply
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
but if it's contested we're looking at a
 
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
much higher evidentiary burden that
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
typically means as a fact finder looking
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
at the Rules of Evidence we're going to
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
be a little more on top of what we might
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
let in under a relaxed standard because
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof is higher in other
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
words it needs to be generally more
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
reliable according to the legislature uh
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
turning to abuse and neglect cases these
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
are brought by dcyf against parents and
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
Guardians for the suspected abuse and
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
neglect of a child we are looking at
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
evidence from a statute it's 169 C 12.
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
that again is telling us that the rules
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
are relaxed there's one exception in
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
that statute that's important to note if
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
the division brings forward prior and
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm looking right through this
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
speaker at you I'm trying not to ignore
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
you uh that if the division brings prior
 
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
assessments or prior reports to
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a pattern of conduct the
 
01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:39.179 align:start position:0%
statute actually makes the admission of
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
those reports mandatory there's a shell
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
in that statute and that's an important
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
evidential consideration because those
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
documents and I can tell you with lots
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
and lots of experience judge Ashley far
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
more they are wrecked with hearsay
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
evidence it is almost all hearsay but
 
01:38:57.649 --> 01:38:57.659 align:start position:0%
those come in if offered to demonstrate
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
a pattern irrespective of whether the
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
rules apply or not so that's something
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
we have to Grapple with as well the next
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
section is tpr's termination of parental
 
01:39:09.370 --> 01:39:09.380 align:start position:0%
rights those are broad pursuant to 170c
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about uh
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh the same sort of evidentiary approach
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
but there are two what I find to be uh
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
distinctive features from an evidentiary
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
perspective about those case types uh in
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
particular the right we're talking about
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
the termination of parental rights is is
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
the most severe sanction I think we can
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
issue uh as Circuit Court judges it's
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
the one we all fear the most it is the
 
01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:37.580 align:start position:0%
most serious we're talking talking about
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
severing a fundamental parental liberty
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
interest that has existed and has been
 
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
recognized by courts across the country
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
for centuries it's embodied in Troxel
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
versus Granville which is a U.S Supreme
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
Court on point so when we're dealing
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
with the burden of proof it is proof
 
01:39:55.129 --> 01:39:55.139 align:start position:0%
Beyond a reasonable doubt we apply the
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
same burden of proof that we do to a
 
01:39:59.890 --> 01:39:59.900 align:start position:0%
murder case because we are talking about
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
divesting someone of a fundamental
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
parental liberty interest for time and
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
memorium so it's it's important to
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
recognize that we're in that subcategory
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
of cases we are dealing with proof
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt the statute
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
that apply applies to how we view
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
evidence also has some mandatory
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
language about confrontation so if
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
someone is going to be testifying to a
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
report that they've made they need to be
 
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
on the witness stand and testifying live
 
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we do have some discretion about what
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
we are going to let in but the
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislature has told us quite clearly we
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
are at the the highest evidentiary
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
burden in those cases and the the
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
testifying Witnesses need to be
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
testifying they're alive to what they've
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
observed not necessarily repeating what
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
stated in a report
 
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.030 align:start position:0%
stated in a report
I

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
turning lastly to two uh somewhat
 
01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:50.699 align:start position:0%
related case types we have 169 B which
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
is our delinquency code and we have 169
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
D Delta which is our chins statute so
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
the delinquency code you can think more
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
or less of our code of criminal
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
procedure for juveniles the formal Rules
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
of Evidence do apply it is proof Beyond
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
A Reasonable Doubt and it's generally
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the same for chins although in Chin's
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
cases we typically see a lot of evidence
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
coming in without objection because in
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
those cases we're typically solely
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
focused on the welfare of a child and
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's usually brought I wouldn't say all
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
the time by agreement but it does come
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
in Often by agreement or by stipulation
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
or what we call a plea of true if it's
 
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
not we do have the same evidentiary
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
burden of proof it is proof Beyond A
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt so that is generally
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
speaking on what we encounter in terms
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
of the rules of evidence and the burdens
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
of proof across each case type I wanted
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
to make that clear before I started
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
taking questions because what I've just
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
listed with divorce and parenting
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence guardianships abuse
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
and neglect termination of parental
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
rights cases delinquency and Chin's
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
cases those are a day in the life and
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
the Family Division and so you can see
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to shift gears all day long
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
between different evidentiary standards
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
and different burdens proof and so it
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
can get a little murky if we're not
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
clear about what case type we're talking
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
about page 15 of Rules of Evidence say
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
that evidence may be excluded if it's
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
probative value is substantially
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the danger of prejudice or
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
confusion is that whole does that hold
 
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
all through your list or are there items
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
on there where
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
weight is given a little bit more one
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
way or the other I would say as a
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
general proposition that sets all the
 
01:42:37.129 --> 01:42:37.139 align:start position:0%
way through I I think that the
 
01:42:37.139 --> 01:42:38.689 align:start position:0%
way through I I think that the
difference

01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to make a
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
distinction between the application of
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
that rule
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
in front of a jury and a judge sitting
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
as Judge Andrew the danger of unfair
 
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
Prejudice I think my opinion is lessened
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
because we're trained we're trained
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
lures and we're judges we understand
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
that someone may be throwing an exhibit
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
in to try to inflame the Trier fact as
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
judge Lemire discussed in these cases we
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
see lots of inflammatory evidence and
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
we're very unlikely to be swayed by
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
something that would be outweighing its
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
probative value the comment of the jury
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
will disregard what you just heard
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
sure they will right I typically say
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative long
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
judge

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so you refer to a lot of the rules uh
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
has relaxed uh is is there a definition
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
of relaxed yes it the the definition is
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
actually from this body it is that the
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
technical Rules of Evidence don't apply
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the technical
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
application of the Rules of Evidence you
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
can think of I heard someone was a fan
 
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
of Law and Order uh you can you can
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
think of how these these rules would be
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
applied in a criminal case in other
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
words someone would make a hearsay
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
objection or object to a form of
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
character evidence of or bad ax evidence
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh someone would be there trying to uh
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
you think of a tax fraud case they'd I'd
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
be presenting a summary of voluminous
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
exhibits and the documents wouldn't be
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom so if let's take that
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
last example if I was technically
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
applying the rules of evidence and I'm
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
an expert accountant and I'm handing you
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet if the backup
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
documentation is in the courtroom it's
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
not coming in
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the technical application I'm
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
I am standing on this book saying that's
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
what the rule says relaxing it uh would
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
be let's say it would happen and like
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
the complex uh uh asset cases that judge
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
Lemire referred to are a great example
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
if we have a closely held family
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
Corporation for example we have
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
voluminous exhibits we've got lots of
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
tax returns bank statements QuickBook
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
printouts and the like sometimes the
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers will agree that the summaries
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
can come in without the exhibits being
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
in the room so I can relax that
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
technical application and by stipulation
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's one example of what it means to
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
relax the technical application of the
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
rule that's right thank you I would like
 
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
to read
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
um into the
 
01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.830 align:start position:0%
um into the
um

01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
recording the reporters notes to rule
 
01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
recording the reporters notes to rule
102.

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
102.
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
and also it says New Hampshire is
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
identical to the corresponding Federal
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
rule this is reporters notes rule 102. I
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
I don't have a Pages six and seven the
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
philosophical underpinnings of these
 
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:27.410 align:start position:0%
philosophical underpinnings of these
rules

01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
which are a to prefer the pursuit of
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
General normative goals to the strict
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
construction of inflexible technical
 
01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.689 align:start position:0%
construction of inflexible technical
rules

01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
B to permit the Court's sufficient
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
latitude to fairly decide issues where
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
strictly constructed rules would tend to
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
compete or conflict and see to favor the
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
pursuit of the truth in a fair and just
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
determination of issues over fastidious
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
adheritance to the letter of codified or
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
common law that pretty well
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
says it to me I mean there's more
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
statements further on in in Rules of
 
01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
Evidence but that seems to me the big
 
01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
ballpark of why in Family Court The
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence do not have to
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
strictly apply and I think if we're
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
looking at this from a purely practical
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
perspective if we're forgetting all of
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
the statutes that I reference about the
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
varying uh evidentiary standards and
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
burdens of proof If we think about best
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
interests of the child that that is a
 
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
pervasive theme through all of the case
 
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
types that I I've just referenced in
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
during my testimony it is particularly
 
01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:38.930 align:start position:0%
during my testimony it is particularly
cute

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
cute
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh any best best interest determination
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
we need to make an abuse neglect case in
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
cases and termination of parental rights
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
cases and it's important to recognize
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
that our Supreme Court has uh
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
differentiated between the proof Beyond
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
a reasonable doubt that the dcyf must uh
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
prove Beyond a reason without the
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
contents of the petition or if it's a
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
private lit again the same standard but
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
that that the concept of best interest
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the child is not it in and of itself
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
an evidentiary fact it's an examination
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
of possible outcomes that are most
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
optimal for the child and were
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
instructed to give those priority so in
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
a sense we can't really get at that
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
determination if we're applying these
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
rules because we're not actually trying
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
to establish matters of fact we're
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
trying to weigh outcomes for children so
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
it makes sense if you look at it from
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
that framing that we wouldn't be bound
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily by the technical rules if
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get at the heart of a
 
01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:37.100 align:start position:0%
best interest determination
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
the two retained builds that was
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
submitted several months ago but I would
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
ask my committee to retain them because
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
I knew this was about to happen
 
01:47:48.119 --> 01:47:48.709 align:start position:0%
I knew this was about to happen
um

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
spoke to issues of
 
01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:55.940 align:start position:0%
uh why does the judge keep admitting
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept this this evidence
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
this evidence that evidence that
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
evidence all it's doing is unnecessarily
 
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
delaying and I'm looking at um
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
um rule 403 the court May exclude
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
relevant evidence if the probative value
 
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
is substantially outweighed by undue
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
delay wasting time
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
needlessly presenting cumulative
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
evidence evidence that does not add to
 
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
what is being considered so there is a
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
question that those those are relative
 
01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:36.980 align:start position:0%
terms undo is is not an objective thing
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
so how then would uh Family Division of
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court take a look at issues
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
where some would say too much evidence
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
is being admitted in violation of rule
 
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
is being admitted in violation of rule
403

01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
403
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's an excellent question
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
um beginning with some advice I got from
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
a a mentor who is a excellent trial or
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately not with us anymore
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
she told me it was my former law partner
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
that if you're getting everything in
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
you're in big trouble
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
in other words if everything you're
 
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
trying to offer as evidence is coming
 
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
into evidence it's not really mattering
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily to the judge
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
that little quip aside I will say that
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
that is one of the more difficult tasks
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have uh and and I'll my sense of why
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's difficult is that when we're in
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases in
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
particular we're talking about the two
 
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
things that are more important to us
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
people than anything else that is our
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
children and the fruits of our Labor uh
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
so you are going to try your level best
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
to try to tell the judge everything you
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
can think of to hang on to those two
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
things that is a very understandable
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
human instinct we try to be
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
compassionate about that but we have
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
very very compact long dockets you heard
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
judge king tell you about how little
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
time we have to hear these cases so that
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
is one of those gray areas where we just
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
have to make a gut call discretionary
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
decision on the record often that we
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
need to cut off a line of questioning
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
because we've heard someone say this
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
parent is a good parent they bring it in
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
other witness this parent is a good
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
parent they bring in another witness
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
this parent is a good parent if we did
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
all trials like that divorcing couples
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
would line up 57 neighbors long and we'd
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
have month-long trials about a parenting
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
case we obviously can't do that so it is
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
one of those areas I just don't have a
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
good answer for you representative
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
Pearson I what I what I can tell you is
 
01:50:38.159 --> 01:50:39.129 align:start position:0%
Pearson I what I what I can tell you is
that

01:50:39.129 --> 01:50:39.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
ideally the judge that's hearing the
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
case has trial experience and
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
understands uh the limits of relevance
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and when it's kind of getting a little
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
long in the tooth and I've it's been my
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
practice and I'm sure it's been judges
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
Kings Ashley and lemire's practice that
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
if you've gotten the point you can tell
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
Council or the pro se litigant I've
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
heard you I'm inclined to find that you
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
have a number of people that are willing
 
01:51:07.609 --> 01:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
to say x y or Z so there's no bright
 
01:51:09.169 --> 01:51:09.179 align:start position:0%
line there but it is something we need
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
to be mindful from and that is really a
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
Time conservation question and I think
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
that's right in 403 representative
 
01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:17.219 align:start position:0%
Pearson I think that's that's
 
01:51:17.219 --> 01:51:18.770 align:start position:0%
Pearson I think that's that's
accumulation

01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
accumulation
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative catab
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
um I have a kind of two questions in in
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
one so regarding
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
um civil domestic violence cases that
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
are not criminal yet are constitutional
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
warnings required at all and then also
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
How does Discovery work and domestic
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
violence cases those are both excellent
 
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
questions uh so the warning I don't
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
believe is required I'm unaware of a
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
mandate that we have as judges to issue
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
that warning I find it just best
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
practices and I know a lot of my
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
colleagues share the same that in the
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
Family Division in particular it is very
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
common for us to see three cases
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
co-occur a divorce and parenting case a
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
civil domestic violence case and a
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
district court criminal case involving
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
the same parties because we sometimes
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
know that's out there and I think you
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
heard that it's not exactly an exact
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
science that we are going to be aware of
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
all three case types at any given time
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
but because there is the possibility of
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination there is a fifth
 
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:26.420 align:start position:0%
amendment implication
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
we are the stewards of the Constitution
 
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
and the courtroom and personally
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
speaking I think it's important to try
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
to uphold those rights whenever we are
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
aware of them and can articulate them
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
and so if someone particularly an
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
unrepresented party is sitting there and
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
facing criminal charges as well it I
 
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
don't think hurts to say
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
you know you might consider you have a
 
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
fifth minute right Fifth Amendment right
 
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
against self-incrimination it does leave
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
them in a terrible spot because having
 
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
said that they're going to have to elect
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
typically by themselves without a lawyer
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
whether they want to defend against it
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so I typically say look you are
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to be in this position I'm going
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
to take this petition is uncontroverted
 
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
if you don't testify but it is your
 
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
right not to and it's at least important
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that right so I don't
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's a mandate but I believe
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's best practices to do they answer
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but I guess the part that I'm
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
we are taking away somebody's Liberties
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
right in that process of doing so and
 
01:53:28.729 --> 01:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
then we're kind of binding them well
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
okay you can choose to testify against
 
01:53:34.129 --> 01:53:34.139 align:start position:0%
yourself if you want or not but we're
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
also I mean there is a constitutional
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
requirement if we're going to take away
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
somebody's Liberties that we are going
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
to give them an attorney if they can't
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
afford one also so do we do we offer
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
that ever in the civil cases or we don't
 
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
we do not we are not authorized to offer
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
that in civil cases for the same reason
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
we're not authorized to give divorcing
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
parents lawyers it's a civil proceeding
 
01:53:57.649 --> 01:53:57.659 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned uh you know I I maybe
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't make it clear enough but I do
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
try to acknowledge that very difficult
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
position that that litigan's going to
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
find hemores helps him or herself in
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is that you you know you may be
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
deprived of a liberty interest I to
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
preserve a Fifth Amendment right in a
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
criminal case and it's a it's an awful
 
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
position to be in as a litigant I
 
01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize that but we don't
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
have the statutory authorization to get
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
around that it just exists follow-up
 
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
if a party so I know that there is a
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
clause uh allowing under the rules that
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
if somebody is of good character that
 
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
they could be allowed to
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say represent somebody
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
but be allowed to to go to court with
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
somebody and that's at the judge's
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
discretion so typically if somebody
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to have to testify against
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
themselves because there's a there's a
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
fifth amendment issue would you
 
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.490 align:start position:0%
fifth amendment issue would you
typically

01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh Grant somebody's petition to allow
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
somebody of good character to speak on
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
their behalf uh so let me make sure I
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand the question because it's an
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
interesting one so if I'm a respondent
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a domestic violence case in other
 
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
words someone's brought one against me
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I bring
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
a third party to speak for me
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
what is the third party telling me
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
I guess that's my question
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
so I think they'd be able to at least
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
ask questions of the other person and
 
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
point out things that are into evidence
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
without actually testifying because they
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
can say according to this report XYZ but
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're not testifying that that's
 
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
actually true versus
 
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
when the person's doing it themselves
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're kind of implying that they're
 
01:55:34.609 --> 01:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
testing for that right and that's an
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
important Nuance point and I neglected
 
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
to mention that you can cross-examine
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
the petitioner as the defendant and not
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
waive your fifth amendment rights when I
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
see Pro seis do that I still give them
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
that warning because they may
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
inadvertently incriminate themselves in
 
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
the way they ask a question so sometimes
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
when you ask a question on
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
cross-examination you need to embed the
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
question with particular facts that you
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
want discussed
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's tricky if you really don't know
 
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
how uh how cross-examination works so
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
the the answer is yes you you can
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
preserve your fifth amendment rights and
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
still ask the petitioner questions it is
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
of course far better to let a lawyer do
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
that uh but it's not always the case
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
that we have that luxury in fact it's
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that has been raised
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
to Children and Family Law is the judge
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
made an error in admitting that piece of
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
evidence and again rule 103 you've got
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
to say you're honor I object and if I'm
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
not mistaken why what is the nature of
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
the objection and I don't like it isn't
 
01:56:45.719 --> 01:56:47.109 align:start position:0%
the objection and I don't like it isn't
valid

01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
valid
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
but it has to be done that or or in a
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
timely manner I think yes and if the
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
error is in admitting the evidence the
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
party objects in a timely matter with a
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
motion to strike and gives the grounds
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
if the era is an excluding of evidence
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
the party informs the court of the
 
01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
substance of the evidence and why it
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
should be admitted but that has to be
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
done in real time it does have to be
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
done therefore if it is not You've Lost
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
That Right should it be appealed
 
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.530 align:start position:0%
That Right should it be appealed
um

01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
the evidence is is still part of what's
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
being passed on that's a more nuanced
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
question I I think that we're talking
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
about two things we may be talking about
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
preserving the objection and preserving
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
the issue for appeal and then on the
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
other hand plain error uh that that even
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
though someone may not have preserved a
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
particular objection they might have
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
just said objection and maybe the judge
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
just waved It Off
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
if it was still plain error that it came
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
in it can still be addressed by the
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court but it is best practices
 
01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
again to have that discussion with the
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
litigant objecting on the record about
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
what the objection is it's incredibly
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
difficult I'll say it that way I'll use
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
that strong language with Pro Se
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
litigants who don't know the rules of
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
evidence they may be saying I am jacked
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's my experience it's often the case
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
that the objection is a disagreement
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's not actually an objection but if it
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
is an objection you need to try to
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
assess out what they're objecting to in
 
01:58:13.729 --> 01:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
terms of its form and then trying to
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
make a ruling on the record and if the
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
judge makes an error that reasonable
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
parties would conclude was an error on
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
the part of a judge if it's a harmless
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
error that doesn't affect the decision
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
the decision would have gone the same
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
way irrespective then that does not
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
poison things that is the harmless error
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
standard correct okay correct but it is
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
the case that the Supreme Court can
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
always look at an evidentiary ruling be
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
made in overrules of Iran now here's my
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
big ask okay
 
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:43.820 align:start position:0%
because I've got to preside over
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
to retain build hearings
 
01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
that are coming at The Rules of Evidence
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
it seems to me from some of what we've
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
been saying today and some other things
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
we've been saying at other times
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
better instruction of pro se litigants
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
might be in order because
 
01:59:06.169 --> 01:59:06.179 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't have known these things
 
01:59:06.179 --> 01:59:07.070 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't have known these things
um

01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:09.659 align:start position:0%
but people who are going to court and
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
object and the objection is incorrect
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's not timely or it's not given reason
 
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
for may not understand that wouldn't
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
they be hoped if in their own Pro Se
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
preparation there was more information
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
than provided I've not looked at the the
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
videos I've not read the documents yet
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me from the hearings
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we've been conducting nobody knew
 
01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
how would you think that might play out
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I I think more information is
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
always better this is designed to help
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
us get at truth that's fundamentally
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
what this is and so if we can if we can
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
better educate people that are appearing
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
before us about how these apply in what
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
cases they apply to what degree they
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
apply what burdens of proof they have
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
um that is I think going to be in All
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
Ships rise situation
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that there's any harm in
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
that at all uh
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence are difficult even
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
for lawyers but but more information is
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
always better
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
let me go further did you did you have a
 
02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:23.330 align:start position:0%
let me go further did you did you have a
question

02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:24.229 align:start position:0%
question
okay

02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
the separation of powers because the
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
legislature is making some
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
we guess laws affecting the Judiciary so
 
02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
page 78
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
um opinion of the justices
 
02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.490 align:start position:0%
um opinion of the justices
1997

02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:42.500 align:start position:0%
1997
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
page 78. the legislature has no more
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
right to break down The rules prescribed
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
by the court to assure fundamental due
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
process in criminal and civil court
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
trials than the court has to prescribe
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
the moon and manner in which the
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
legislature shall perform its
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
legislative duties wow
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to see where the line is
 
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
um reporters notes on rule 501 which is
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
as as you know the section on privileged
 
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
testimony I qualify under 502 medical
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
and 505 clergy so I'm really on that
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
section but the reporters note on 501
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
which is the introductory section to
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
that page 97 says although the principal
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
statutory privilege recognizes the
 
02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
inherent right of the legislature to
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
deal with such matters Provisions have
 
02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
been made established in the rules
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
um in the rules the saving for statutory
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
privileges is that just for the 500
 
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
section or is that for everything
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to put what I see is
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
possibly contradictory statements about
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
the role of the legislature so Mr
 
02:01:51.709 --> 02:01:51.719 align:start position:0%
chairman I believe you're you're talking
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
about what our Supreme Court wrestle
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
with and the plot and Davis decision I
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
looked that one up actually those are
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
those are very very difficult lines to
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
discern and a separation of powers
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
setting uh so the the best way I can
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
think to answer that question is is to
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
to reference my prior testimony about
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
what you all have told us are the degree
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
to which the Rules of Evidence apply in
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
a particular case type and what burden
 
02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:21.179 align:start position:0%
of proof applies to that case type as a
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
matter of statute
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
so that is clearly in the legislature's
 
02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.250 align:start position:0%
so that is clearly in the legislature's
lane

02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
lane
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
how we conduct a hearing in other words
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
how we interpret evidence let in
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
evidence we're really talking about the
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
lenses through which we view facts and
 
02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:39.980 align:start position:0%
establish facts
 
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
that is clearly a Judicial function so I
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
I think the line is somewhere between
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I confess it's gray and I'm not
 
02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
convinced it's clear and either decision
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
I referenced uh but I would I would
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
submit that when the legislature
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
promulgates the law the legislature is
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly within its right to tell us
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not particular rules should
 
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
apply and if not if so but in any case
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
what the standard of proof is
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
but once we get into the courtroom
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
how evidence is presented to the
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
tribunal is purely a Judicial function
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
and so the interpretation of the Rules
 
02:03:19.370 --> 02:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
of Evidence would always be within the
 
02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
Judiciary this is the best answer I can
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
give the Supreme Court of which being
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
the final Arbiter page Supreme Court
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
being the final corporate so it sounds
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
like a good collaborative effort here
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
where we're talking with each other and
 
02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
not at each other absolutely would be
 
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
the best way to go forward which is why
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
I have several things in here thinking
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
that a nice sit down would be preferable
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
to our filing an LSR uncertainty
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely and as judge Lemire made
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
clear uh we are always interested we're
 
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh in for opportunities where we can
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
share those sorts of insights we want to
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
get it right when you tell us that the
 
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
technical rules are relaxed and we have
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
to go figure out what that means if we
 
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a dialogue about what that means
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
even better uh Clarity is better than
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
not having Clarity and could I ask
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
anyone who knows this to what degree
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
would that dialogue be permissible and
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
not violating 91a I would defer to judge
 
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
king and judge Ashley
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
on that question all right well then
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
even better I've got a lawyer right
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and would you drop off
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
or give us the five of us who are going
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be looking at Rules of Evidence next
 
02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning or if you have to leave
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
to the research assistant your contact
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
information uh because I'll give you 24
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
hours and then I'll call you I'm thank
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
you so more than happy to do so thank
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity and one question
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry Mr chairman
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
oh yes I I did promise to uh carry a
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
point forward and I believe I began with
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
a discussion about being a family law
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
practitioner uh in a state where the
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence apply uh if we're
 
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
talking about procedural fairness and
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont The Rules of Evidence apply to
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
family proceedings if you want to watch
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
a pro se litigant go from terrified in
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to terrified and totally
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
lost apply the rules of evidence in a
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
formal way it makes it next to
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
Impossible uh for a pro se litigant to
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
get a point across when the formal rules
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
apply so I would just leave you with
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
that comment that these strict technical
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
application of this book would make it
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
10 times harder for a pro se litigant to
 
02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
try a case and we're dealing with 90 of
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
the people so it's your testimony that
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire are not just
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
upside down in terms of what they look
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
like on a map and divided by a river
 
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you representative
 
02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you representative
ball

02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
ball
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson I'm sorry I
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
just said one yes please yes I apologize
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you for being here
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
um one of the questions that kept coming
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
up before us and and we were actually a
 
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
little bit surprised those of us who
 
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
visited one of the courthouses
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
um is the idea of presumption of 50 50
 
02:06:02.639 --> 02:06:04.310 align:start position:0%
um is the idea of presumption of 50 50
parenting

02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and we were surprised to hear that
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case with the
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
judges we everyone seemed to assume that
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
that was a presumption that that's what
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child was but
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
was surprised to hear that that is not
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
the case
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm wondering is if it's not
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
the case how is anything less than that
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
um warranted and if you're the if you're
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
the parent not getting if you're getting
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
less than 50 percent of the time how do
 
02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
you present evidence to say that that
 
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
ruling may not be in the best interest
 
02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
um that was one part of my question I'm
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering what your Viewpoint is on
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
that so the answer is actually in in
 
02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
your question itself so I we deal with
 
02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
two subsections of 461a when we're
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
looking at that 461 A2 which is the
 
02:06:56.810 --> 02:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislature statement of purpose we
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
presume children do best when both
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
parents have a meaningful involvement in
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
their children's lives meaningful of
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
course is not defined so we look to 461
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
A6 which are the best interest factors
 
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
and there are many and it is in those
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
factors that we weigh evidence about
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
the time children spend with each parent
 
02:07:19.010 --> 02:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
as a best interest consideration we're
 
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
talking about a vast territory of
 
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
evidence and I can't give you any
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
specifics because I would have to see a
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
factual presentation to tell you how I
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
would weigh such a determination
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
filtered through 461a in terms of the
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
best interest factors but that the
 
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
there's no presumption that
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
that exists currently it tells us to
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
take the 461a2 framing to go into 461a
 
02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
and weigh those factors against the
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
framing it may not look exactly 50 50
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a variance sometimes
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
there's a very compelling safety reason
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
where it may not be unfortunately in the
 
02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
state and we're I'm not talking out of
 
02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
turn here we have a very serious opiate
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
addiction problem and some parents May
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
simply not be suitable at a particular
 
02:08:06.770 --> 02:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
time for Shared Parenting so that's a
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
best interest Factor we'd have to weigh
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
so it is very very much a fact specific
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
and case-by-case determination
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
I was I guess I'm taking that clean case
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
where the barring all of those extra
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
things that there seems to be
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
um sometimes
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
the people that came before us to
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
testify were not able to understand it
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
there was also one person who testified
 
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
um and he said that he was found not
 
02:08:34.129 --> 02:08:34.139 align:start position:0%
guilty in a criminal court but yet came
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
to the civil court and lost full custody
 
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
of his child is that
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um something that happens or I mean
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
that's where we a lot of what was coming
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
before us just to clarify is people were
 
02:08:47.689 --> 02:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
concerned that there was a weaponization
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
of the civil court and that's what we're
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
con I'm particularly concerned about
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
the weaponization of court is something
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
that we should all be concerned about
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
abusing legal process is something we
 
02:09:01.729 --> 02:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
should all be concerned about there's no
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
doubt about that I can only answer your
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
question I think you're asking me a
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
specific question that someone it sounds
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
like had a criminal charge and there was
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
an acquittal that
 
02:09:17.089 --> 02:09:17.099 align:start position:0%
They Carried into family court and said
 
02:09:18.530 --> 02:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
hey I was acquitted of what they accused
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
me from accuse me about but you have to
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
remember again this is why I was careful
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
to lay out the burden's proof that's
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt when the
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
Family Vision we're typically at a
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
preponderance standard so we are that is
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
another gray area that we have to
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
wrestle with uh wrestle with often now
 
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
if a case has gone to a jury and a jury
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
has decided that some some thing did not
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
happen that's something we would
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
consider that would be uh some we were
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
talking about judicial notice at some
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
point a litigator if representing that
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
party would point out a jury of this
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
person's peers who's acquitted this
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
person of this particular fact
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
we could notice that docket as evidence
 
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
that 12 people took a look at it and
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
said no it didn't happen so we would
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
certainly pay close attention to that
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
but I would have to know a lot more
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
about that I was just curious because
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
that did come up often about the
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
weaponization part
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I appreciate your
 
02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
time pleasure to be here thank you thank
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
you before we move on to the next person
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
I have a printed out on my own printer
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
the complete rules of evidence that
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
looks like that when somebody gives you
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
one and uh in terms of Representative
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
long Greg or ball does anybody want this
 
02:10:30.169 --> 02:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
does anybody my age want this for next
 
02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:34.189 align:start position:0%
does anybody my age want this for next
week

02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
my copy is actually falling apart I've
 
02:10:42.729 --> 02:10:42.739 align:start position:0%
been reading it so much yes
 
02:10:45.169 --> 02:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
judge king who do we have we have
 
02:10:45.179 --> 02:10:46.189 align:start position:0%
judge king who do we have we have
training

02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
you me and we have judge Ashley on forms
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
I know you're running short of time so
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
maybe well that's my fault and we only
 
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
have we meet next at one o'clock for
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
things so I'm willing to stay past well
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
why don't judge as we talk about the
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
phones that shouldn't take too long and
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
then we'll see where we are okay
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
and do you have a 91a answer for me in
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
terms of a few of us from Judiciary the
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and a few of us decide to uh
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
work things out nicely before we come
 
02:11:18.649 --> 02:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
public and announce it I have attorney
 
02:11:22.450 --> 02:11:22.460 align:start position:0%
Cregan right over here come on
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman uh
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
you you may or may not know this but the
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislator has not assigned 91a to the
 
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so the major operative concern
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
when you're convening a meeting between
 
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the Judiciary is
 
02:11:45.129 --> 02:11:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.770 --> 02:11:47.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
91a covers the legislature and the
 
02:11:52.970 --> 02:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
executive branch but it does not cover
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary we're Bound by part one
 
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
article 8 of The Constitution in our
 
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
response to public records requests
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
um so we cannot by definition have a 91a
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
violation if we meet with you well it's
 
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
more accurate to say that the Judiciary
 
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
does not have a 91a violation the
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislature is still Bound by its own
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
rules on convening so if you have a rule
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
for example for Quorum of members you
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
would have to open that role would be
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
observed by your rules I think fewer
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of us could have a
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful meeting with you at some point
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and I
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
you very briefly on the issue of forms
 
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's the most exciting topic you can
 
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
ever think of so they they saved it to a
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
quarter of 12.
 
02:12:48.169 --> 02:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
um my name is Susan Ashley I'm the
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
deputy administrative judge for the
 
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
circuit court and I know that this is an
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
issue that was identified by your
 
02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:57.020 align:start position:0%
committee to address particularly
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
user-friendly forms I think
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to report that it's good
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
timing because the judicial branch is
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
actually on the verge of issuing an RFP
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
seeking a vendor to assist us with forms
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
simplification and it's that is tied to
 
02:13:16.729 --> 02:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
part of the Court's work with the new
 
02:13:18.649 --> 02:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly new
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
um entity that has been set up by the
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court within the administrative
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
office of the courts it's the office of
 
02:13:28.129 --> 02:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
access and Community engagement that
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
that office is working in conjunction
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
with the Court's access to Justice
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
Commission you may have all heard of the
 
02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
access to Justice Commission has been in
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
place for many years we those of us who
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
are part of the commission call it a2j
 
02:13:43.729 --> 02:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
because we always have to have an
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
acronym for things but the a2j
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
commission it's it's a it's about 30
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
something odd folks who are involved
 
02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
with it members of the courts members of
 
02:13:56.530 --> 02:13:56.540 align:start position:0%
legal service agencies
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are often community-minded
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
and are interested in this and it's
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
focused on civil matters so it's not a
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
criminal Focus it's focused on civil
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
legal issues and making sure that folks
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
who should be able to have access to the
 
02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
courts can have that access to the court
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
so as part of the a2j's work there there
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
was an application quite some time back
 
02:14:23.810 --> 02:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
for arpa funds and we actually received
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
some arpa funds earlier this year for
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
six different projects and one of those
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
projects is forms simplification and so
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
we are at the point at this stage of
 
02:14:37.729 --> 02:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
issuing an RFP that is looking for a
 
02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
vendor who will assist the court in the
 
02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
process of identifying certain forms
 
02:14:46.209 --> 02:14:46.219 align:start position:0%
that we can make plain language
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
more plain language than they are at
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
this point obviously It's tricky because
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
our forms do sometimes need to contain
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
legal terms and Concepts that can never
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
be plain language because they are what
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
they are you know they've been
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislated to be called whatever they
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
are but still the use of use of the
 
02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
forms can be improved for sure
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
so this effort is going to give it's a
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
certain finite amount of money of course
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
that has been given to us through the
 
02:15:19.370 --> 02:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and it's going to look at
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
which forms are the highest use forms
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
that we have and I should just say the
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
the court system circuit court itself
 
02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
has upwards of 1100 forms so we're
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to make all of our
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
forms user friendly and and why one bite
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
but it's going to look at which forms we
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
may be able to improve upon
 
02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a family lens to it I
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
can assure you that because that is
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
where we hear of the most difficulty
 
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:53.099 align:start position:0%
with some of our forms again because
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
these are cases that often do not have
 
02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:57.380 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved they're going to
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
identify which ones are most frequently
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
filled out incorrectly
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
and that's sometimes they're not filled
 
02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
out at all which is its own issue but
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're just complicated and
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
folks don't understand what they're
 
02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
supposed to be putting into these forms
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
so they're going to identify what these
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
are and and take a crack at improving
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
them so the vendor would be
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking at those convening folks
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
convening subject matter experts to
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
identify those forms and then working on
 
02:16:28.609 --> 02:16:28.619 align:start position:0%
improving those documents themselves
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
including instructions for completing
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
the documents and then they would also
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
be training Court staff because of
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
course we're always in the process of
 
02:16:40.370 --> 02:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
revising forms and potentially creating
 
02:16:42.290 --> 02:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
new forms if there's a statutory change
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
or a shift and so it would help us going
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
forward as well the work is going to be
 
02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
done we expect over the next
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
six to nine months the RFP again is just
 
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:54.260 align:start position:0%
going out
 
02:16:56.810 --> 02:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully sometime this month so that
 
02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
process will go through its typical
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
typical process and then the work would
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
begin in Earnest end of this calendar
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
year we hope and through the next six
 
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:06.730 align:start position:0%
year we hope and through the next six
months

02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:06.740 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
simultaneously the court is also and
 
02:17:10.610 --> 02:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing this for quite
 
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
some time you're all aware that some of
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
our case types are electronically filed
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
are divorce parenting cases are not
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
electronically filed but we want to try
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
to make an impact on those in a way that
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
might be helpful by utilizing what we
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
call a guided interview
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
which is used for instance if you're
 
02:17:34.370 --> 02:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
filing a guardianship case you're you're
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
taken through a a guided interview where
 
02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
it tells you what information it needs
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then it will populate the petition
 
02:17:45.410 --> 02:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
and it creates the petition for you
 
02:17:47.690 --> 02:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
this would be a guided interview for our
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit now you've heard the
 
02:17:52.250 --> 02:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
judges talk about the financial
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
affidavit it is
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
a difficult form to fill out
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
um it certain requires certain
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
information sometimes folks don't
 
02:18:03.169 --> 02:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
exactly understand what that means for
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
what's being asked so this guided
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
interview would be a way to have them
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
input the information it would explain
 
02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
more what we're looking for and then it
 
02:18:15.049 --> 02:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
would do certain calculations so they
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
can put in whatever their income is off
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
of their paycheck and then it's going to
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
tell them what their monthly income is
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
for instance so they don't have to do
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
the math themselves it we have heard
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
over and over from self-represented
 
02:18:28.610 --> 02:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
litigants and from lawyers who do these
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
cases that this would be an
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
extraordinary help to all litigants and
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
family cases if we had this type of a
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
guided interview so there's some
 
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
conversations that we're having to see
 
02:18:42.290 --> 02:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
how we can advance that technologically
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
speaking and we're hoping to work on
 
02:18:47.089 --> 02:18:47.099 align:start position:0%
that as well again over the next many
 
02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
months to see if we can create something
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
like that that would be helpful for that
 
02:18:53.469 --> 02:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
one particular form in our that is
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
required for all of our parenting and
 
02:18:58.009 --> 02:18:58.019 align:start position:0%
divorce cases and as judge Lemire said
 
02:19:01.009 --> 02:19:01.019 align:start position:0%
required to be completed frequently in
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
those matters the special committee's
 
02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on forms
 
02:19:06.899 --> 02:19:07.490 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on forms
um

02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative Greg represent
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon ball and myself
 
02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
are also members of this meet next
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at 1pm my guess is we're just
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
going to try to identify forms we keep
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
hearing about I I don't suspect we'll
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
move towards suggesting litigation or
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
anything but just being four Friends of
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
the Court
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's that's the timeline on
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
this we'll try to get our work done from
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
all the things people came in and told
 
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
us about and uh absolutely pass them
 
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
along which will probably mostly just
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
underscore what you already know
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
fair enough well happy to have the input
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to provide to us and if we
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
can provide any further information
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
happy to provide it and I know you
 
02:19:56.929 --> 02:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
probably would like to hear from Judge
 
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
King so I would like to hear if there
 
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
are any questions otherwise I can step
 
02:20:00.540 --> 02:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
are any questions otherwise I can step
back

02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh oh I can get a quick you get a quick
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
question this is a brief question
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
is there a is is there some sort of
 
02:20:15.969 --> 02:20:15.979 align:start position:0%
public participation
 
02:20:18.969 --> 02:20:18.979 align:start position:0%
now I understand that you will have
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're flagged you have data as to what
 
02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
forms are complicated uh but in these
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
processes is there some sort of public
 
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
participation there is there is
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to be public
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
participation in these but what I was
 
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
just speaking about absolutely we want
 
02:20:35.929 --> 02:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
the input from the public some of it
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
comes through the a2j commission members
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
who work closely with various members so
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
it filters up through them but also one
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
input from folks who are using these
 
02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
forms testing and saying is this helpful
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
and is this the right language to use
 
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
and also part of this I didn't get into
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
it but it's also going to be an ADA
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
accessibility issue as well so we want
 
02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their the forms are
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
accessible to everybody who needs them
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
right thank you how would my friends in
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
the back row who would like to be part
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
of this or in their networks of people
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
some of whom would like to be part of
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
this uh discover how they can have their
 
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
voices heard
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
we can provide information to you if
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to you as to how they can
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
get input
 
02:21:23.210 --> 02:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
on these forms issues I can do that
 
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
afterwards good okay
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you because I know they will
 
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
want to do this great
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
um judge king are you going to be
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
meeting with us at one about training I
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
am then we can have anybody else who
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
wants to testify
 
02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
um before that go now in case we run out
 
02:21:59.690 --> 02:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
and then we re-adjourn it one so anyone
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we're I think the group
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that came with me we're pretty much done
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
except for the fourth topic of training
 
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
which we'll do at one o'clock okay so
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's no need for you to do it twice
 
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
okay unless you think you'd like a dry
 
02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:18.849 align:start position:0%
okay unless you think you'd like a dry
run

02:22:18.849 --> 02:22:18.859 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
we need training believe me no I'm happy
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do how whatever the committee wants
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do I was prepared to just sort of
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
give a thumbnail sketch of training but
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do that at one o'clock and
 
02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
give everybody extra 10 minutes that'll
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of lunch time but
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
before everybody goes just remember
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
those who we've asked if you can provide
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
us the contact information you're
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
allowed us to have would appreciate that
 
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.670 align:start position:0%
allowed us to have would appreciate that
also

02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
um we uh identified four different areas
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
from all the documents that came to us
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
all the research that was done all the
 
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
people testifying we identified four
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
different areas and we've covered them
 
02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
today we'll be having our subcommittee
 
02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
meetings of the special committee and
 
02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:07.010 align:start position:0%
meetings of the special committee and
um

02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
see what happens my guess is that in
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
some if not all it will be we will have
 
02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:15.230 align:start position:0%
some if not all it will be we will have
recommendations

02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
or we would like to schedule a minority
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
of us to meet with you in in ways that
 
02:23:24.910 --> 02:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
are appropriate to 91a of the house
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
there may be a case or so where we would
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
come up with an LSR and see if it'll
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
turn into a bill into a law we have been
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
granted the right even though the
 
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
deadline was three weeks ago for house
 
02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
file bills we as a special committee
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
have been given a deadline to early
 
02:23:48.969 --> 02:23:48.979 align:start position:0%
November so if we're going to do that
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
we have that time framework I've been
 
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
told that there may be a few cases where
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary would actually want us to
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
make a law or enact a law proposal thank
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
you proposal law because that would be
 
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
helpful to you and if that's the case we
 
02:24:10.849 --> 02:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
would like to cooperate with that my
 
02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
guess is once we're done with these four
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
areas we're going to be taking a look at
 
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
a few other areas and I understand that
 
02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
there's been some conversation amongst
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
some of the special committee members to
 
02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
see do we need to have some more
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and look at other issues
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
or is our work done and then we file our
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
final report I think that's still to be
 
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
determined going forward if it is
 
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
determined that there's one or two other
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
items we've got November and December
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
minus holiday periods to have a hearing
 
02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
and a subcommittee discussion on that so
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
that's where I think we're going anyone
 
02:24:51.770 --> 02:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
else from up here then I get to use this
 
02:24:55.010 --> 02:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
because incrementally I'm being moved to
 
02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
the law thing from the we're done
 
02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:01.429 align:start position:0%
the law thing from the we're done
there

02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon the time being
 
03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
um one o'clock on October 3rd
 
03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to call to order the
 
03:35:56.100 --> 03:35:57.590 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to call to order the
subcommittee

03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:36:00.610 --> 03:36:00.620 align:start position:0%
on the special committee on Family Court
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
which is looking at judicial training
 
03:36:05.100 --> 03:36:07.010 align:start position:0%
which is looking at judicial training
education

03:36:07.010 --> 03:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:36:07.020 --> 03:36:08.690 align:start position:0%
education
supervision

03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
and accountability these are issues that
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
came up in the series of hearings that
 
03:36:18.769 --> 03:36:18.779 align:start position:0%
we've had up until now and
 
03:36:21.610 --> 03:36:21.620 align:start position:0%
um we are quite honored
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
judge king who is going to
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit more about
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
this area judge king thank you so much
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
for spending so much time with us today
 
03:36:40.490 --> 03:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
we know you don't have enough time to do
 
03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
your job and here we are
 
03:36:45.530 --> 03:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
taking you away from your job thank you
 
03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
guys it's an honor to be here I'm David
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
King I'm the administrative judge of the
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
circuit court and truly this
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
is a topic that's very important to me
 
03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's probably one of the more
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
challenging aspects of my job as an
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
administrative judge with 60
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
or so judicial officers with I would say
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
pretty constant turnover
 
03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:06.290 align:start position:0%
pretty constant turnover
um

03:37:06.290 --> 03:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:08.210 --> 03:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
so I've kind of broken it into three
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
components in terms of training so
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
component one would be the brand new
 
03:37:16.010 --> 03:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
judges that come to us and then our
 
03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
ongoing regular judicial training for
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
our existing judges and then what I call
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term specialty
 
03:37:26.809 --> 03:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
training and the example I'll use is the
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
probate division where I'm literally the
 
03:37:30.889 --> 03:37:30.899 align:start position:0%
only judge left in New Hampshire that
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
was appointed to the probate court and
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
we've had some judges with probate
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
experience who have been doing the
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
probate work but three of them are
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
retiring one just retired judge Weaver
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
two more shortly thereafter and we don't
 
03:37:44.929 --> 03:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
have the bench
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so I am recruiting existing
 
03:37:50.090 --> 03:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
experienced judges into the probate
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
Division and we're putting together a
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
plan that's my next major project so
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
that those are kind of the three buckets
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:37:59.690 --> 03:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's in I know you understand this but
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's important to just consider that we
 
03:38:04.190 --> 03:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
don't choose
 
03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
don't choose
judges

03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
judges
 
03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:06.950 align:start position:0%
judges
um

03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's no process
 
03:38:12.170 --> 03:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
for us to vet Canada executive
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
Branch that's the way it should be
 
03:38:16.729 --> 03:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
that's the Constitution but I trying to
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
think of an analogy a fewer a general
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
contractor and you build houses and you
 
03:38:22.670 --> 03:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
didn't hire independent Subs you did
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
everything and you needed
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
a Mason and somebody else was doing the
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
hiring for you and they gave you a bunch
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
of roofers
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
you still have to take the roofers but
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
you have to figure out how to teach the
 
03:38:36.349 --> 03:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
masonry and you know in a fairly short
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
time get them into the rotation so that
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
you can build a complete house we have
 
03:38:41.450 --> 03:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
to build a complete house in in the
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
circuit court so as a result we get
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
judges with a variety of backgrounds
 
03:38:48.530 --> 03:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
that Governors have done an excellent
 
03:38:50.210 --> 03:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
job over the years of giving us good
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
candidates but if we're in a point in
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
time when we need a lot of family
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
division judges and we get three or four
 
03:38:58.130 --> 03:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in a row who are great
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers and know the criminal stuff
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
inside out we still have to teach them
 
03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
the Family Division because that's our
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
need at the time
 
03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:07.309 align:start position:0%
need at the time
um

03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
probate's another area that's really
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
specialized it's a it's the only area in
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch it's actually
 
03:39:14.809 --> 03:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
growing our criminal numbers are down
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
our civil numbers are down but New
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a growing a graying State
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
and so our Estates and our guardianships
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
numbers are going up we need more
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
probate probate expertise
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
since we created the Circuit Court in
 
03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
since we created the Circuit Court in
2012

03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
2012
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
hard to believe but we've onboarded more
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
than 50 new judges
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the only judge left
 
03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
full-time judge left it was on the bench
 
03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
when we created the Circuit Court
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
my colleagues have all left me there
 
03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
were 45 full-time judges in marital
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
Masters and I'm literally the only one
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
left which I guess tells you that we've
 
03:39:50.690 --> 03:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about training over the
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
last 12 years
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
um we currently as I mentioned this
 
03:39:59.090 --> 03:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
morning have 13 judicial officers I
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
can't call them judges because under the
 
03:40:02.210 --> 03:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
Constitution they're not judges anymore
 
03:40:03.889 --> 03:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
but 13 judicial officers who are
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
currently hearing cases who are over the
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
age of 70. one of them I won't tell you
 
03:40:10.610 --> 03:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
his age but he's been constitutionally
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
retired for 10 years
 
03:40:15.650 --> 03:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
and he regularly takes cases in landlord
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
tenant and small claims he knows how to
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
run a docket he's pretty efficient he
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
does a great job and we use him because
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
he's good and because we we need all the
 
03:40:27.170 --> 03:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
days that he can give us and just to put
 
03:40:30.170 --> 03:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
it in perspective Governor sununu has
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
appointed 35 judges to the Circuit Court
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
since he's been Governor so a lot of
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
turnover we also have a judge recently
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
appointed whose retirement date is 2057
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
2057. when I swore him in I said I'll be
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
dead when you retire which isn't really
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
funny but it's the truth I mean he's and
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you change the concept if the
 
03:40:55.190 --> 03:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution changes
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
um to 75 he'll his retirement date will
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
be 2062.
 
03:41:01.610 --> 03:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
for sure I'll be dead then
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
um even if I'm really lucky and make it
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
to my late 90s I think Bob Lynn if this
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I'm sorry and I didn't ask your
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
the training of new judges is governed
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
by a Supreme Court rule 55 we do it
 
03:41:28.250 --> 03:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
in-house by and large we rely on our
 
03:41:29.690 --> 03:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
administrators with our five
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
administrators in the Circuit Court
 
03:41:34.849 --> 03:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
they're all attorneys we have
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
authorization for three staff attorneys
 
03:41:39.530 --> 03:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
we have a newly vacant position as of
 
03:41:41.090 --> 03:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
today so we actually have two staff
 
03:41:43.729 --> 03:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the seats we don't have
 
03:41:46.010 --> 03:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
legally trained clerks our clerks with
 
03:41:48.650 --> 03:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
two exceptions are not lawyers
 
03:41:50.570 --> 03:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
so it's the
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
administrative judges the administrators
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
the staff attorneys and then judges like
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
judge Lemire who come in and do case
 
03:41:59.710 --> 03:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
specific training for new judges
 
03:42:03.170 --> 03:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
because we don't have law Clerks
 
03:42:05.889 --> 03:42:05.899 align:start position:0%
we've had to find a different way to
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
provide that service which is also a big
 
03:42:13.610 --> 03:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
part of our training so for example we
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
have a list serve that's very active
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
that all of the judges and the staff
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys are on where a judge can say
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
hey I've got a landlord tenant case with
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
this nuance
 
03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:26.030 align:start position:0%
this nuance
uh

03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
anybody can anybody help me and you know
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
an experienced judge usually within a
 
03:42:31.729 --> 03:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
few minutes we'll see that and provide
 
03:42:33.889 --> 03:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
an answer or a new judge I'm going on
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
the bench in five minutes can somebody
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
call me now and there's always somebody
 
03:42:40.130 --> 03:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
that sees that and and provides a
 
03:42:42.650 --> 03:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
Lifeline to the new judges so that's
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's not really training but it is
 
03:42:46.969 --> 03:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
training in the sense that that's a
 
03:42:49.210 --> 03:42:49.220 align:start position:0%
resource that's available for new judges
 
03:42:51.889 --> 03:42:51.899 align:start position:0%
who are constantly learning we're all
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
constantly learning as far as that goes
 
03:42:54.600 --> 03:42:57.130 align:start position:0%
constantly learning as far as that goes
um

03:42:57.130 --> 03:42:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:00.050 --> 03:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
when covet hit in early March I was
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that we were canceling
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of hearings and
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
there would be a perception perhaps by
 
03:43:11.450 --> 03:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
someone from this branch of government
 
03:43:14.929 --> 03:43:14.939 align:start position:0%
that we had judges who weren't busy so
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
every judge in the Circuit Court was
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
given an assignment within a couple of
 
03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:19.550 align:start position:0%
given an assignment within a couple of
days

03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:43:23.210 --> 03:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
to prepare training materials so judge X
 
03:43:27.050 --> 03:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
you're doing alimony you're doing
 
03:43:29.330 --> 03:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
um you know prelimited heirs in the
 
03:43:30.530 --> 03:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Probate Court everybody got an
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
assignment their job was to do a memo on
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
the substantive law a bench card that
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
judges could have with a synopsis of
 
03:43:39.650 --> 03:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
what they needed and a PowerPoint that
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
we could use for training and I think
 
03:43:44.570 --> 03:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
there were 50 50 plus assignments and so
 
03:43:47.570 --> 03:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
kind of within the course of a month we
 
03:43:49.190 --> 03:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
completely revamped our training
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
materials that we used to train new
 
03:43:54.010 --> 03:43:54.020 align:start position:0%
judges and a lot of those include
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
recorded presentations that we've done
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
if we bring an expert in if we can find
 
03:44:00.530 --> 03:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
the money and we can get their
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
permission to record it let's say it's
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
on the brain development of children
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
we've had experts on that
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
costs money to bring that expert in but
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
we can record that and put that into the
 
03:44:15.170 --> 03:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
bank of materials that we have and so
 
03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
during the course of new judge training
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
a judge will be assigned to watch that
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
video and it's a you know it's a way on
 
03:44:23.330 --> 03:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
sort of the New Hampshire way of doing
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
things without continually bringing in
 
03:44:28.969 --> 03:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
speakers that cost money to capture that
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
because that's sort of a topic that
 
03:44:32.450 --> 03:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't change a lot with time the
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:37.319 --> 03:44:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:41.050 --> 03:44:41.060 align:start position:0%
we cover
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
everything you know substantively that
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
we need to cover for training of new
 
03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:47.769 align:start position:0%
we need to cover for training of new
judges

03:44:47.769 --> 03:44:47.779 align:start position:0%
judges
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
we also take into account the skill set
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the judge that's been appointed so if
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
we have a prosecutor we know we don't
 
03:44:56.889 --> 03:44:56.899 align:start position:0%
have to spend a lot of extra time
 
03:44:59.150 --> 03:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
training on
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
substantive criminal law but that judge
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
probably needs a lot more of Judge
 
03:45:05.929 --> 03:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
lemire's time to learn the family so we
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
we do not have a one-size-fits-all
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
training for judges and the training
 
03:45:12.170 --> 03:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
materials that we have are not static
 
03:45:15.889 --> 03:45:15.899 align:start position:0%
they're constantly changing it um to
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
keep up with the law when new folks pass
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
new laws and we need to do training on
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
new legislative initiatives then that's
 
03:45:25.190 --> 03:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the training materials
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
the training
 
03:45:31.130 --> 03:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
about onboarding new judges we have
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
three in the pipeline right now we have
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
judge Tanya sponey who was sworn in last
 
03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:38.990 align:start position:0%
judge Tanya sponey who was sworn in last
Friday

03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
03:45:41.050 --> 03:45:41.060 align:start position:0%
she has a pretty
 
03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
wide background she's done quite a bit
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
of probate she's done a lot of family a
 
03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
little bit of criminal and some abuse
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
neglect so she's
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
got a good background which is kind of
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
unusual today we have judge Dorothy
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
Walsh who I'm going to swear in Thursday
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
morning she's a prosecutor for
 
03:46:02.690 --> 03:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester she's done a lot of domestic
 
03:46:04.370 --> 03:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
violence prosecutors so she's kind of an
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
expert on DV
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
and then Elizabeth Payne Betsy Payne is
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
a was a former that was the domestic
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
violence expert in in our operation for
 
03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
20 years I think the first round of
 
03:46:21.170 --> 03:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protocol she was the
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
primary author her dad was Bill Payne he
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
was the county attorney in Carroll
 
03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
County for years and then became the
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
Conway district court judge so she's
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
she's going to be able to wear her dad's
 
03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
robe if she's confirmed so she comes
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
with she now works for Casa as a staff
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
attorney she's been with him for a
 
03:46:38.090 --> 03:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
number of years so she knows the abuse
 
03:46:38.100 --> 03:46:40.010 align:start position:0%
number of years so she knows the abuse
neglect

03:46:40.010 --> 03:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
very well and she knows the domestic
 
03:46:43.729 --> 03:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
violence so when we put those three
 
03:46:46.130 --> 03:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
together in one class there's a lot of
 
03:46:48.290 --> 03:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
cross training that we can do just using
 
03:46:51.530 --> 03:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
the new judges to sort of educate each
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
other during the course of the training
 
03:46:53.340 --> 03:46:55.130 align:start position:0%
other during the course of the training
too

03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:46:55.140 --> 03:46:58.309 align:start position:0%
too
um

03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
question I hope we're not breaking your
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
train of thought
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
um when uh the document that you sent us
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
said that um
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh newly appointed Circuit Court judges
 
03:47:14.450 --> 03:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
received six weeks of training is that
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that's the ideal situation and
 
03:47:24.889 --> 03:47:24.899 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully when we the governor's
 
03:47:27.530 --> 03:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
been great working with us most of the
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
time these three judges are coming in
 
03:47:33.530 --> 03:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
like staggered over a period of time and
 
03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:34.750 align:start position:0%
like staggered over a period of time and
so

03:47:34.750 --> 03:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:38.530 --> 03:47:38.540 align:start position:0%
ideally it's six weeks start to finish
 
03:47:42.050 --> 03:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
and that's all training five days a week
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
for six weeks it's a combination of
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
out our uh administrative office so sort
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
of if you want to use the word classroom
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
training it's self-study it's mock
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
trials that we actually have scripts and
 
03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
we do we you know we teach them the
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
trial of work it's time in the domestic
 
03:48:04.969 --> 03:48:04.979 align:start position:0%
violence registry so they learn what
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
happens when they issue an order where
 
03:48:08.809 --> 03:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
it goes how it's processed we put them
 
03:48:10.370 --> 03:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
in the information center for a half a
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
day just so they can hear the phone
 
03:48:12.889 --> 03:48:12.899 align:start position:0%
calls coming in because I think that's
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
instructive about
 
03:48:16.849 --> 03:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
issues that litigants are struggling
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
with so that they can sort of have that
 
03:48:21.250 --> 03:48:21.260 align:start position:0%
in their mind when they're on the bench
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of shadowing with experienced
 
03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:25.130 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of shadowing with experienced
judges

03:48:25.130 --> 03:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
judges
 
03:48:29.150 --> 03:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
and we've debriefed every class if you
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
will over the last several years and
 
03:48:32.330 --> 03:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
we've learned that
 
03:48:34.610 --> 03:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
what we've been told is that the best
 
03:48:37.010 --> 03:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
way to teach the substantive law is to
 
03:48:39.889 --> 03:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
have the new judge go to let's say a
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant session where they're
 
03:48:42.650 --> 03:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
going to see a whole half day of
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant hearings
 
03:48:46.849 --> 03:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
and then the next day we give them the
 
03:48:48.650 --> 03:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts substantive law on
 
03:48:50.210 --> 03:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant we used to do it the
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
other way around and for whatever reason
 
03:48:54.050 --> 03:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
it works best when they watch the
 
03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
hearings and then they get the
 
03:48:57.889 --> 03:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
substantive loss so we that's all built
 
03:49:01.190 --> 03:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
into the into the schedule and who
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
who organizes that
 
03:49:04.969 --> 03:49:04.979 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
03:49:09.229 --> 03:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
um a training coordinator we do not it's
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
a combination of
 
03:49:11.580 --> 03:49:13.130 align:start position:0%
a combination of
me

03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley and Heather kulp who's our
 
03:49:17.929 --> 03:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
senior administrator
 
03:49:17.939 --> 03:49:19.250 align:start position:0%
senior administrator
um

03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
the staff attorneys are involved but it
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
changes because
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
people come and go and
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's who has the time
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment when a judge gets
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
appointed again we don't we have no
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
control over timing of Judges we'll take
 
03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
them anytime we can get them but
 
03:49:39.050 --> 03:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any control over that
 
03:49:39.060 --> 03:49:40.910 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any control over that
so

03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:43.490 --> 03:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something I'd love to
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for taking my question
 
03:49:53.450 --> 03:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
coming so I wanted to ask
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess a multi-part question so you
 
03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
had stated that the six weeks full-time
 
03:50:03.769 --> 03:50:03.779 align:start position:0%
would be an ideal situation but I know
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
that we're time constrained here so
 
03:50:07.610 --> 03:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily currently in an
 
03:50:10.190 --> 03:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
ideal situation so I guess my question
 
03:50:12.769 --> 03:50:12.779 align:start position:0%
would be how often are we actually doing
 
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
the six weeks of training verse how
 
03:50:16.130 --> 03:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
often are we having to start the judges
 
03:50:19.250 --> 03:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
sooner because we just we need them to
 
03:50:21.650 --> 03:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
hear cases and we don't the time isn't
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
oh sorry didn't know that
 
03:50:30.540 --> 03:50:33.170 align:start position:0%
oh sorry didn't know that
um

03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
I would say I'm going to say 50 50 just
 
03:50:39.170 --> 03:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
to pull in that's not scientific but I
 
03:50:41.530 --> 03:50:41.540 align:start position:0%
would say half the time we have a
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
big enough Group which I would say is
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
kind of three to make it work the best
 
03:50:48.410 --> 03:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
to just run it start to finish
 
03:50:50.570 --> 03:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
we will get the six weeks in one way or
 
03:50:50.580 --> 03:50:52.010 align:start position:0%
we will get the six weeks in one way or
another

03:50:52.010 --> 03:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
but it won't be six continuous weeks
 
03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
with all three judges at the same time
 
03:50:59.150 --> 03:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense that nobody gets
 
03:51:02.929 --> 03:51:02.939 align:start position:0%
shortchanged on what they get we
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
we might skip something for example we
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
haven't done uh training on probate
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
substantive law for a while because it's
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
a very specialized area of the law and
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
the judges that do it do a lot of it and
 
03:51:18.050 --> 03:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
now we're forced to do it because we
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the probate division judges
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
available and the plan for that
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
um just to share my thoughts
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh since like I said I'm it and we also
 
03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
we've also had some very long standing
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh one person who was with us for almost
 
03:51:37.849 --> 03:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
40 years who's been in the probate
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
division forever retiring so a lot of
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
our experienced probate staff are
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
leaving so it's a dual challenge it's
 
03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
recruiting staff to the probate Division
 
03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
and judges and so I've
 
03:51:53.150 --> 03:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
have a recent uh
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
30-year Deputy clerk who was a deputy
 
03:51:59.809 --> 03:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
probate register back in the day and has
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
a extensive knowledge of probate law she
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
is going to be my partner in this
 
03:52:05.570 --> 03:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and training effort of
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
judges and staff and we're going to do
 
03:52:10.190 --> 03:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
it together meaning we'll be training
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
staff and judges at the same time on
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
probate issues and the plan is because
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be involving judges who
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
are on the bench and have dockets it'll
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
be 12 to 1 we'll do it virtually and
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
we'll just pick a topic common law
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
spouse print admitted heirs just
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have materials training materials
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
it will do the an oral substantive
 
03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
training and hopefully we're going to
 
03:52:34.849 --> 03:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
gather some steam and we're going to
 
03:52:36.769 --> 03:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
start that after the first of the year
 
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
try to develop the talent on both sides
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
of the of the operation
 
03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um one other question so you
 
03:52:47.150 --> 03:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
had mentioned Supreme Court rule 55
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
governs the new judge training
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
it actually governs all judge training
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
so it's not only the new judges but it's
 
03:52:58.130 --> 03:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
the ongoing training requirement for all
 
03:53:01.130 --> 03:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
judges okay because I was seeing I saw
 
03:53:05.090 --> 03:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
continuing ad was under rule 45 but I
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't seeing maybe that's the rule that
 
03:53:09.650 --> 03:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning I I just want to make
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm looking at the at the
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
correct thing I see rule 45 is
 
03:53:15.889 --> 03:53:15.899 align:start position:0%
continuing judicial education and what's
 
03:53:17.929 --> 03:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
55 something totally different that I
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
think Alex has about the public
 
03:53:20.399 --> 03:53:21.950 align:start position:0%
think Alex has about the public
um

03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have a 65 it only goes to 50 to
 
03:53:27.050 --> 03:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh 62.
 
03:53:30.530 --> 03:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
um 55 is
 
03:53:33.410 --> 03:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
public protection fund okay I'd like to
 
03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
move to amend my
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
rule to it sounds like it's 45 is doing
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay so it's they're covered under both
 
03:53:43.250 --> 03:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
the continuing and the new judge is they
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
both prescribe to this rule 45 correct
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you and that rule has been changed
 
03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the past few years it used to be that
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
there was a rule that all new Superior
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
Court judges had to attend an
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
out-of-state General jurisdiction
 
03:53:57.530 --> 03:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
training within
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
X number of months or years from
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
appointment and
 
03:54:02.929 --> 03:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
and the district courts and the probate
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
courts I mean when I was I was sworn in
 
03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:06.710 align:start position:0%
courts I mean when I was I was sworn in
and

03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
in February of 1990 and I had a I had I
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
went to court the next day in the my new
 
03:54:14.809 --> 03:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
court the Cross County Probate Court and
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
the register of probe gave me my docket
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
on a yellow pad and she there was a coat
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
rack with a robe on it and that was my
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
training she said this this is the robe
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
and here's your doc and have a nice day
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I think we've come a long way from
 
03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:29.090 align:start position:0%
and I think we've come a long way from
that

03:54:29.090 --> 03:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
through the evolution of the circuit
 
03:54:32.570 --> 03:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
court because I at least all I had to
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
know is the probate right I didn't have
 
03:54:36.170 --> 03:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
to know everything and now with the
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court when you're appointed to
 
03:54:40.729 --> 03:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court under 490f there's a
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
presumption that you're able to do
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
whatever we do and the obligation is on
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
me I think to make sure that judges have
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
the training before I send them into the
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
Family Division to do a marital docket I
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to make sure they have the skills
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
that they need and that the confidence
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
that they need to be able to handle
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
those cases and those are the ones
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
they're most terrified of
 
03:55:01.490 --> 03:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
the new prosecutors when I say welcome
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
to the Circuit Court and the Family
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
Division they
 
03:55:07.969 --> 03:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath because they know
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
that with that comes the cases we've
 
03:55:11.809 --> 03:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning The JCC
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
complaints that are virtually a
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee that come with the territory
 
03:55:18.530 --> 03:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
and you know the just the
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
the nature of those cases are they're
 
03:55:22.370 --> 03:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
difficult cases but everybody gets a
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
judge in
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.399 --> 03:55:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:45.410 --> 03:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that these new judges
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
will be picking up some cases most
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
likely before they have finished
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
certainly their six weeks of
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
initial training
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
does that training involve
 
03:55:59.279 --> 03:56:01.729 align:start position:0%
does that training involve
um

03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
having an experienced either judge or
 
03:56:10.250 --> 03:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
Clerk of what you have none
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
um or some Court employee in the
 
03:56:18.650 --> 03:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
courtroom with a brand new judge to both
 
03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
be there if perhaps for Council but more
 
03:56:25.090 --> 03:56:25.100 align:start position:0%
significantly to be there for
 
03:56:28.689 --> 03:56:28.699 align:start position:0%
evaluation and subsequent
 
03:56:32.769 --> 03:56:32.779 align:start position:0%
communication yes for sure and what we
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have 34 Court locations some are
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
pretty small but we have a lot of
 
03:56:41.210 --> 03:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
multi-judge Courts and we
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
always Endeavor to put the new judges
 
03:56:46.189 --> 03:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
for at least their first year into a
 
03:56:47.570 --> 03:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
courthouse where there are other
 
03:56:49.610 --> 03:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
experienced judges in the next Chambers
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
because that's they get constant
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
feedback during the training process the
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
mentor judges the experienced judges
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
will have a judge assigned to them and
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
typically the way they do it is it's
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
watch one do one so they'll do a hearing
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of the judges are comfortable with
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
just having the two judges up at the
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
bench and they'll explain to the parties
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on so let's say judge Leary
 
03:57:15.250 --> 03:57:15.260 align:start position:0%
and Nashua who's been doing this forever
 
03:57:17.929 --> 03:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
will do a hearing or some hearings and
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
then the new judge will sit we'll move
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
over to that chair and judge Leary will
 
03:57:23.689 --> 03:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
sit beside him or her
 
03:57:26.809 --> 03:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
and watch and give feedback and
 
03:57:28.370 --> 03:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes sit in the back of the
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
courtroom for a for a few days and watch
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
and observe and give feedback
 
03:57:33.660 --> 03:57:34.490 align:start position:0%
and observe and give feedback
um

03:57:34.490 --> 03:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:37.490 --> 03:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's all part of the onboarding new
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
judge process and we like I said we do
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
even before we send them to a courthouse
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
we do mock hearings
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
in DV cases in landlord tenant cases
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
just so they can sort of get the Cadence
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a hearing
 
03:57:52.969 --> 03:57:52.979 align:start position:0%
most of the judges that come to us have
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
trial experience which is one of the
 
03:57:56.570 --> 03:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
most important attributes I think
 
03:57:58.490 --> 03:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
regardless of what type of law you
 
03:57:59.809 --> 03:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
practice so you know the rules of
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
evidence you know how cases proceed you
 
03:58:04.370 --> 03:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
know how to move a case along you know
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
when somebody's maybe taking too long
 
03:58:08.450 --> 03:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
and you can with experience push them
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
along a bit
 
03:58:11.809 --> 03:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
the judges that have not been in a
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
courtroom are the ones that would be the
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
most difficult to train but I don't
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
can't recall having one of those for a
 
03:58:17.570 --> 03:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
long time
 
03:58:20.590 --> 03:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
on your court I can think of at least
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
one chord where
 
03:58:25.490 --> 03:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
a member of the judicial branch who I
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe had no
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
court experience before but we don't
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
have to discuss that in any detail right
 
03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:37.189 align:start position:0%
have to discuss that in any detail right
now

03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:39.650 --> 03:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
well I was appointed by Judd Greg
 
03:58:39.660 --> 03:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
well I was appointed by Judd Greg
and

03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:43.189 align:start position:0%
and
he

03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
he
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
appointed one of his legal counsel who
 
03:58:47.090 --> 03:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
called me after I've been appointed and
 
03:58:48.889 --> 03:58:48.899 align:start position:0%
said Judd wants to put me on the
 
03:58:49.969 --> 03:58:49.979 align:start position:0%
Superior Court I've never been in a
 
03:58:51.290 --> 03:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
courtroom I don't know what to do and I
 
03:58:53.689 --> 03:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
said I'd take the position and he turned
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
out to be a very good Superior Court
 
03:58:57.410 --> 03:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
Judge he had literally never been in a
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
quorum he was a real estate lawyer for
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
not a long period of time and he was a
 
03:59:02.510 --> 03:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
great Superior Court Judge he's long
 
03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
since retired but it is possible
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
but you really have to study those Rules
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
of Evidence and really get up to speed
 
03:59:11.150 --> 03:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
so they have the confidence of the
 
03:59:12.650 --> 03:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
people that appear in front of you too
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
because I think people were skeptical
 
03:59:15.359 --> 03:59:16.670 align:start position:0%
because I think people were skeptical
but

03:59:16.670 --> 03:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
we can train anybody if we are given the
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.849 --> 03:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
but I think your point might be that
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're not given currently either the
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
time or the resources to do
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to put words in your
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
mouth my understanding is that you have
 
03:59:41.210 --> 03:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
indicated you could do a better job if
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
you had more time and more resources is
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
that correct absolutely we can always do
 
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
a better job and I think the the
 
03:59:48.600 --> 03:59:51.590 align:start position:0%
a better job and I think the the
resource

03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the the resources that we have are
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
the limitation in the number of you know
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
days that we can put in this and if we
 
04:00:03.050 --> 04:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
had most most courts I think have a
 
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
training person that's their job that
 
04:00:08.450 --> 04:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
they do judicial and staff training and
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
I think the Chief Justice would like to
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
move in that direction I think that's
 
04:00:13.969 --> 04:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
reflected I didn't see the final version
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the memo but I think in the
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion section
 
04:00:21.290 --> 04:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I see yes we haven't gotten to that
 
04:00:24.530 --> 04:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
yet okay but absolutely we could use
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
more resources to train new judges and
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
to get back to I think a question that
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative gutab asked about what do
 
04:00:31.729 --> 04:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
we do with the judges that are sort of
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
half trained there are some core things
 
04:00:36.410 --> 04:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
that we do at the front end with every
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
new judge the first day obviously we get
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
them fixed up with HR they get their I.T
 
04:00:44.090 --> 04:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know resources their computer their
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
laptop those kinds of basic things
 
04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
they spend at least a half day with me
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
just pouring through the Judicial Code
 
04:00:54.410 --> 04:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
of Conduct I think that's
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
the very first thing we need to talk
 
04:00:58.490 --> 04:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
about when we go through it section by
 
04:01:01.370 --> 04:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
section and as you can imagine over the
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
last 30 plus years I have
 
04:01:05.570 --> 04:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories about pretty much
 
04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
every section of the code where things
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
have or could go wrong and I share those
 
04:01:11.710 --> 04:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
with the new judges
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about procedural fairness
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of training around just how
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
to treat people
 
04:01:21.010 --> 04:01:21.020 align:start position:0%
that come in front of you
 
04:01:24.170 --> 04:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research that's been
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
done peer-reviewed research that
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
the satisfaction of litigants depends
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
more on how they were treated than the
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
result in the case so somebody can lose
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
a case and say you know what the judge
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
treated me fairly I'm good with that
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
people can win the case and think the
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
Judge is a real jerk so we really want
 
04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
people to feel like they got a fair day
 
04:01:47.809 --> 04:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
in court and that they've been treated
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
right and so we spent a lot of time on
 
04:01:49.800 --> 04:01:50.570 align:start position:0%
right and so we spent a lot of time on
that

04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:52.729 --> 04:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
and then if we have some judges that
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
know and I'll just just give you a
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
specific example when we've had some
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
judges that are that haven't had all of
 
04:02:00.830 --> 04:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
the substantive training but they've got
 
04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
the basic trial skills and the
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
the basics of how to be a judge because
 
04:02:08.450 --> 04:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
it is a different skill set when you get
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the bench for sure
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
and what we're going to do that this
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
year the judge the new judges that are
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
coming on board
 
04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
we knew there would be delays so we
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't build them into a schedule we're
 
04:02:23.330 --> 04:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
behind on our small claims trials your
 
04:02:24.889 --> 04:02:24.899 align:start position:0%
constituents are probably telling you
 
04:02:26.450 --> 04:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
that because we're still catching up
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
from covid we're going to do small
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
claims blitzes around the state with
 
04:02:31.849 --> 04:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
these new judges
 
04:02:33.889 --> 04:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
just going to go in and you know for a
 
04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
week you're going to hear small claims
 
04:02:36.650 --> 04:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
cases one after another after another
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to Chisel that
 
04:02:40.250 --> 04:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
backlog down
 
04:02:42.769 --> 04:02:42.779 align:start position:0%
in the bigger courts where those dockets
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
can be full day multi-day dockets
 
04:02:48.889 --> 04:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
um so that's our plan that and we've
 
04:02:52.849 --> 04:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.370 --> 04:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I think I know but I'd rather be sure
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
what is the dividing line on small
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
and between small claims and civil cases
 
04:03:18.650 --> 04:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's about 20 000 cases a year so it's
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you do you want to go on with your
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
initial presentation I I mean I think
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
I've kind of wandered around a bit I was
 
04:03:31.370 --> 04:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
going to touch on
 
04:03:33.769 --> 04:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
the second bucket which is the ongoing
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
training for existing judges we have
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
five training days a year
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'll call it it's mandatory that
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
judges go
 
04:03:46.490 --> 04:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate enough to have some
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
retired judges
 
04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
um like judge Spath who's not
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionally retired retired so she
 
04:03:54.769 --> 04:03:54.779 align:start position:0%
will do
 
04:03:56.450 --> 04:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
all of the arraignments for the whole
 
04:03:58.849 --> 04:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
state so that judges can be freed up to
 
04:04:01.610 --> 04:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
go we have a judge who will be doing
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
warrants for the day and then every
 
04:04:07.010 --> 04:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
judge in the state gets emergencies
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
every day the judges have to bring their
 
04:04:11.330 --> 04:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
laptops to training and they have to be
 
04:04:14.450 --> 04:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
available for the DV the ex party
 
04:04:16.969 --> 04:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
parenting the child placement so there
 
04:04:18.769 --> 04:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
we take breaks during the day so they
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
can check their laptops and issue
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
emergency orders but
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's five solid days of training our
 
04:04:27.130 --> 04:04:27.140 align:start position:0%
next one is Friday
 
04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
and we are fortunate enough to have some
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
money from the bar Foundation which is a
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund we have judge Sutton I
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
think I may have mentioned that in the
 
04:04:38.160 --> 04:04:40.130 align:start position:0%
think I may have mentioned that in the
materials

04:04:40.130 --> 04:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
materials
 
04:04:40.140 --> 04:04:40.910 align:start position:0%
materials
um

04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:42.769 --> 04:04:42.779 align:start position:0%
from the sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
 
04:04:44.929 --> 04:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
coming to do a talk on
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution versus the New
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and how they
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
interact and I think it will be a really
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
good program
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then we're doing training at that
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
event on the new protocols and abuse
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
neglect cases
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a smattering of trainings you
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
know of all the case types that we cover
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
spread out over the year and judges can
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
tell us what what they need
 
04:05:09.239 --> 04:05:10.790 align:start position:0%
tell us what what they need
um

04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
we try to send all of our new judges
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
within the first year or two to a
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
National week-long Domestic Violence
 
04:05:20.809 --> 04:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
program that's put on by the ncj fcj the
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
National Council of juvenile and Family
 
04:05:25.370 --> 04:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
Court judges
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
and to also an ncj fcj program on abuse
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
neglect cases we got way behind
 
04:05:36.050 --> 04:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
during the covid years because we had 20
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
judges that had come on the bench that
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
didn't have that training
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
so what we did last summer is we brought
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
the NC jfcj judges to New Hampshire and
 
04:05:47.530 --> 04:05:47.540 align:start position:0%
we did a multi-day program here
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory for the 22 new judges and then
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
Friday was a regular judicial education
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
day for us and all judges went to the
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
third day of that it was a it was a
 
04:05:59.090 --> 04:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
great program
 
04:06:01.610 --> 04:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
so right now all of the judges have had
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
the National Training except the three
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.290 --> 04:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
other points you want to share with us
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:06:19.969 --> 04:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
well I just think in terms of the tools
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
just which I think does dovetail with
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
education in addition to the listserve
 
04:06:25.319 --> 04:06:26.929 align:start position:0%
education in addition to the listserve
the

04:06:26.929 --> 04:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
um the training materials we have an
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
orders bank that is loaded with orders
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
that judges have written on all case
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
type so you know for me I've submitted
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
orders in the probate World on undue
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
influence incapacity cases in the trust
 
04:06:43.859 --> 04:06:45.410 align:start position:0%
influence incapacity cases in the trust
World

04:06:45.410 --> 04:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
World
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you know suppression issues in
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
criminal cases anything that's got
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's a well-written order and we we
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
kind of vet them go into the orders bank
 
04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
and they're searchable by topic they're
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
searchable by you can do a word search
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that's really helpful the list serve
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
is archived by the staff attorneys
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
because the same questions tend to come
 
04:07:06.660 --> 04:07:07.490 align:start position:0%
because the same questions tend to come
up

04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
so rather than reinvent the wheel we and
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
we have a you know broken down by
 
04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant whatever the different
 
04:07:16.250 --> 04:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
case types are so people can go search
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
there all of the new Supreme Court
 
04:07:20.809 --> 04:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
decisions that come down are summarized
 
04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
and archived in
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
there and anytime that a staff attorney
 
04:07:28.010 --> 04:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
writes a memo on a substantive issue
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
that goes into a Memo's bank and those
 
04:07:31.610 --> 04:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
are searchable
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
um by case type so that's how we've made
 
04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
up for not having law Clerks
 
04:07:40.130 --> 04:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
um a
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
virtual law clerk if you will and the
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
staff attorneys one of the staff
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's responsibilities is to make
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
sure that those stay current so if
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
there's a memo that's outdated because
 
04:07:53.150 --> 04:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature's changed the law or the
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's changed the law then we
 
04:08:00.170 --> 04:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
remove the no longer relevant materials
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
judge no law Kirk clerk says this always
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
been the case
 
04:08:15.769 --> 04:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
well it's resource is the reason but the
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
historically pre-circuit Court we had
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
the district court at one time there
 
04:08:25.490 --> 04:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
were a hundred district court judges
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
around the state they were very mostly
 
04:08:30.050 --> 04:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
part-time judges and they just kind of
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
did their own thing and then the probate
 
04:08:32.880 --> 04:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
did their own thing and then the probate
judges

04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
judges
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
there were 10 of us most we were all
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
part-time when I was appointed in 1990
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
the probate court was the first court to
 
04:08:48.530 --> 04:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
get a staff attorney uh non-superior
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
which I thought was pretty clever at the
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
time I've had several and many have
 
04:08:57.050 --> 04:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
become many of my staff attorneys have
 
04:08:58.250 --> 04:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
become judges
 
04:08:58.260 --> 04:08:59.570 align:start position:0%
become judges
but

04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:09:01.610 --> 04:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
the superior court has always had law
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
clerks and the Supreme Courts always had
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
law clerks the Supreme Court has 11 law
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
clerks Superior Court has I think 15 or
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
16 law clerks so it's about one law
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
clerk for every judge and a half
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
in the Superior Court Supreme Court
 
04:09:18.590 --> 04:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
judges all have two and the chief
 
04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
justice has three
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's certainly I hear about it all the
 
04:09:25.370 --> 04:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
time from the Circuit Court judges that
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would be a huge help
 
04:09:30.410 --> 04:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
um but again we we do what we can with
 
04:09:33.650 --> 04:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
what we have thank you thank you um kind
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
of like those old TV shows I used to
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
watch in the 50s where the the judge
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
rolled into town and he was a Savvy old
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
coot and he knew the law and he knew his
 
04:09:45.290 --> 04:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
people and he didn't need a locker he
 
04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
was one to himself I'm kind of hearing
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in a more Northeastern way
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
was a bunch of uh small town part-time
 
04:09:57.050 --> 04:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
judges doing things and it worked for
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure the state grew it was a it was a
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
lot simpler back then too I think the
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
issues were simpler and the marital
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
cases move much more quickly we didn't
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
have a trust code so we we didn't have
 
04:10:11.450 --> 04:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
trust litigation which is what I do when
 
04:10:12.889 --> 04:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing the administrative judge
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
work I do the complex trust docket and
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know for years judges lawyers have
 
04:10:17.520 --> 04:10:18.650 align:start position:0%
you know for years judges lawyers have
said

04:10:18.650 --> 04:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
04:10:23.090 --> 04:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
you need to trust you know avoid probate
 
04:10:24.410 --> 04:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
get a trust and that's where all the
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
litigation is that the litigation is in
 
04:10:28.090 --> 04:10:28.100 align:start position:0%
the trust world and
 
04:10:31.490 --> 04:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
those cases are I started a case last
 
04:10:33.050 --> 04:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
week it was supposed to be two days and
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
on the first day of trial they said we
 
04:10:36.170 --> 04:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
need three more we haven't even started
 
04:10:38.050 --> 04:10:38.060 align:start position:0%
the case yet
 
04:10:41.689 --> 04:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
those are multi-day trials some involved
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there's a lot of money
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in New Hampshire had
 
04:10:49.370 --> 04:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
cases with multi-millions of dollars the
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
tamposia's case is the most famous one
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
but that was a 29 day bench trial in the
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
04:10:58.849 --> 04:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
and the legal fees were over six million
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollars so we we do some big cases
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
which is why we need to train up some
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
more probate judges
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
um because somebody's going to take my
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
place when you I go on to greener
 
04:11:09.120 --> 04:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
place when you I go on to greener
pastures

04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
pastures
 
04:11:13.010 --> 04:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
a follow-up on my follow-up I hear ads
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
on WBZ Radio all the time don't lose
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
your assets to a nursing home you need
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to have a trust and I know a number of
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
people who say well gosh does that mean
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
a simple will isn't good enough anymore
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
so are you saying trusts are more
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
complicated than I might have led to
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
believe there are certainly good reasons
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
to have trusts okay
 
04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
um but it shouldn't be a will substitute
 
04:11:41.570 --> 04:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
in every case when people have modest
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
assets and
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
no you know they typically you get to
 
04:11:50.150 --> 04:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
trust and then you don't fund the trust
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
or you put some of your assets in the
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
trust but you always forget something so
 
04:11:55.490 --> 04:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
now you have an estate open and you have
 
04:11:57.889 --> 04:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
a trust open at the same time so it
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't make my life simpler
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
as a probate division judge just because
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have a trust unless you completely
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
do avoid probate
 
04:12:10.130 --> 04:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you and all this time I thought
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
this was a device by the
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
members of of the bar not the bench to
 
04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
be able to generate business am I wrong
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
about that you don't have to answer that
 
04:12:24.110 --> 04:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
well I think let me just simply say this
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think you can charge more to create a
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
trust than you can a simple will perhaps
 
04:12:34.250 --> 04:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and the kiss principle I
 
04:12:36.170 --> 04:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
think always works
 
04:12:36.180 --> 04:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
think always works
um

04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
you have uh if I'm if I'm
 
04:12:44.809 --> 04:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
if you are where I think you are and we
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
go to the suggestions section
 
04:12:50.330 --> 04:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
you talk about a New Hampshire judicial
 
04:12:50.340 --> 04:12:52.969 align:start position:0%
you talk about a New Hampshire judicial
College

04:12:52.969 --> 04:12:52.979 align:start position:0%
College
 
04:12:52.979 --> 04:12:54.469 align:start position:0%
College
um

04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not necessary
 
04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily sure are you you know you
 
04:13:01.370 --> 04:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
need something
 
04:13:05.090 --> 04:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
that sounds as highfalutin as uh New
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judicial College as much as
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
you might need
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
a director of training
 
04:13:12.720 --> 04:13:13.790 align:start position:0%
a director of training
um

04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:13.800 --> 04:13:15.469 align:start position:0%
um
or

04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:13:18.170 --> 04:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
a department of training
 
04:13:18.180 --> 04:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
a department of training
um

04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:23.450 --> 04:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
I see that your hope is that it would be
 
04:13:26.830 --> 04:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
in the 2627 budget which would be
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
surprisingly as it sounds the next
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
budget right we're almost ready to start
 
04:13:32.699 --> 04:13:34.010 align:start position:0%
budget right we're almost ready to start
asking

04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
asking
 
04:13:37.370 --> 04:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
do you have and I know you don't want to
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
commit to a particular number but do you
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
have any sense of
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
what size
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.769 --> 04:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
that would be to make sense to do it at
 
04:13:51.779 --> 04:13:52.729 align:start position:0%
that would be to make sense to do it at
all

04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know what the Chief Justice
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I haven't really sat down with
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
putting pencil to paper but I think the
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
concept is fairly simple that we would
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
and I think that whatever we call it is
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
secondary I think maybe call I don't
 
04:14:09.650 --> 04:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
know if college is too fancy a word but
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
I think the concept is we have a
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
dedicated training person
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for maintaining the
 
04:14:18.170 --> 04:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
training materials for the two trial
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
courts for putting together what what
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
are now our five programs a year because
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
we obviously do all of that ourselves
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty time consuming
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
for bringing in
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
experts from the outside because it's
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
more I think it's more cost effective
 
04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
especially with airfare and travel and
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
everything that goes with it it's it's
 
04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
expensive to send even three judges to
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
Reno for a week
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we bring the resources here
 
04:14:46.729 --> 04:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
and do in-house trainings but that takes
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of time too so I think the concept
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
would be this person would manage
 
04:14:53.570 --> 04:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
everything having to do with training
 
04:14:55.849 --> 04:14:55.859 align:start position:0%
for judges and probably some of the
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
staff training
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
using in-house resources but also using
 
04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
exterior resources whether it's sending
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
judges to programs or bringing programs
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
here I don't see it as a big
 
04:15:08.880 --> 04:15:09.769 align:start position:0%
here I don't see it as a big
um

04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:12.410 --> 04:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
a big staff
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
effort at least that's would be my
 
04:15:16.130 --> 04:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
vision I think it would be the New
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way but it would be
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
someone who's dedicated to doing that so
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
that this consistency and predictability
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
in in terms of timing and making sure
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
that new judges get what they need when
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
they come on board
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm being influenced by the fact
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
that we're sitting in the very room
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
where you would have to defend the
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
budget to division one
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
if you were given a pot of money
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the size is we don't have to
 
04:15:47.809 --> 04:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
talk about that now do you think it
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be more help
 
04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
to the effective operation
 
04:15:56.090 --> 04:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
of the Court
 
04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
to have clerks and support staff
 
04:16:08.210 --> 04:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
or to have a significantly enhanced
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
I thought that would be an easy question
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
for you I've sat in the seat for a lot
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
of budget Cycles I've never left with a
 
04:16:19.250 --> 04:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
pot of money but
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
um I think well now wait a minute wait
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait oh I've done very well
 
04:16:25.849 --> 04:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not being I'm being facetious I just
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
haven't had that pot of money I've been
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean I'm going to have chair
 
04:16:33.590 --> 04:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
leishman talk to you about this so be
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
careful no we did I'm very grateful for
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
the last budget cycle for sure we were
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful we got pretty much
 
04:16:40.849 --> 04:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
what we asked for so I I didn't mean to
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
be flipping about it
 
04:16:44.050 --> 04:16:44.060 align:start position:0%
but I think to answer your question
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I think
 
04:16:49.250 --> 04:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh the availability of law clerks would
 
04:16:51.170 --> 04:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
be a huge Improvement
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the Circuit Court in terms of
 
04:16:56.090 --> 04:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
as I said this morning the quality of
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
the orders and the timeliness of the
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
odors I think would both go up and I
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
I've used this I'll use this as a simple
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
example one of our judges
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
posted an order and this was this goes
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
back a number of years but it was a
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
relatively new judge who was writing an
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
order on a fourth amendment search with
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle misdemeanor okay but
 
04:17:16.729 --> 04:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
it's still somebody could go to jail for
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
and it was a it was a half pager with
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
one case
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh and just wanted to get some feedback
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the law was I think right and there
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
were enough facts to substantiate it but
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the spirit court that might have been
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
a six or seven page order
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know that a law clerk would have
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
researched and written and
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
so to the extent we get criticized about
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
our orders it's part of it's a time
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
crunch we've and we tell the new judges
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
this you're not
 
04:17:44.570 --> 04:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
writing orders
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
for you know
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court every time it's more
 
04:17:51.290 --> 04:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
important to get the orders out and we
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
see that in judicial evaluations the
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
judges that
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
take more time to write longer orders
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
often get criticized by the lawyers at
 
04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
least saying you know what I'd I'd
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
rather get a short order
 
04:18:07.250 --> 04:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
timely than a six-page order that you
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
know that we have to wait two months for
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I I get that
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and every judge is different the
 
04:18:15.769 --> 04:18:15.779 align:start position:0%
judges that stay off the overdue orders
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
list are the ones that have figured out
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
how to write a quicker order and get it
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
out rather than make sure that every
 
04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
single comma is in the right place and
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
um every piece of punctuation is perfect
 
04:18:32.330 --> 04:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go to oh I'm sorry I see
 
04:18:33.410 --> 04:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
that you have something you want to say
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
first go on
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to follow on to that I
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
mean I guess
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
what if it could be
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
a tiny bit of both and that you could
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
get your
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
training coordinator instead of a
 
04:18:50.210 --> 04:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
college a whole college and then you
 
04:18:50.220 --> 04:18:50.990 align:start position:0%
college a whole college and then you
could

04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps get some law clerks would that
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps be
 
04:18:58.250 --> 04:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
a better Direction because then if
 
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
you've got the coordinator to to put
 
04:19:00.060 --> 04:19:01.429 align:start position:0%
you've got the coordinator to to put
through

04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know to to organize all the training
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
for you but then you've got some clerks
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
that can help with writing orders
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
because we know that judges are
 
04:19:11.150 --> 04:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
currently writing orders from home and
 
04:19:13.130 --> 04:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
they don't really have anybody to and
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
especially in the Pro Se family court
 
04:19:16.849 --> 04:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
cases to kind of go through and help
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
flag hey these are really important
 
04:19:20.090 --> 04:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
pieces that you want to make sure you
 
04:19:23.090 --> 04:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
look at in this file what do you sounds
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
like a a good compromise to me
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that I think some of
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is is doing a
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
little PR education indicating you do
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
not propose a New Hampshire
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
judicial College because that sounds
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
like it's next thing you know you're
 
04:19:44.809 --> 04:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
going to build a building with columns
 
04:19:47.809 --> 04:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
in front so be careful of what you call
 
04:19:49.969 --> 04:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
it you just want a little New Hampshire
 
04:19:49.979 --> 04:19:52.610 align:start position:0%
it you just want a little New Hampshire
but

04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:19:52.620 --> 04:19:53.769 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:19:53.769 --> 04:19:53.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
another component of this which
 
04:20:01.130 --> 04:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
is of concern to me is what I call and
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps not precisely enough
 
04:20:03.000 --> 04:20:04.849 align:start position:0%
perhaps not precisely enough
accountability

04:20:04.849 --> 04:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's one thing
 
04:20:11.450 --> 04:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
when a red flag goes up because
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
something clearly was done that was
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in terms of whether it's
 
04:20:18.120 --> 04:20:19.490 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in terms of whether it's
uh

04:20:19.490 --> 04:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:22.729 --> 04:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
the legal appropriateness or
 
04:20:27.050 --> 04:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
Behavior or whatever it happens to be
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
but that's going to be very few cases
 
04:20:34.969 --> 04:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
and very few judges what concerns me is
 
04:20:36.849 --> 04:20:36.859 align:start position:0%
the routine
 
04:20:36.859 --> 04:20:38.410 align:start position:0%
the routine
accountability

04:20:38.410 --> 04:20:38.420 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
knowing day in and day out
 
04:20:43.020 --> 04:20:44.330 align:start position:0%
knowing day in and day out
that

04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
everything that you do as a judge
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
is really
 
04:20:49.680 --> 04:20:52.010 align:start position:0%
is really
um sacred

04:20:52.010 --> 04:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
um sacred
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
in a Democratic Society when we if we
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
believe in this and I happen to one who
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
does and I think you do too
 
04:21:04.370 --> 04:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
um so that it's even little things it
 
04:21:07.610 --> 04:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
might be a question of demeanor do you
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
realize that you are treating
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
let me give you an obvious one that you
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
were treating
 
04:21:16.969 --> 04:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
um women attorneys in a way that's
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
different from the way you're treating
 
04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
male attorneys
 
04:21:21.120 --> 04:21:22.250 align:start position:0%
male attorneys
um

04:21:22.250 --> 04:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
and it might not affect the outcome of
 
04:21:28.610 --> 04:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
the case but it affects the public
 
04:21:28.620 --> 04:21:30.590 align:start position:0%
the case but it affects the public
perception

04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
perception
 
04:21:30.600 --> 04:21:33.950 align:start position:0%
perception
and

04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
how how do you provide account of
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
routine accountability
 
04:21:43.969 --> 04:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
for those things that aren't going to
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
end up getting someone removed from the
 
04:21:46.680 --> 04:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
end up getting someone removed from the
bench

04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
bench
 
04:21:50.929 --> 04:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
but could make the difference between
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
a public perception of a careful
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
well-run judicial system and one that
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
might not be so well done yeah and
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's a fair and a great question and I
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of a conversation you and
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
I had
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
10 years ago a number of years ago well
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you can tell me the
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
year you were chair of house Judiciary
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I made a and it was an issue about
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
the ratio of women judges to men judges
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
I just want to well I think of it make
 
04:22:16.969 --> 04:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
the point that I'm very proud that with
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
these last three appointments by
 
04:22:22.250 --> 04:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
Governor sununa will be at 47 women of
 
04:22:24.170 --> 04:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
our full-time bench will be women on the
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court which I think is great
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
um but to the accountability since as I
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
understand it coming out of the law
 
04:22:33.170 --> 04:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
schools women are in the majority now is
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
that I've heard that I've heard I think
 
04:22:37.370 --> 04:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's I think the 37 of the New Hampshire
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
bar so if we're 10 ahead of that in our
 
04:22:42.769 --> 04:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
bench I think that's a great sign
 
04:22:44.090 --> 04:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and I'm proud of that but the
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
accountability is
 
04:22:48.650 --> 04:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
um hugely important and
 
04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
first of all New Hampshire is a small
 
04:22:50.160 --> 04:22:51.710 align:start position:0%
first of all New Hampshire is a small
state

04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:22:53.450 --> 04:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
what we do judicial evaluations every
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
three years as you know and we were on
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
that committee together for a number of
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
years we revamped the
 
04:23:03.530 --> 04:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the survey instrument
 
04:23:03.540 --> 04:23:06.290 align:start position:0%
um the survey instrument
um

04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.170 --> 04:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
rarely do I get a Judicial evaluation
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
when I'm surprised
 
04:23:13.370 --> 04:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
let me just say that because it's a
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
small state a lawyer's talk the lawyers
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
and the self-represented people are not
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
shy about either emailing me mailing me
 
04:23:23.929 --> 04:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
calling me when they have an issue and
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's so easy today if I get a call or
 
04:23:29.090 --> 04:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
someone says you know the judge was rude
 
04:23:30.530 --> 04:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
to me or the judge did this or that
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
within a matter of
 
04:23:35.450 --> 04:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
depending on what staff's available in
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
the building but usually within an hour
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
or two I can have the audio from that
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
hearing on my laptop and I can listen to
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
it which is the first thing that the
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct commission does when
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
they get a complaint they call us we
 
04:23:50.689 --> 04:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
have a good relationship we send them
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
the audio either electronically or on a
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
CD and most of the complaints go away
 
04:23:57.410 --> 04:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
because no the judge didn't swear at the
 
04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
person the judge didn't raise their
 
04:23:58.739 --> 04:23:59.929 align:start position:0%
person the judge didn't raise their
voice

04:23:59.929 --> 04:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
voice
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
but we do take that very seriously and
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
when there are issues
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
I either pick up the phone or I drive to
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
the courthouse and have a chat with the
 
04:24:10.130 --> 04:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
judge that's that's I think an important
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
part of my job to make sure that those
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
are nipped in the bud especially with a
 
04:24:17.929 --> 04:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
new judge that they develop good habits
 
04:24:17.939 --> 04:24:18.889 align:start position:0%
new judge that they develop good habits
um

04:24:18.889 --> 04:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:20.650 --> 04:24:20.660 align:start position:0%
so the judicial
 
04:24:20.660 --> 04:24:22.450 align:start position:0%
so the judicial
accountability

04:24:22.450 --> 04:24:22.460 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation process is sort of going on
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
04:24:28.010 --> 04:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court and I think the
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
do you wait for a let's use a gentle
 
04:24:39.889 --> 04:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
term a concern to be raised or are there
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
retired judges that spot sit in
 
04:24:43.319 --> 04:24:44.450 align:start position:0%
retired judges that spot sit in
different

04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:24:44.460 --> 04:24:46.250 align:start position:0%
different
courtrooms

04:24:46.250 --> 04:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
courtrooms
 
04:24:48.729 --> 04:24:48.739 align:start position:0%
so the the short answer is at this time
 
04:24:53.330 --> 04:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
I do wait until I hear something we have
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
going back to when Ed Kelly was the
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
administrative judge we have had
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
conversations about using retired judges
 
04:25:02.929 --> 04:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
to just and I think the new judges would
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
welcome this frankly
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
and we experienced judge to just sit in
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
the courtroom for a day or two make some
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
notes and then go into Chambers and say
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know I saw this I saw that we we did
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
an interesting
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
um program probably 15 or more years ago
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
and Ned Gordon judge Gordon then was one
 
04:25:23.330 --> 04:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
of the judges who volunteered just put a
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
video camera in the back of a courtroom
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
of a number of courtrooms around the
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
state including Ned Gordon's courtroom
 
04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then we use those videos at a
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
training for judges and I'm not going to
 
04:25:35.929 --> 04:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
pick on Judge Gordon just because he's
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
not here because he's he would he's
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
heard this before but he was on the
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
bench and he had there were two hearings
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
that came to mind one was the domestic
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
violence hearing
 
04:25:49.490 --> 04:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
and when the victim was testifying he
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
was paying close attention
 
04:25:54.170 --> 04:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
and when the defendant was testifying he
 
04:25:56.210 --> 04:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
would he seemed to be not paying as
 
04:25:58.250 --> 04:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
close attention and the perception to
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
somebody watching that video was that
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
judge Gordon wasn't listening to the
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
other side I know he was
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and then there was another case that
 
04:26:09.290 --> 04:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
was kind of going on and his head was
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
down and what he said he was doing was
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
he was ruling on a stack of warrants
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
that were on the bench he was listening
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
but he was sort of multitasking but
 
04:26:21.649 --> 04:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
again if you're watching the video your
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
perception is just not listening to
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
anything I'm saying so that was very
 
04:26:31.010 --> 04:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
eye-opening for judges uh we should we
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
should probably try to do more of that
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
the video cameras are not expensive and
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to manage it and do it
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a pretty good training tool but
 
04:26:44.330 --> 04:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
ideally we would use retired judges who
 
04:26:46.250 --> 04:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
we would um
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
recognize as someone that would be good
 
04:26:51.410 --> 04:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
at it to go watch new judges and provide
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
feedback the problem is they're all
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
sitting for us right now because we need
 
04:26:55.199 --> 04:26:56.510 align:start position:0%
sitting for us right now because we need
them

04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:26:56.520 --> 04:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
them
um

04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:59.090 --> 04:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
but I think that would be a great tool I
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
think you refer to that as maybe
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring a monitor or something
 
04:27:06.290 --> 04:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
like that yeah if I may we had a
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about my role as executive
 
04:27:10.849 --> 04:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
director of a medical center when we get
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
students coming in
 
04:27:16.969 --> 04:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
I'm right on that to see my gosh
 
04:27:21.130 --> 04:27:21.140 align:start position:0%
today you saw seven people with serious
 
04:27:24.290 --> 04:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
diagnoses three of whom reminded you of
 
04:27:26.809 --> 04:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
loved ones how you doing
 
04:27:30.050 --> 04:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get on that right away
 
04:27:32.809 --> 04:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
and teach them how to be very present to
 
04:27:35.570 --> 04:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
the moment but at the end of the day put
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
it in the drawer and go home and think
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
of other things you will either become
 
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
cold and clinical or you will
 
04:27:43.610 --> 04:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
self-medicate or something won't work
 
04:27:46.010 --> 04:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
right for you and therefore your patient
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
care so I'm very keen on monitoring
 
04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
um our young young people coming through
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
us and again just kudos to you I raised
 
04:27:58.010 --> 04:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
the issue I think I raised it with the
 
04:28:00.889 --> 04:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
chief maybe with you I'm familiar quite
 
04:28:02.450 --> 04:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
a bit with post-traumatic stress
 
04:28:04.010 --> 04:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
disorder in my work with the fire
 
04:28:07.570 --> 04:28:07.580 align:start position:0%
department and if you have had numbers
 
04:28:11.210 --> 04:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
of traumatic experiences maybe they
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to you but they happened
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
to somebody and you were observing there
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
will be takeaways and down the road
 
04:28:19.729 --> 04:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
something will trigger and you may not
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
make the connection it may be
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
subconscious but something will trigger
 
04:28:25.849 --> 04:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
a recollection back to one or more of
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
those events and you you will act
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
accordingly and I'm just saying
 
04:28:31.370 --> 04:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
especially in Family Court where you're
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
hearing all of these things all day
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
it may trigger something in the judge's
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
own life or a loved one of the judges
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
and so on and I I do encourage you along
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
the way as you're building your team of
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
people for supervision and
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
accountability to have a mental health
 
04:28:50.450 --> 04:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
person who's familiar with that to help
 
04:28:52.729 --> 04:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
judges watch for the signs in themselves
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
as well well and that's a that's a great
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
comment um with the idea of secondary
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
trauma not only for judges but for staff
 
04:29:00.889 --> 04:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
is a real thing and I can think of one
 
04:29:02.570 --> 04:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
instance specifically I remember that
 
04:29:04.849 --> 04:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
well the judge a judge calling me on the
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
weekend and had been managing this abuse
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
neglect case for a number of months and
 
04:29:11.090 --> 04:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
the mother was doing great she was in
 
04:29:12.889 --> 04:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
treatment she was you know recovering
 
04:29:14.809 --> 04:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
and he felt like he was having a
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
positive effect on this family and over
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
the weekend he heard that she had used
 
04:29:20.570 --> 04:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
again an overdosed and died and he
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
thought it was his fault you know and he
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
was very upset
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and you know I was trying to walk him
 
04:29:29.570 --> 04:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
through and convince him that it wasn't
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
your fault and and another time I had
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
someone who works in our dictation
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
Center all our orders are typed that
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
judges that use the dictation Center and
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
the staff person came in was crying and
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
she had been following this family by
 
04:29:44.090 --> 04:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
typing orders and all of a sudden she's
 
04:29:46.370 --> 04:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
typing away and someone died from an
 
04:29:48.769 --> 04:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose and it was just very
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
upsetting because she was sort of
 
04:29:53.090 --> 04:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
through the lens of these court orders
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
following the life of this family that
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
looked like everything's going to be
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay and all of a sudden it's not so we
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
are doing trainings around secondary
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
trauma for staff and judges but we can
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.010 --> 04:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
what about I don't know how to work what
 
04:30:15.849 --> 04:30:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
handling these
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
traumatic difficult painful cases is
 
04:30:27.170 --> 04:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
there any opportunity for a break
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
in that in terms of the cases that they
 
04:30:31.969 --> 04:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
are handling or does it become
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
impossible because you don't have enough
 
04:30:36.889 --> 04:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
judges no I think we try to rotate
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
judges and
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
I if you remember back when we
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
at Kelly and I testified House Bill 609
 
04:30:48.530 --> 04:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
our our vision of initially of the
 
04:30:51.290 --> 04:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court our vision not really know
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
what we were talking about because it
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
came to be so quickly was that there
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
would be these three divisions and you
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be in the Criminal Division for a
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
rotation a year or two years and then
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
you go to the Family Division and then
 
04:31:04.130 --> 04:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
you go to the probate Division and it
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
sounded good in practice it doesn't work
 
04:31:10.010 --> 04:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
except in the very largest courts
 
04:31:12.410 --> 04:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
because all of our medium and small
 
04:31:16.130 --> 04:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
courts just have have to do everything
 
04:31:19.250 --> 04:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
but we do take judges off the family
 
04:31:21.410 --> 04:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
cases for respite from time to time put
 
04:31:23.090 --> 04:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
them in the Criminal Division
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
put them in hopefully we'll attract some
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
to the probate division but there are
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
Judges like judge Lemire
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
who is very good at family and that's
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
what she wants to do and
 
04:31:36.170 --> 04:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
frankly I haven't tried to talk her out
 
04:31:38.090 --> 04:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
of it and she takes on some of the more
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
difficult cases that's just her
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse she signed up to be a marital
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
Master knowing the work and we have a
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
few of those judges that I'm grateful
 
04:31:45.899 --> 04:31:50.630 align:start position:0%
few of those judges that I'm grateful
for

04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
so regarding the having the camera and
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
giving feedback I visited the Manchester
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
Court and I realized that there was a
 
04:31:57.600 --> 04:31:59.149 align:start position:0%
Court and I realized that there was a
the

04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:02.210 --> 04:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
security team had a video of the
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
courtroom that was going on as well as
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
audio that was going on so I guess in
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
the courts that do currently have that
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
going on as part of their security
 
04:32:12.530 --> 04:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
system would that be something that
 
04:32:12.540 --> 04:32:14.630 align:start position:0%
system would that be something that
perhaps

04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
could be reviewed from time to time just
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know to see if
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know things are being checked into I
 
04:32:23.929 --> 04:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
guess so the video is bit the video
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
cameras are video only for security the
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
audio is the record from the court so to
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
marry the two up I think I'm not sure
 
04:32:32.570 --> 04:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
that would work
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
we the so the cameras that you see in
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
the lobbies and in the quorums are not
 
04:32:40.490 --> 04:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
so in Manchester they were playing the
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
audio in the lobby that were one of the
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
courts that they were watching the
 
04:32:47.330 --> 04:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
hearing at the same time are you saying
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
that even though the audio was playing
 
04:32:50.809 --> 04:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't recording
 
04:32:53.929 --> 04:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
this recording on the FTR the the for
 
04:32:56.090 --> 04:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
the record recording equipment in the
 
04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
room but that's not
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
a camera that's recording it
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously so you'd have the
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
audio outside of the courtroom though
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
it would be coming through the PA system
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's attached to the microphones but
 
04:33:11.279 --> 04:33:12.590 align:start position:0%
that's attached to the microphones but
not

04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:33:14.810 --> 04:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I mean oh it's not recorded
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
so it was through a PA microphone okay
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
right the videos are important though if
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
we have I mean typically security issues
 
04:33:23.929 --> 04:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
um if something happens in altercation
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom that's really why those
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
are there those are the really for
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
security not for audio video recording
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
of the hearings so there is no audio on
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
those video recordings correct thank you
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
we want to help I I think you know that
 
04:33:47.520 --> 04:33:48.289 align:start position:0%
we want to help I I think you know that
um

04:33:48.289 --> 04:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
I think you know I wouldn't be part of
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
specific suggestions
 
04:34:04.250 --> 04:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
that you would like to make either now
 
04:34:09.849 --> 04:34:09.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
where you see what the legislature
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
could do to help and because the two
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
categories they're things where the
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
legislature might say of course this is
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
This falls on your Turf but it seems to
 
04:34:29.949 --> 04:34:29.959 align:start position:0%
us that you might want to try X Y or Z
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
where we have no authority to pass
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislation nor should we but
 
04:34:39.289 --> 04:34:39.299 align:start position:0%
representing the citizens of the state
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
we see some things that maybe you should
 
04:34:44.449 --> 04:34:44.459 align:start position:0%
look at that's one category
 
04:34:47.090 --> 04:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
then there's a category of things that
 
04:34:47.100 --> 04:34:48.470 align:start position:0%
then there's a category of things that
clearly

04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
fall on our side of the line
 
04:34:52.500 --> 04:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
fall on our side of the line
and

04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
where working with our legislative
 
04:34:57.299 --> 04:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
where working with our legislative
colleagues

04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
04:35:02.410 --> 04:35:02.420 align:start position:0%
we might be able to
 
04:35:04.369 --> 04:35:04.379 align:start position:0%
help you
 
04:35:09.289 --> 04:35:09.299 align:start position:0%
do even better in delivering Justice
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
I I know a majority and probably
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's all of the people on this special
 
04:35:25.490 --> 04:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee would like
 
04:35:28.609 --> 04:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
to do that would like to do
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
now you might not feel ready to do that
 
04:35:37.849 --> 04:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
right now you might not want to use this
 
04:35:37.859 --> 04:35:39.051 align:start position:0%
right now you might not want to use this
particular

04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
audience to do it but I would like to
 
04:35:46.369 --> 04:35:46.379 align:start position:0%
very formally from this committee you
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
know looking at training education
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
supervision and accountability all of
 
04:35:54.170 --> 04:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
which I think address the quality
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
of of the delivery of of Justice
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'd like to know where you who know
 
04:36:04.609 --> 04:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
this much better than we do
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
would make some suggestions
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
so I am grateful for the invitation the
 
04:36:15.289 --> 04:36:15.299 align:start position:0%
way the branch operates is that we work
 
04:36:17.631 --> 04:36:17.641 align:start position:0%
with the Supreme Court and we formulate
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
our asks through that mechanism so I
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
will certainly and by the way the Chief
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
Justice I think wanted to come this
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
morning with the hit oral argument so
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um he was aware that we're here today
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
and I think would have come butt for
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
that fact so I will
 
04:36:32.879 --> 04:36:34.551 align:start position:0%
that fact so I will
definitely

04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
um get together with him and the
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
administrative Council and come to you
 
04:36:39.299 --> 04:36:40.369 align:start position:0%
administrative Council and come to you
with

04:36:40.369 --> 04:36:40.379 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:36:42.769 --> 04:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
some suggestions I think probably a lot
 
04:36:44.689 --> 04:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
of which we've already touched on today
 
04:36:48.051 --> 04:36:48.061 align:start position:0%
in terms of I just hate you know it's
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
hard to come here and keep asking for
 
04:36:51.769 --> 04:36:51.779 align:start position:0%
more because you did give us what we
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
asked for this year we asked for
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
upgraded labor grades for our staff
 
04:36:58.490 --> 04:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
for more staff positions and we ask four
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
more judges and we got that and we're
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
trying to do it incrementally so we
 
04:37:01.561 --> 04:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
trying to do it incrementally so we
don't

04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
ask for too much at once
 
04:37:08.449 --> 04:37:08.459 align:start position:0%
that relates to money and of course as
 
04:37:10.250 --> 04:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
you and you've heard me say any number
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
of times when they say it's not the
 
04:37:14.090 --> 04:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
money you know it's the money
 
04:37:14.100 --> 04:37:15.410 align:start position:0%
money you know it's the money
but

04:37:15.410 --> 04:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
um there might be other steps that we
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
could take
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
through legislation
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
um after all we created the court in the
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
um and we know we know none of those
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
courts are in the Constitution right
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and so there you know these are
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
things that we can do
 
04:37:42.769 --> 04:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
if we chose and I think we would be more
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
likely to choose if we knew that those
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
who know the most about the delivery of
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
Justice could see ways that we could do
 
04:37:51.480 --> 04:37:52.490 align:start position:0%
Justice could see ways that we could do
this

04:37:52.490 --> 04:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:37:52.500 --> 04:37:54.051 align:start position:0%
this
better

04:37:54.051 --> 04:37:54.061 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we would like to do that so it's a
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to do that and the fact
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
that this committee exists is a concern
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
to me just because there's a perception
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we could you know that there is a
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
problem and to that extent I want to be
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
able to be part of the solution
 
04:38:16.010 --> 04:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
I think I think that's true I think at
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
the big we know it's true we see I don't
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
serve on children and family I serve on
 
04:38:22.379 --> 04:38:23.650 align:start position:0%
serve on children and family I serve on
Judiciary

04:38:23.650 --> 04:38:23.660 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
so that it's only by uh observing across
 
04:38:32.449 --> 04:38:32.459 align:start position:0%
the room that I see the the bills that
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
come in to Children and Family
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and whether they are
 
04:38:40.080 --> 04:38:42.289 align:start position:0%
um and whether they are
uh

04:38:42.289 --> 04:38:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh justifiable or not whether
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
the questions that are raised are you
 
04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
know are verifiable or not is Irrelevant
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
in the system that we have
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
any legislator is free to file as many
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
bills as they choose
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
and one would hope that these bills
 
04:39:05.929 --> 04:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
would have been well researched before
 
04:39:05.939 --> 04:39:07.369 align:start position:0%
would have been well researched before
they

04:39:07.369 --> 04:39:07.379 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:39:10.131 --> 04:39:10.141 align:start position:0%
they found them but that is not a
 
04:39:13.631 --> 04:39:13.641 align:start position:0%
requirement and in many cases
 
04:39:13.641 --> 04:39:15.410 align:start position:0%
requirement and in many cases
legislature

04:39:15.410 --> 04:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
files a bill because someone asked him
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
or her to do so and then drops that bill
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
committee desk and expects the committee
 
04:39:26.100 --> 04:39:27.170 align:start position:0%
committee desk and expects the committee
to

04:39:27.170 --> 04:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
make a gold out of chaff and that's not
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
the committee's responsibility either
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson struggles with this and
 
04:39:39.530 --> 04:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's out of all of that because he wants
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing and I'll ask that
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
this committee was formed and
 
04:39:45.000 --> 04:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
this committee was formed and
um

04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
we have succeed I hope we've succeeded
 
04:39:56.030 --> 04:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
in putting many of the concerns in
 
04:39:58.990 --> 04:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate perspective
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing the pain the distress the
 
04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
unhappiness in any individual might feel
 
04:40:08.090 --> 04:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
but also recognizing that that's not
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily affecting or reflective of
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
the entire core
 
04:40:18.050 --> 04:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
and so what we want to do now is say
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay what can we do working together to
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
make it better
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that you will not just
 
04:40:26.340 --> 04:40:28.130 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that you will not just
wait

04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
wait
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
and think that oh well they're sure to
 
04:40:33.410 --> 04:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
see what needs to be done
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
because that's as much as we would like
 
04:40:36.600 --> 04:40:37.550 align:start position:0%
because that's as much as we would like
to

04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:40:43.368 --> 04:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
a couple of things number one
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
um you can say to the Chief Justice that
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
I certainly forgive him for not being
 
04:40:52.010 --> 04:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
here because the last three times he and
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
I were together he gave me a law book
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
each time and I'm two books behind and
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
and I just need a little bit more time
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
myself secondly the etiology of this
 
04:41:03.890 --> 04:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
committee was that we had some bills
 
04:41:05.868 --> 04:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
that came to children and family law
 
04:41:05.878 --> 04:41:07.550 align:start position:0%
that came to children and family law
that

04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
um let's just say it didn't look like
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial system that I know a little
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
bit about and I spoke to the speaker
 
04:41:17.930 --> 04:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
about it and he said let's form this
 
04:41:22.250 --> 04:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
special committee and in part it will
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
get bipartisan and cross the age span
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
and freshmen and Veterans and so on all
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the different topics and
 
04:41:35.810 --> 04:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
coming to our conclusions as to what we
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
think the Judiciary is doing which I
 
04:41:40.850 --> 04:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
think most of us think it's doing pretty
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
good but also use the occasion to say
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
hey let's have a dialogue about how we
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
can make a good thing better that's this
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
initial conversation I had with the
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
speaker that led to this committee being
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
formed and that's why I'm taking this
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
and a collaborative and not anticipant
 
04:42:02.510 --> 04:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that one manner you will never hear
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
me say we can't do things better I know
 
04:42:06.490 --> 04:42:06.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to suggestions and I'm
 
04:42:08.330 --> 04:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
excited about the opportunity to
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
collaborate and try to come up with some
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
solutions that we can that maybe don't
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
cost money but
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.810 --> 04:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean I believe I heard you
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
talk about two areas that maybe did cost
 
04:42:25.368 --> 04:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
money and that was the you know judicial
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
training coordinator and then perhaps
 
04:42:29.090 --> 04:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
the law clerks and I think and I don't
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to speak for her but I think what
 
04:42:34.610 --> 04:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
our our Madam chairwoman was also
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
discussing was there if there's any
 
04:42:39.530 --> 04:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
policy areas that perhaps if the policy
 
04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
areas were looked at a bit if they would
 
04:42:45.050 --> 04:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
if that would enable you to perhaps
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
improve the quality of Justice that's
 
04:42:48.050 --> 04:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's coming out is there anything
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
that's kind of tying judges hands where
 
04:42:51.650 --> 04:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
they're like
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
hey I don't I really don't think this is
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
fair but I have to issue this order
 
04:42:58.368 --> 04:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
because that's the way that it's that's
 
04:43:01.610 --> 04:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
the way that the statues written so if
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
there's if you can kind of think about
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
that in some ways and I do think
 
04:43:07.010 --> 04:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know if we're making some
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations out of this committee
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd certainly some things are always
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
about the money and we can't we can't
 
04:43:14.750 --> 04:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
have an unlimited bucket of money but I
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
think we do have some leeway for some
 
04:43:19.730 --> 04:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
things if they're really urgent and we
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
do need to to do them that
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't necessarily have to wait
 
04:43:25.610 --> 04:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
until the next budget if something was
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
really needed so I just I kind of wanted
 
04:43:27.240 --> 04:43:28.310 align:start position:0%
really needed so I just I kind of wanted
to

04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
put that into perspective
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
I do want to make clear that that last
 
04:43:38.448 --> 04:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
comment has not been discussed with
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.890 --> 04:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
well actually it has Madam chairwoman
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
because I see him at least weekly and
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the subject of what I want him to do in
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
the next budget for the Judiciary is an
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation it's the next
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
budget not this but
 
04:44:00.060 --> 04:44:01.850 align:start position:0%
budget not this but
hahaha

04:44:01.850 --> 04:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
hahaha
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
I will say that when we were here for
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
division one chairman Wallace sat in
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
that chair and I reminded him that he
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
was chair of house finance when we
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
created the circuit court and we made a
 
04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
lot of promises and I think we kept them
 
04:44:16.850 --> 04:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
all in terms of the multi-millions of
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
dollars that we
 
04:44:21.410 --> 04:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
cut and have continued to save
 
04:44:23.690 --> 04:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
I feel a little bit responsible I think
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
we cut too deeply at the time and it's a
 
04:44:27.410 --> 04:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
lot harder to get things back than it is
 
04:44:30.170 --> 04:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
to give them up but with that said the
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislature's been very good to us in
 
04:44:33.650 --> 04:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
the last few budget cycles and so I have
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
no complaints about that I remember
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
touring the the telephone Center well as
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
you hear Chicago and we've taken 5
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
million calls
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
and we didn't lose a call during covet
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
even in that first week we moved people
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
out with their cell phones and we didn't
 
04:44:52.010 --> 04:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
drop a call so that's a success story
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
too that I'm very proud of we have taken
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
so much of your time today and I feel
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
really guilty about it because Justice
 
04:45:02.570 --> 04:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
delayed is Justice denied but is there
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%

04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
