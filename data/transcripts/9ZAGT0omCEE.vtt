working
 
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
session um the reason we have a lot of
 
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
pink cards is for our uh administrative
 
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
purposes to make sure that we know what
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
potential resources are here that we can
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
recognize to help us understand uh the
 
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
different sides to this issue issue HB
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
229 uh which is with regard
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
to not allowing our National Guard New
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard to be activated
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh short of a declaration of war and so
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
our clerk representative Kerrie
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
appreciates uh these pink cards for uh
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
clerk purposes the cards will not be
 
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
turned in uh as as they would be during
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing so just so that is clear
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
um so we will uh so we're not o obliged
 
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
to recognize anyone again this is a
 
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
working session but I appreciate you

um have some of you amplify or help us
 
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 align:start position:0%

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
of this before we go to Executive
 
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
session executive session is scheduled
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%

until 10:30 but I am quite sure that we
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
will go well past 10:30 uh as we try to
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%

chartered by state law uh we have 20
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
members to speak for the veteran
 
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire and every
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
year as chairman of their legislative
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee I look through all the bills
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
that have better an impact we take a
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
position on them and then I come and I
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
tell you all what our position is on
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we unanimously uh oppose this
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we uh took another vote
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
last Tuesday to see if we wanted to
 
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
revisit our position on this and we
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
again were unanimously opposed uh to
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation um I want to start out
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
by saying that that title 10 of US law
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
is really uh the uh the guard rails here
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
it it governs how Reserve forces which
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
the na New Hampshire National Guard is
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
are called up and activated uh to active
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
military service uh for those of you
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
that are really not that familiar with
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
the military I will tell you one thing
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
that should should sort of be in your
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
thought process as you think about this
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay when we have someone off the street
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
walk in to our National Guard or our
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
Army National Guard okay the first thing
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
that we do with that person is we send
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
them to basic training okay that person
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
goes to Regular active duty basic
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
training there's no such thing as a
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
guard basic training okay same thing for
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
their follow-on skill position they
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
train right alongside of their
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
counterparts who are on active duty you
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
literally cannot tell the difference in
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
a in any given room and that's the same
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
relationship that we have if guard and
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
Reserve forces are called to active duty
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
by the National command Authority in
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
accordance with title 10 they move in
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
right alongside their active duty folks
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
they are essentially active duty people
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're paid like active duty people and
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
and and they go from there um we we we
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem in this bill with the
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
idea that that that Congress hasn't done
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
their job because we haven't declared
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
boore since
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
1943 and while acknowledging that that
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
is in fact true okay we also have to
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that 81 years have passed
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
since then okay back in 1942 we had to
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
have when it was a call to war we had to
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
activate the entire economy Rosie the
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
Riveter went to the went to the uh
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
factories because there weren't enough
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
men because why the men were drafted and
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
off they went to war people were told I
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
know you'd like to make truck tires but
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
you've got to make airplane
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
tires as the world's Premier economic
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
superpower and arguably the world's
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
Premier military superpower we don't
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
need to do that anymore and so how does
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
Congress exercise their control over
 
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
this because they control the money and
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
as a result of the Vietnam experience
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
the Congress decided to take some of
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
that control back with the with the War
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
Powers Resolution which was passed in
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
November of 1973 over President Nixon's
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
veto by the way just so that you know
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
they overrode his veto and it became law
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it basically says if you're going to
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
send folks out somewhere for more than
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
60 days with a 30-day redeployment
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
period you've got to come tell us what
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
you're doing and and otherwise we'll cut
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the money off so if you look at recent
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
history President George HW Bush got a
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
an authorization to use military force
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
before Desert Storm President George W
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
bush got authorizations to use military
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
force before operations in Afghanistan
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
and Iraq now Congress could take that
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
authorization back anytime they want to
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
the fact that they haven't is not not a
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
discussion for for your committee
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily okay that's that's one for
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
everything else um there isn't any
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
difference when a soldier gets called to
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
active duty and it's not optional from
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the guard and the active Force okay
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
after Desert Storm when we downsized all
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
of the militaries the garden Reserve
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
forces became a musthave and not a nice
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
to have back in the day when I was in
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
the Air Force millions of years ago okay
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
what did the guard have for airplanes
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
they had the airplanes the active duty
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
didn't want anymore okay what does our
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
guard have for airplanes they got the KC
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
46 the latest and greatest tanker in the
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
Air Force okay there are plenty of KC
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
135 pilots flying an airplane that's
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
twice as old as they are out there right
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
now that wish they were flying those KC
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
46s same song across the border in
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont flying the F35 over there so the
 
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
garden Reserve forces because we're
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to need them on an occasional
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
basis to support our operations are
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
equipped with our latest and greatest
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
Munitions and they're trained at active
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
duty schools so that there is no seam
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
between a guard person and an active
 
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
between a guard person and an active
duty

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
duty
 
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
person so everybody should know when
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
they sign on to the guard and the
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
reserve that there's an not there's a
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
possibility that you're going to end up
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
in a combat zone and that could happen
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
if whether we declare war or not so it
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
it it's a little bit of a distinction
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
without a difference um because the
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
national command Authority has this
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
ability to call these folks up because
 
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
the governor is not in the loop on that
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
the governor gets
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
consulted for for regular scheduled
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
deployments the governor knows a couple
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
years out and everybody's all on the
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
same page it's not like we're trying to
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
to hide anything here but the guard and
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the reserve forces that we have in our
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
country right now are must-have and and
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
we can't have a you know a regulation
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
that says we're we're not going to
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
follow what the federal statutes are
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay at the end of the day our our
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
opposition in the state veterans
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
advisory committee is a lot about we're
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
rule followers we're in the military
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
forever the military has rules when this
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
when this is what the rule says we
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
follow the rules okay the place to
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
change title 10 of US law if we want to
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
make that change is at the federal level
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's not at the state level okay you
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
know the we've got those great airplanes
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
over at peas you know
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
um could they do that job from Cape cot
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
or Portland sure they could sure they
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
could okay we're all we're all kidding
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves if we don't think that they
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't okay but what we also don't
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
want to do we don't want to create I'm
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the guard so I'm special I'm in the
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
guard so I shouldn't have to go and take
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
my turn in the barrel like the active
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
duty guy even though I'm going to be on
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
active duty when I do that I shouldn't
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
have to do that we we don't want to we
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to send that message and I
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
think that's what that's what the state
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee would like
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
you to know today is that we have to
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
follow the rules it's clearly written
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
down in plain English in title 10 of US
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
law and if you want to change this
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
you've got to change it at the federal
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
level so subject to any of your
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
questions sir I'll get off the stage and
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
let somebody else
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr Grady so you said you
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
would take questions yes sir and and I
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
have several and we and so does let's
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
start here with uh with representative
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh when you mentioned
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
in your in your testimony here you say
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we follow the rules in the United
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
States Constitution that the delegated
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
power for war making is very is
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
explicitly outlined and handed to
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
Congress for the exact purpose that uh
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
the people should be the ones to with
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
this uh the last voice when it comes to
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
the uh War making ability do do you
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
believe that us right now using aums are
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
following the rules
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
I do I I believe that that Congress has
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
the ability at any is there only one
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
person I must did I turn this off if I
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
did I'm sorry uh you okay um the the the
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
Congress has the ability to withdraw an
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
aumf at any time they've authorized the
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
one since 2001 to fight the global war
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
on terror basically wherever if they
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
want to make modifications to that if
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
they want to do anything with that they
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
can they can do that
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.470 align:start position:0%
can they can do that
tomorrow

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
follow up follow so the the so when when
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
the Congress uh passed the War Powers
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
Resolution they have now subd delegated
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
their constitutional authority over to
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
the executive branch which is arguably
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
and the argument of this entire bill is
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
that that is unconstitutional so 81
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
years of us not following the
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution since World War II you
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
would not see that as a conflict I I I
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
would argue on the other side that the
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
the tonen Gulf resolution that was
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
1964 was essentially Congress giving the
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
president a blank check to go out and do
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
whatever he decided to do and the War
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
Powers Act of 1973 was Congress deciding
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's a bad idea we have to retain that
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
capability in the Congress and so
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
therefore we're going to pass laws that
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
are are realistic okay nobody nobody
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
there was no such thing as an aircraft
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
carrier or something like that back when
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
the the founding fathers wrote this
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
document nobody realized the global
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
reach and Global power that we have from
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
our Naval and Air Forces anywhere in the
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
world and so it's not like we have to
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
wait you know and build up an army and
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
and and have it send it on a on a six
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
week sale to get it somewhere okay we've
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
got forces all over the world that can
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
be ready to protect our interests on a
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
moment's notice and I think that that
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
that was a an attempt by the Congress to
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
say okay wait a minute we understand you
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
have a job to do Mr President uh but we
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
need to be able to control this to some
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
degree we're just not giving you a blank
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
check anymore and I think that's what
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
they did did with that act excellent
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
another followup another
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
followup all right this thing does turn
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
itself off so the uh as you mentioned
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the blank check of the Gulf of tonen
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
resolution the 2001 aumf is very
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
arguably a clone of that exact thing
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's no outlined um targets there's
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
no outlined Victory conditions no
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
outlined countries we've used it as an
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
excuse to invade over 22 countries and
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
largely classified this is not exposed
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
not visible to the American taxpayer uh
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
We've uh caused coups and other
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
countries with the training with the
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
money used under the 2001 aumf you don't
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
see that as as a repeat of the mistake
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
70s again representative I I keep having
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
to go back to the fact that that if the
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
Congress of the United States allows
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
this to go to happen which which they
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
have by this a aumf then you know could
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
you end up with situations like this you
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
know the countries you're talking about
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
they there there weren't any incursion
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
that are there couldn't be any urss
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
longer than 60 days of significant
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
amounts of forces without again going
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
back to the going back to the Congress
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
and getting an authorization uh a
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
specific authorization for that action
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
so I I think I think the
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
aumf could could we do things to make
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
that stronger and more limited certainly
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay is is that our place to to
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
legislate that from down here in conquer
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
we don't think so we think that place to
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislate that is in DC with our elected
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor thank you representative
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
recognized um thank you for being with
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
us as always
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
um United States has a mutual defense
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
treaty with nor with South Korea and we
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
have thousands a troop stationed in
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
Korea as we know in
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
1951 Kim jong's grandfather invaded
 
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.669 align:start position:0%
1951 Kim jong's grandfather invaded
South

00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
South
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
Korea to to keep our American soldiers
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
stationed there out of he's way wouldn't
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
it be imperative to mobilize the
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
National Guard to backfill positions so
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
more active Dy military could go into
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
that combat
 
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.189 align:start position:0%
that combat
zone

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
zone
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
question well well sir that that is a
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's a a question for a diplomat
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
probably more so I thought you were than
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
me no no sir I'm uh I'm just a I'm just
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
a lowly fighter pilot you know I want to
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
pass I do kind of what I'm told on that
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
but no the uh I I've I've never been
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
stationed in Korea I've been stationed
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
on okanawa where our job was defense of
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
Korea and I've been to Korea on on
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions and and they take
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
their they take their sovereignty very
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
seriously they they land airplanes on on
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
on roads two or three times a year just
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
to prove they can do it and and so I I
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
understand that I think anybody that's
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
ever been to Korea would come back with
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing that how seriously they
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
take their own defense and for the most
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
part they're pretty happy to have us
 
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
part they're pretty happy to have us
there

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
now again a diplomat question are we are
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
we there to you know keep uh Kim Jong uh
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
un from doing something or we there to
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
just be there in case we need needed in
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
China or Taiwan or some other place
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
again we could get into a that's a we
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
followup say it's better when the mic's
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
off when I speak but
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh I won't ask for a vote on that but uh
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
this is more would you believe um in
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
1861 after the fall of Ford sua
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
President Lincoln would you believe
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
called up as for 75,000 volunteers to
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
serve in the Union forces state militias
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
were brought up and put into Federal
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
units to um to make war against the
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
Confederacy Congress never declared war
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the Confederate States of America do
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
you believe that under this if this Bill
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
had passed a similar circumstance that
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
happened in this country during the
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
Civil War that the New Hampshire State
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
militia now National Guard would have be
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
in the same parent not be able to uh to
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
come to the aid of uh our country and
 
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
come to the aid of uh our country and
our

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.149 align:start position:0%
our
president

00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no decleared War I I
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't think so then then that said
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill you're now one
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
state out of 50 that has said we're
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
we're not going to follow the rules and
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
then we would have to see well what what
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
happens as a result of that you know is
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
there do do other states follow that do
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
does Congress make changes I I I don't I
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
can't foresee the future on that or does
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
somebody say well we we now we have 49
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
states that have the guard and Reserve
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
in them and you know that we have a 50th
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
state there that is you know it doesn't
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
have any forces and you know instead of
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
being in a position to offer our forces
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
to other states that have emergencies
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
natural disasters those kind of things
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
we won't be there to won't be there to
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
do that up here and whenever we have
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
something like that we're going to be
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
dependent on somebody else to do that
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
for us thank you yes sir thank you for
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
your service thank you
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the record I do want to point out
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I have been to Korea a couple times
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
myself uh that Korean conflict started
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
by Kim John ern's grandfather Kim Mong
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
happened in 1950 not 1951 I know that's
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
way before your time M
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh represent gag says he remembers it
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh 1950 yes uh representative
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
um Manion um is
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair uh one
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
thing I'd point out is nothing in this
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill precludes a National Defense if we
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
were to be invaded or something were to
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
attack the Homeland that that's
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
completely within the the scope of the
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
National Guard's Mission and it would
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
not be affected by the the bill
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but I do have another
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
question the um you mentioned in your
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh uh we don't want the
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
state to think or Guardsmen to have this
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
attitude of I'm with the guard so I'm
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
special but the the guard does have a
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
dual Mission That's Unique versus the
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
active duty military is that
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
correct the the guard does have a a
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
Mission but but I would also argue that
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
their primary mission in the National
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
Guard is whatever their active duty
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
skill set is whatever their MOS for the
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
Army or or their Air Force specialty
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
code for the Air Force is their primary
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
job is doing that job and being ready in
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
case the national command Authority
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
needs them on either a per unit basis or
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
a per person basis uh to go somewhere
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and and do something for the the
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
national command Authority so the they
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
do sort of have a a dual Allegiance but
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
um the the the one that is their is
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
their primary mission is whatever
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
whatever their skill set is for their
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
service before I go back to the co-art
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
is does anyone else uh have a question
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
for Mr Grady uh representative Horgan uh
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
we will recognize you go ahead thank you
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair make this quick I'm
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
just a guest in this committee but um we
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about how we haven't had a
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
formal declaration of war since World
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
War II and then I guess some least some
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the pron Bill feeling that was a
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
mistake and against the Constitution but
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
what did we well first of all I guess
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
during World War II we actually did
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
start intervening and deploying assets
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
even before Pearl Harbor but with the uh
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
armed conflicts us got involved with
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
before that did they all have a formal
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
declaration of war or did some of them
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
you know were authorized you know
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
somewhat informally as has been the case
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
since World War II with all our armed
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
many well you know the I I think uh
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
President Truman took great pains to say
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that this is not a war in Korea it's a
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
police action under the United Nations
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not a real historian on on
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
Vietnam I probably should be a little
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
more than I am but that's sort of
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
evolved and ramped up after the tonen
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
Gulf resolu ution in ' 64 um I was in I
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
was in junior high in high school uh
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
back then and and missed out on that
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
conflict but um the the stuff since then
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
Desert Storm I think there was a pretty
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
clear purpose for what we were doing
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
there the there was originally a a
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
purpose for the Iraq and the uh and the
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan uh arrange or in you know
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
incursions um at at some point in time
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's my personal opinion Kevin Grady's
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
opinion not shared by the svac or DOD or
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
any of those other people or Taylor
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
Swift's folks uh but the you know at
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
some point we may have lost our way a
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
little bit and included a lot of things
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
in in the aumf as representative Manion
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
says that that really and truly weren't
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
specific to the original purpose of why
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
we were doing what we were doing back in
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
2001 that said again the persons that
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
the people that need to change that are
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
Congress at that
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
level to representative Horgan's point
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous times that we
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
have uh post World War I we went to uh
 
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.070 align:start position:0%
have uh post World War I we went to uh
Haiti

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
Haiti
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
Nicaragua uh we're in Lebanon in 1957
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
and in 1983 when in in Lebanon so there
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
have been many numerous occasions where
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
we have used we deployed and used Force
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
short of a declaration of war R Manan uh
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
you had you hand up sure uh thank you Mr
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
chair I just have some questions about
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
the structure of the svac so the um the
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
the s back mission statement is what
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
what would you say that their primary
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
purpose is their their primary purpose
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
is is is is kind of generally so that
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
we've got one one one voice that speaks
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the veteran community in New
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%

report thank you
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
followup another followup go ahead so
 
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of military Affairs
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
and veteran services were only recently
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
combined into a single Department in the
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
in the State uh and that was in 2019 do
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
you know why that
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
was uh I'll give you just a little
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
history um when governor sonunu was
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
first elected governor sununu walked
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
into uh one of our state veterans
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
advisory committee meetings and his
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
first question was one we couldn't
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
answer he went if I have a problem a
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
veteran comes to me with a problem where
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
do I send him and we said well we
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
imagine that between the state veterans
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and a lot of our uh
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
people that are that meet with us all
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
the time we probably get the answer to
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
that but there really wasn't what he
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
would call a single belly button that he
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
could push to to get things done or or
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
ask a veteran related question and that
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
led to about two or three years worth of
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and bills that finally
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
culminated in in the uh it finally
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
culminated in standing up the department
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and vetor services
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
to sort of put all of the people that
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
are trying to do good things for
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
veterans all Under One Roof uh in that
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
were was commanded by the agitant
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
general and if if if uh Colonel Perry
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
has anything different he'd like to add
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%

and thank you again uh Mr Grady for
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
speaking of front I think right up front
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
here we're getting a lot of the
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
questions asked and answered that we all
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
need to hear um and we so we'll continue

I need to again remind everybody this is
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing we've had a public
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on February 3rd for this um the
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of of uh the working session is
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
what's happening right here is to get
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
some folks with some specific
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
information that'll help the committee
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
to better evaluate the the bill in in
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
totto before we have an exact session so
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh we'll come back to this and there are
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%

them certainly a chance to to speak but
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
again if if you're desire to speak is
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
simply to do what you may may have
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
already done on February 3rd and just
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
say you're in favor of the bill that's
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
not why we're here we're looking for
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%

a lot of questions the uh so the svac
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
purpose is to be the a singular voice of
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
the veterans uh I think a lot of people
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
in this committee have been been
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
receiving uh lots and lots of phone
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
calls emails from the veteran Community
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
specifically in support of this bill do
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
did did anybody of those any of those
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
voting members did they poll their
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
people that they allegedly represent uh
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
support this or not I I I know that a p
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
committer of the BFW is here uh that
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
maybe can speak to that I know
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
within my organization I I pulled the
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
members and I I didn't get I didn't get
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who's uh who spoke in favor of
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
this I got I only and to be fair I only
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
got about 10 or 12 responses but they
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
were all we support we support what the
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
svic position is on
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
this uh question for me uh Mr Grady uh
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
did I I hear you correctly did you and
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for I was going to ask the
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
same question that the representative
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
from pelum asked terms of esac State
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee who makes
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
that up and you thank you uh you
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
answered that that there's 20 different
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
components to your committee uh did I
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
hear you correctly did you say earlier
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
that the committee itself when it met
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
was unanimously opposed to the bill did
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
I hear that correctly we we we we met we
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
talked about representative Manuel was
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the at the at the meeting representa
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
Manning was was given time to speak uh
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
he engaged in some and I I don't think
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking out of turn here you
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in some questions with uh some
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
members of the audience to get some
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
clarification then we went on with the
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
rest of our meeting structure when it
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
got to my point is with the legislative
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
session and I started talking about the
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
15 bills we're going to follow for the
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
next session but then I also said hey
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
I've got a hearing next Wednesday and if
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to change our position
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
because that's why representative Manion
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
was at our meeting was to see if the
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
svac would either one withdraw our
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
objection or number two support the bill
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we we threw this thing open and
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
chairman Lloyd there in the back uh
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
asked three times do there any
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussion is there any move to change
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
our position on this bill and there was
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
no there was no movement in it at all so
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
I I take that to be a
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh unanimous consent if you
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
will because we did not want to revisit
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
our position on this thank you
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
gagy first of all thank you Mr Grady for
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
remaining in the hot seat and you're
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
answering the questions well I remember
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
Korea I was eight years old seven eight
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
years old and I followed the union
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
leader with the little arrows as we were
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
as we were being pushed by the Chinese
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
towards a chosen Reservoir and all that
 
00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.149 align:start position:0%
towards a chosen Reservoir and all that
good

00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
stuff during an undeclared war um you
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
talked about we have to follow the rules
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
and most of me agrees with that
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
following the rules but if there's
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
enough push back do you think perhaps
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the people making the rules to kind of
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
sort of review the rules and and and
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
tweak those rules so that it would be
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
more advantageous all the way around
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
including those who serve who are called
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
up every six months or every year to
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
give up their jobs and their families
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
and go there to another hot spot and
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
they come back back home for a couple
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
years then they go back to another hot
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
spot should shouldn't like the rules
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
change maybe we could stop my
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
opinion in my opinion we should stop
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
being the police policeman of the world
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and going in there and try
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
to get involved with things maybe we
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get involved with
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank well sir there's a there's a lot
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
to unpack of that question um and but I
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
guess what I would tell you is
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
um if if we shouldn't be wandering
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
around the world to your point sir being
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
the world's
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
policemen then we then our active duty
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
guys shouldn't be doing that either
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
neither should our our guard forces and
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be making this distinction
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
where we are just going to say we're not
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to go because we're we're we're in
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
the guard and the active duty guy is
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
going to go and and I think a lot of
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
what you saw if you look back to the for
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
example the the incursion into uh into
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
Iraq in 2003 okay you know by the time
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
by the time we started to send the guard
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
and Reserve forces in there most of the
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
active duty units had been in there two
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
maybe three times had already made two
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
or three trips over there and then it
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
was time to sort of start blending in
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
these uh units and at at one point I I
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
read the in the your your Journal
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
article at one point we had like 60% of
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
the people that were in country there
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
were were Garden Reserve forces well the
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
timing on that kind of worked works out
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be about their turn about once every
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
two or three times that the active duty
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
folks have to go but again we're we're
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this distinction you
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
know without a difference because when
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
you get called up to active duty via
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
tile 10 you're you're on active duty as
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
much as the active duty Soldier next to
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
you and while you might think you have a
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
a mission back home right now your
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
primary mission is supporting whatever
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
the national command Authority needs you
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
to do and it's just as inconvenient for
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
that active duty kid from New Hampshire
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
not to be here when they're needed by
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
the state as it is for the guard guy in
 
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.149 align:start position:0%
the state as it is for the guard guy in
our

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
opinion representative Manion yes so you
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned during the uh the uh 60% of
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
the people being deployed during one of
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
those instances it was uh the Louisiana
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
National Guard in particular do did you
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
know that they were deployed to Iraq
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
when Katrina hit and they were not
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
state again you know I I I wasn't
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
specifically foll following them and I
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that Katrina at least big
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
picture-wise you know U would they have
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
not sent those guys if Katrina had hit a
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
month or two months before they were
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
deployed that's a possibility that they
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
might have tried to work something else
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
out but you know once you're once you're
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
in position over there and you have a
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
disaster back home then what has to
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
happen is the folks that are still home
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
have to do it and you've got to rely on
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
your neighbors to come in and help you
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
same thing that you know we did the
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
floods in Vermont we sent our Blackhawk
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
k opter is over there to help them
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
because we rely on our neighbors to to
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
do those things for us when you know
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
they either don't have the capability or
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
Health other questions for Mr
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
Grady who has been on the hook uh for
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
quite a while thank you for your stamina
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
I have one quick one uh uh Kevin we have
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh a bill that's in the hopper with ol
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
is going to come to us uh in January
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh funding for increas in
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
recruiting bonuses for the guard uh and
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're quite aware that the guard has had
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
a tough time uh as has have most
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
services around the country have had a
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
very tough time with recruiting it's
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
part of the reason behind the bill that
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to get um so I've heard it
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
said that some folks uh want to join the
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
guard because as opposed to a a federal
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
service because they like the mission of
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
the Guard the guard is focused on uh New
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and of course has already
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
been pointed out National Guards have
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
certainly been used in in a federal
 
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
certainly been used in in a federal
capacity

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
but the notion that Guardsmen New
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Guardsmen may be deployed I
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
have heard that that has been has had a
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on at least some folks
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
who don't want to join don't join the
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
gardo because they they don't want to
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
deploy could you speak to that have you
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
heard much along those
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
lines again I'm not I'm
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
not in on all the recruiting efforts and
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
all those other things and and to your
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill that's going to
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
come in you know we're we in the svac
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
would always like to be able to help our
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
our guard folks out to recruit people I
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
believe that uh that that our members of
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
the the svac are probably our best
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
recruiters people that have have have
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
served in the military are some of our
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
best influencers is the term we would
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
use in my other line of work as a as a
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
ad missions liaison officer for the Air
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
Force Academy you know that those we
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
folks are are are influencers that way
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
um some of this stuff again you know if
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
you if you were to go to peas for
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
example and look at the tanker operation
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
over there we've we've got an active
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
duty Squadron there stood up right next
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the tanker Squadron the crews are
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
interchangeable they're doing a real
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
world mission every single day okay so I
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that those folks
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
over there in the Air National Guard at
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
peas are focused on their their their
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
title 10 Mission and less focused on you
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
know what can I do for the State of New
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the big thing about about if
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
you want to serve in the in a branch of
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
the service and you want to be taught a
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
skill by that branch and you want a lot
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that people like about
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
military service camaraderie those kind
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
of things and you want the ability to be
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
always stationed your entire life in New
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you don't have to do like I
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't if if many of you were probably on
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
active duty in the military and every
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
three years you pick up and move
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
someplace else because it's your turn in
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
the barrel to move someplace else you
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
know this is a you know joining the
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
garden the big draw there is if you love
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're going to be in New
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now are you occasionally going
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
to have to do the real world mission
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
that you were that you're trained to do
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
yes at some point you're probably going
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
to have to do that and that's just
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
something that I think our recruits need
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
to understand when they walk in the door
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
is that there's a there's always the
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
possibility you're going to be called
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
upon to do your real world
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
mission we don't necessarily know where
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
be thank you anything else from Mr
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
Grady Mr gr thank you for your uh uh
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
patience and for answering all these
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
questions I think we knocked off a lot
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the uh pieces of this that we need to
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
knock off as way we allowed the
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh so much latitude in asking
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
numerous questions uh so we want to move
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
right along and again I will repeat we
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of folks who do want to weigh
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
in we appreciate you being here and
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to honor that if we can
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
but I need to remind you this is not a
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
hearing uh you folks Mr Grady is here
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
for our pleasure to help us to give this
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
measure uh full do consideration when we
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
execute later later on so if uh those of
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
you who want to speak if all you wanted
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
to do was just say your in favor of the
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill I'm going to ask you to uh to not
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
do that uh um in fact unless you have
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
something new or Salient or relevant
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to help us something that
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't come up just now or earlier uh
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
again I need to make sure you understand
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
this is a working session not a hearing
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
that said I'd like to recognize the

welcome thank you chairman do a much
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
better job than the
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
speaker um so the uh the question about
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
section 10 and our compliance with it
 
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't do anything to take us
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
out of compliance section 10 uh National
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
Guard troops will still go to basic
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
training that's funded by the federal
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
government and they'll stand ready to be
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
deployed and Destroy uh the enemies of
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
the United States of America just as
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
they do now um it's just says that we're
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to um do it if there's a
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
declaration of war uh now the am a
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
authorized use of military force
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
questions coming up and people are
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
debating whether or not that's a
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
declaration of war or not uh but this
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't doesn't discuss that it
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
just says it has to be a declaration of
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
war so that's you know is it a
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
declaration of war or not you know I
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
tend to think it's not but that's a
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
question for the courts uh we're just
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
saying it needs to be declaration War
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is already the US is already US
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution so you know the federal
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
government seems to believe it's
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
declaration of war uh and if that's what
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
it is then that's what it is but you
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
know we're just putting our guard in and
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that it has to also be
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
a declaration war from our perspective
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
um so there would be no changes to to
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
our compliance with title 10 uh I hope
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
sense um and then uh
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
just you know pulling funds uh
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of funds and all this stuff
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
is is highlighted in title 32 so so you
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
know it's not even a title 10 issue um
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
but it's not relevant we're going to be
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
in compliance with title
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
10 um so that's just what I want to do
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
is first reframe it into what the actual
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
question is any
 
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.390 align:start position:0%
question is any
questions

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
yes perhap a
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
shli thank you uh Mr chairman and that
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
comment about the speaker is the current
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
current Speaker you were referring to
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
about the uh Excellence of our chair of
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
this Committee just for the record um uh
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
from everything I've read if we were
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
attacked today Congress can't declare
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
war can today because we don't have a
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
speaker they could take no formal action
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
they couldn't even do a resolution in
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
support of the people of Israel so what
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
would happen today are you asking if the
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would declare war according
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'll be clarifying I thank you for being
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
here if the United States if someone
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
attacked the United States we could not
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
activate the National Guard without a
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
declaration of war from Congress as of
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
today the United States Congress cannot
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
take any action because they don't have
 
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.870 align:start position:0%
take any action because they don't have
a

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
speaker okay so I mean it doesn't if
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to deploy troops or not is
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
the question right uh does the am the
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
authorized use of military force is that
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
could what I'm trying to say is if it's
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
legal to deploy troops under am
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
authorized use of military Force you
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
know this doesn't a this isn't deciding
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's legal this isn't the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
question it's just it has to be a
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
declaration of war so when it comes time
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
to deploy troops you know the governor
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
has to uh you know title 10 says it
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
actually says it has to be lo you know
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
we have to comply with it it for legal
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh lawful uh call UPS to war um when he
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
calls the troops in you know we'll have
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
to decide the court will have to decide
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
whether that was legal or not if the if
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
it was a authorized use of military
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
force whether if Congress can't declare
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
war and there's other ways of deploying
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
troops uh like it was alluded to earlier
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh in World War I they were deployed
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
before um there was a declaration of war
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
there's like a 60 day thing or something
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh then that's
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
fine follow up follow follow
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
up well then why are we entertaining
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
this bill if there are other ways to
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
activate the National Guard for 60 days
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
then what is the sense of this bill
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
because this bill says upon a
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
declaration of war by Congress then the
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
National Guard can go into
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
combat right so you could say I mean
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
what's the point of this bill there's a
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitution already says we need a
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
declaration of war right Congress
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
authorizes the War uh but some people
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe that they're not they're not in
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with that they believe that
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
the the authoriz use military force is
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
not a declaration of war um but to ask
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that question we we can't ask that we
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question here you know
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
people are trying to decide what does
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
does it imply that it's not a
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
declaration War that's what the that's
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
what the bill implies but we're we're
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
not we're not the court we're not going
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
to decide that if it's legal or not okay
 
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.069 align:start position:0%
to decide that if it's legal or not okay
thank

00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
you other questions for representative
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Sao uh representative Manion I
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
actually have the answer to that
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
question but the nothing in this bill so
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
line four or line 26 section 4 says
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill shall liit or
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
prohibit the Governor from consenting to
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the deployment of National Guard member
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
on uh title 32 section 904 that includes
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
repel Invasion and quell riots and
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
execute the laws of the nation this
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill would prevent us
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
from defending ourselves so some of this
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
back and forth right here might be
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
better suited for executive session
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
y resent fenny you have a hand up
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%

Wall came down 9 November 1989 and the

talk of a peace
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
dividend this peace dividend has been
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
realized by several reductions in the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
that plac many support units into the

restructuring the guard in Reserve are
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
an integral part of our planning for

an integral part of our planning for
National

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
and we have added the space force with a

strength of
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
8,400 these are significant reductions
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
those reductions have required the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
Pentagon to alter strategic
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
planning those shifts have involved the
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
National Guard in the reserves to

00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
Forces these missions around the world
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
accomplished without the National Guard
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
reserve do not mistake mistakenly
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
believe any large deployment of US
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
troops can happen without the support of
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
the national guard and Reserve they are
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
planning I would also like to address
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
because there was an editorial that came
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
out using several things to support this
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill and I feel it's a bit
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
misleading it cites a story about a
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
Guardsman deployed in Iraq during
 
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.549 align:start position:0%
Guardsman deployed in Iraq during
Hurricane

00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
Hurricane
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
Katrina Katrina was one of the largest
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
disasters to hit the nation in a very
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
long time in the editorial would lead
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
one to believe that the deployment of
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
the Louisiana National Guard impacted
 
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.069 align:start position:0%
the Louisiana National Guard impacted
relief

00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
efforts that just is not
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
accurate Louisiana has approximately
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
11,500 National Guardsmen which are
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
organized into 74
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
units and during the largest activation
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
and deployment of National Guard and
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
reserves during Desert Shield Desert
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%

the same
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
time that I can find and I did research
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
that in fact during Katrina Louisiana
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
National Guard pre-positioned 3,000
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
guardmen Guardsmen in and around New
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the storm hitting the Gulf
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
Coast even if no Guardsmen were deployed
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
the disaster would have overwhelmed them
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
and required
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
reinforcements it is easy to find that
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
within 96 hours of the storm 30,000
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
troops were in the area in total during
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
the disaster 43,000 National Guardsmen
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
responded to
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
Katrina and and
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
18,000 active duty troops responded to
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
Katrina the response was not affected by
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
the deployment in those troops within 96
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
hours they
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
airlifted 88,000 tons of
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
supplies and affected
 
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:54.349 align:start position:0%
supplies and affected
177,000

00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
rescues

00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
so again the deployment of the unit and
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
I went to the Louisiana National Guard
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
site and try to find out which units
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
were deployed in
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
2006 their website has no mention of a
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
deployment in
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
2006 though I don't doubt that there
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
were probably Guardsmen deployed the
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
only thing they mention in 2006 is their
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
Katrina

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
Katrina
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
this article also mentions a budget
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
alternative what is that budget
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
alternative I believe the author is
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
trying to infer that it is somehow the
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
cheaper to deploy a National Guard or
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
reserve unit compared to an active duty
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
unit but that again is not true those
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
activated must be paid the same as an
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
active duty unit to include housing
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
dependent benefits
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
if anything it's much more costly to
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
activate and deploy a guard or reserve
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
unit because a higher percentage of them
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
are married and have
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
families so there is no gimmick in the
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
budget that saves the federal government
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
money by deploying the National Guard or
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
Reserve there's talk about the executive
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
branch being able to unilaterally choose
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
military actions and theaters in order
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
to activate the guard Reserve units
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
Congress must give approval they got to
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
at least declare a national emergency
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
and they still control the pur strings
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
which they can shut off at any
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
time there is no unrestrained military
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
power given to the executive
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
branch again that's just not an accurate
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
statement it does talk about the threat
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
from the Pentagon to reduce funding for
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
the National Guard If This Were to pass
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
ass to me that seems like common sense
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
as a nation we strategically plan to be
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
able to use the guard and Reserve as
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
needed if that ability is taken away
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
from the federal government why would
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
same that's just a
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
reality part of the duty of the National
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
Guard is to protect the
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
country the reason the Federal
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
government gives the state so much money
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
to run the National Guard is so they can
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
necessary it was also claimed that the
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
opposition only comes from the Pentagon
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire State veterans
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
advisory committee which I have sat
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
on and in case you're not familiar the S
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
has its membership from every veteran
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
HB 229 was unanimously opposed at every
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
up the author did meet with the the
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire esac because he wanted to give
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
a clearer picture of the bill from real
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
veterans that have experienced the
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
horrors of
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
War I don't know who we thought he was
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
talking to in that
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
room there are veterans from many eras
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
war and do not want to compromise
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
National Security with this bill matter
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
of fact there's hundreds of years of
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
military experience in that room whenin
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
meets they are well aware of the horrors
 
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
of war and I just want to let everyone
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
know that every member of the New
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire esac whether whether they
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
served in combat or not is a real
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
veterans I have per personally
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
participated in two Wars and fully
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
understand the horrors of it during my
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
last deployment to the streets of
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
Fallujah I lost 11 Marine Brothers in
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
combat as well see over 100 earn the
 
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
combat as well see over 100 earn the
Purple

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
Heart

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
war is
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
horrible but sending our servicemen
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
overseas keeps us from seeing that in
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
our own
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
land I ask the committee to itl HB
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
229 this is a state legislature the
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
state legislature should not be doing
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
bills that could compromise our national
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.069 align:start position:0%
bills that could compromise our national
security

00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
fny thank you to the chair I thank you
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
for for uh the former member for being
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
here and speaking today uh I have a
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
couple questions for you my first is who
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
who are we at war with
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
currently currently there is no declared
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
Wars so I follow up um if we were to
 
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
activate the National Guard of New
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go overseas to fight who
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
are we fighting
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
right now we're generally involved in a
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
war on terror so it would probably be a
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
terrorist another followup please um
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
could you could you
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
name uh
 
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.309 align:start position:0%
name uh
a

00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%

00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:42.190 align:start position:0%
a

legally
 
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
legally
recognized

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
state that America is currently at war
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
with now representative just by the very
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:57:56.029 --> 00:57:56.039 align:start position:0%
terrorist they do not necessarily have a
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
state that does not mean they cannot
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
attack us does not mean they cannot kill
 
00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:02.549 align:start position:0%
attack us does not mean they cannot kill
American

00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
American
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
citizens you talk to people right now
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
with what's going on in Israel and
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you Hamas is not
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
Palestine but it most definitely
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
is terrorists do not necessarily need a
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
state to act from we found out that in
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
2001 when we had a group working out of
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan it was not their state but
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
they attacked our
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
country other
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
questions uh if not I have a quick one
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh that I want to throw out there and I
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
think it's it's relevant uh you
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned 1991 uh you and I were in the
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
same Battalion at that time we went to
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh the Middle East went to uh Saudi
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
Arabia and Kuwait now at that time in
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
the fall of 1990 into 1991 the US Senate
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
had an authorization of force uh measure
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
that was asked for that would allow
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
President Bush 41 to use force in the
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
Middle East passed narrowly in the
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
Senate we were in uniform watching that
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
closely now later on President Bush said
 
00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:11.039 align:start position:0%
having put all the having deployed all
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
the resources to the Middle East uh he
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
was going to use them anyway regardless
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
of whether or not the Senate approved
 
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:21.039 align:start position:0%
the measure authorizing
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
force uh so my question to you is what
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on what President Bush
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
supposedly said that he would go ahead
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
and use Force anyway even in the absence
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
authorization personally I would have
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
thought that would have been wrong but
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of compromising going on
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
there was compromises on the budget that
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
year and stuff that he worked
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
on to make it pass I will say that is
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
one issue that we face right now with
 
00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:54.789 align:start position:0%
one issue that we face right now with
the

00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
ship in Washington
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
DC could we get a declaration of war
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
when we declared war in World War Two I
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
denters I don't believe that's even
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
possible and as was mentioned earlier
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
hyperarid within the parties we do not
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
have a house speaker right right now and
 
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
if something happened right now we would
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
not be able to declare war the first
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
thing we would have to do is select a
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
speaker so and I also add and this is a
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
big thing we haven't declared war since
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
1941 well one of the outcomes of World
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
War II was the establishment of the UN
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
whether you like the UN or not that is
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
supposedly the governing body of the
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
world and supposed to help control
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
conflicts a lot lot of what we do now is
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
UN anytime we have to do when we were in
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
the Gulf in
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
91 President Bush had to go to the UN
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
and get authorization there too so
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's several folds that the use of
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
through thank you uh uh one more
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
question that we need to roll on here go
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
ahead represent Manion thank you Mr
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh the one thing I would just mention is
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh during the um the Katrina hurricane
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
there was 1836 fatalities do you think
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
that more of those people would be alive
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
if more of the Guard Louisiana National
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
Guard were in state to help I absolutely
 
01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:40.630 align:start position:0%
Guard were in state to help I absolutely
do

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
not there that was a disaster that
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
nobody could predict the size of it they
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
had already activated and pre-positioned
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
the guard that they thought they were
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
going going to
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
need so so whether they were there or
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
not first you got to figure the
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
destruction that happened in the
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
Louisiana in the surrounding
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
area many of the Guardsmen couldn't
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
respond because there weren't passable
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
roads or anything else the complete
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
power grid and communication grid was
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
wiped out so no I don't and I think the
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
response in 96 hours having over 30,000
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
troops there proves that no probably no
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
lives would have been saved if that
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
Louisiana uh representative
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
Mett question I
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
have is there a
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
situation where you would in fact
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
support HB
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.910 align:start position:0%
support HB
229

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
229
 
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
229
any

01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
conflict in the current state and how we
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
have set up our strategic planning and
 
01:03:02.119 --> 01:03:03.190 align:start position:0%
have set up our strategic planning and
our

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
military I would
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
not again the National Guard in the
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
reserve is a critical part and direct
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
partner with our active duty forces
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
anytime there's a conflict and I will
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
say even you got a major training
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
exercise you're probably going to find
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
some active you're going to have to find
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
active some reserve and probably some
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen that are participating even in
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
a large scale exercise because so much
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
of the support units have been placed
 
01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:37.549 align:start position:0%
of the support units have been placed
into

01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
those this has been a strategy that's
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
supposedly saving us money that's come
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
down because people wanted the defense
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
budget cut because the Soviet Union was
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
no longer a threat so the reality is our
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
National Guard in reserve are part of of
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
needed other questions saying none thank
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
you representative R out or former
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative honorable Leon R out all
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
the way from Lancaster I do have some
 
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.190 align:start position:0%
the way from Lancaster I do have some
printed

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
you y okay we need to roll on here uh I
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
think we've largely accomplished the
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the working session uh I know
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors asked numerous questions
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
uh that have been very helpful to those
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
of us in the committee to get some um uh
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
some more Fidelity in terms of some of
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
the aspects of this um I do want to
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
recognize some of the uh briefly
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
recognize some of the other
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives I have a lot of folks
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
who want to weigh in um the clock is
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
ticking um we'll see how quickly the uh
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
the elected officials can get through
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
what they have asked to to State and
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
then we will go from there uh and again
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking for something new
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
something that the committee you think
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
needs to hear that has not come up
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
either in in on February 3rd which was a
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
hearing uh or earlier today so that said
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh moving right along and hopefully
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly representative from
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
Northfield representative is here uh
 
01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
Northfield representative is here uh
representative

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman thank you
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'll make this
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
extremely quick I'm just concerned that
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
our National Guard is being used as
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
Pawns in a larger geopolitical game
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
played by the mega corporations Ron loed
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
Martin and just brief history lesson
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
here in the early 1800s the French
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
Foreign Legion was created in 1831 in
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
1835 they were essentially given to the
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
queen of Spain to fight during a
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
secession battle and for 3 years they
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
sent 4,000 troops and after three years
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
only 500 returned and I'm just concerned
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
that we've essentially sold our
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors into conscription for Wars in
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
places that the average American can't
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
find and I think that's extremely
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous problematic and only going to
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
increase as long as we believe that we
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
the latest and greatest equipment to
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
keep our National Guard able to do what
 
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
we have floods in New Hampshire do we
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
need these tankers I mean I understand
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
the concept but it's not really part of
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
the defense of New Hampshire I think we
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
honestly I think we have more of a
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
problem with Canada going full
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
totalitarian right now than anything
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
else but that's just my quick uh outake
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
on this and thank you any
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you and we do need
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
to keep this to new information uh uh
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
not that we're not interested in your
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
opinion we technical information that
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
addresses the language of the measure
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
that we're going to shortly take up an
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
executive session representative
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
question chair uh sure represent thank
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I appreciate um could we
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
set a high time of maybe quarter 12 to
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
go into executive session and I don't
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
want to C cut off any of our current for
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh current former members of the house
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
that want to speak to us today but we
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
did have a public session and I know
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
some members may have commitments you
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
know thinking we're going to have a
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
10:30 EXA where they may have to leave
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
and not be able to vote on this bill so
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
that's something I would ask of the
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you represent I agree uh and
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good uh time to uh uh
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
wrap things up so we can go to the
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
scheduled executive session so we will
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
move right along uh until no later than
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
11:45 so those of you who are wishing to
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
weigh in again as I've said several
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
times uh we're looking for new
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
information this is not a hearing this
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a working session uh I'd like to
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
represent uh recognize a representative
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
from straford District 19 repres penzer
 
01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
is thank you chair I was not able to
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
testify before so and I'm not going to
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
do that now you wanted new information
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
so my information is my personal
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
experience so in 91 I uh that's when I
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school it's also
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
when I signed in for the Army Reserves
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
um I was actually going to college so in
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and because of that I did
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
a split option which they don't even
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
really offer anymore so I went to basic
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
training in the summer of 91 came back
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then I went um to Virginia for my
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
MOS training and I missed going to
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
Operation Desert Storm by two weeks I
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
was a water dog 77 whiskey and of course
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
their uh water treatment Specialists of
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
course are in the desert so I think that
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
everything that I've heard here is the
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful testimony but we're talking
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
about rules and laws the foundational
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
law in our country it's what we took as
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
representatives to the US and to the New
 
01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
representatives to the US and to the New
Hampshire

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution is specifically article one
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
section 8 that's what this bill is I I
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't it's really not rocket science for
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
me and if we can't have have that you
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
know constitutional checks and balances
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
then what do we have especially in New
 
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with what happened during coid
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
for example I spoke to many national
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen I have a lot of friends that
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
are in um that actually lost their jobs
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
because they were deployed here to
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
answer phones and to in inject our
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
people at you know at a racetrack if it
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
was it was pretty crazy during that time
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
so and if you don't have any sort of
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
checks and balances on our executive
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
branch here that's a problem and then
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
going back to what was said about not
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
having a speaker the president has
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
Authority in Congress we all know that
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
just like the the governor here has that
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
can call us all into session and we can
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
make decisions if there's a declaration
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
of war or something like that that needs
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
to happen so I just wanted that as a
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
reminder but we have have to prevent all
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
of these hasty decisions so requiring a
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
declaration of war imposes a deliberate
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
and formal process that necessitates
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
careful consideration and debate so of
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
course it prevents a lot of different
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
things in deoiling military the clarity
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
of purpose is another one a declaration
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
of war provides a clear statement of the
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
nation's intent and purpose in
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
committing military forces this Clarity
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
is important of course for the military
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
and the public but I think the most
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
important thing here is the public
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
accountability the decision to go to war
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
or deploy National Guards should be
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
transparent and an accountable process
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
requiring a declaration of war ensures
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
that elected officials are on the record
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the public can hold them accountable
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
for their decisions and then of course
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
everything about doing with casualty
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
risk but even if you look at our
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
International um law and Norms the
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
International Community of course around
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
the world generally respects that the
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
principle that military force should be
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
used is a last resort and it has to have
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
just cause so requiring a declaration of
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
war aligns with these
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
principles I think that the sponsors of
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill have been clear and that
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different things that
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
that scap guards but the rules rules are
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
not law our foundational law is our
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I think we have to
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
follow that every single representative
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
here that is going to be voting did that
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
to me it's very easy and I know that I
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't uh I didn't serve in a
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
wartime situation but and and there's a
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
lot of people that did um but we have to
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
take these things you know
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
so especially with what's going on right
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
now it's imminent that we uh that we act
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that it's uh that we have to
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
do that thank
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman Moffett
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
ranking member shirtliff um I did not
 
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
get to
 
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
testify at the February her third
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
hearing I am a member of Criminal
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
Justice and as a result have to be there
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
most of the time I do just want to read
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
to you a quote by President Truman that
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
was given during his farewell address
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
that I think has to relate to this a
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
piece of a
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
quote this conjunction of an immense
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
military establishment and a large arms
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
industry is the new American Experience
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
the total influence economic political
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
and even spiritual is felt in every city
 
01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
every state house every Office of the
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
federal government we recognize the
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
imperative need for this development yet
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
we must must not fail to comprehend its
 
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.350 align:start position:0%
we must must not fail to comprehend its
grave

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
grave
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
implications our toil resources and
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
livelihood are all involved so is the
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
very structure of our society in the
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
councils of government we must guard
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
against the acquisition of unwarranted
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
influence whether sought or unsought by
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
the military industrial complex the
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
potential for the disastrous rise of
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
misplaced power exists and will persist
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
what President Truman was warning about
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
in that quote is what we are dealing
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
with here here today 80s something years
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the country which stood for what we
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
thought was the moral right righteous
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
side in World War II what I think is the
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
moral righteous side galvanizing the
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
world and stopping the fascist Menace
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
but since then have used that moral
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
stature to destroy the world for
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
economic political and social means and
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of men and women here
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
people behind me who love this country
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
and want to serve it to their full
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
extent but cannot do that if their
 
01:14:37.629 --> 01:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
service is being manipulated by the
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
people at the top of our military
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
establishment used for purposes that are
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
not the protection of the United States
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
of America and our homeland uh the
 
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
forever war that George Orwell talked
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
about in 1984 War the one that never
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
ended the one that always had a
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
justification the one that was always
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
important I think we're going through
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
that right now I think the so-called war
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
on terror the wars in Vietnam and Korea
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
talk to the people there's a few of them
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
here in this room chairman Moffett I
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
know you served I know there are a
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
number of people who have served just
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
talk to the other Representatives that
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
have spent time in Vietnam that were
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
there on the ground spent time in Iraq
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
they will tell you that that was a war
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
and they will tell you how brutal how
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
Bloody it was and how impactful that was
 
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
on their life and when we're talking
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
about retention when we're talking about
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
the admissions in our military service
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
being at an all-time low I think we can
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
address that and resolve that by
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
restoring trust in our governmental
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
institutions by saying to them you will
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
not be deployed unless there is a
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
thoughtful deliberative process voted on
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
by 435 members of the United States
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
Congress that actually declares war
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
against an enemy and we have not done
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
that in the last 82 years I think we in
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire have a chance
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
to push the Congress to get that done
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
and to implement a rule which protects
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
our National Guard members we can't do
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
it for the Air Force we can't do it for
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
the military broadly but we can do it
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
for the National Garden I think it's a
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
worthwhile thing for us to do here so I
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time chairman Moffet
 
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
I have to get to a study committee that
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%

in the
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
house uh while she's approaching the
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
witness stand that's not the right word
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
the witness stand but
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I do need to point out it came up
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
earlier a declar last declaration of war

was not in 1941 it was in 1942 against
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
Bulgaria interestingly if you didn't
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%

topics that I'd like to address um this
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
morning first I will Define terms which
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
are critical in understanding the bill
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
language second I will highlight my
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as written and
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
third I I would like to offer a
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
potential solution so first topic is
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
definitions National Guard versus State
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
militia National Guard is a state-based
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
mil military force that becomes part of
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
the reserve components of the unit
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
United States Army and the United States
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
Air Force when activated for federal
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
missions as such the National Guard
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
units are under the Dual control of
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
state government and federal government
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
state militia or most commonly known as
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
State Defense Forces sdfs are distinct
 
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
from the reserves and the National Guard
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
in that they serve no federal function
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
in times of both War and Peace sdfs
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
remain solely under the control and
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
command of their Governors allowing the
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
governors to deploy them easily and
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
readily in the event of a natural or
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
man-made disaster today 23 States and
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
territories have organized militias New
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%

States operations that would fall under
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
title 10 status for example would be
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%

approximately 96 to 98% of the National
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
Guard is federally funded also it's
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
notable to understand that equipment
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
acquired by the National Guard is
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
considered dual use for both wartime use
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
as well as domestic operations use this
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
equipment is used for training
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
operations which could be under title 10
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
or title 32 status and lastly State

device designed primarily for military
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
service intended for use in such service
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
it may also include such
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
instrumentalities not designed primarily
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
for military service if its use subjects
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the individual to a hazard particular to
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
the military service so the second topic
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
of um that I'd like to address is my
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as written I
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the bill which
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the National Guard from
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
being deployed into active combat which
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
is a title 10 Duty without a formal
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
declaration of war by the United States
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
Congress unfortunately in my opinion
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
after analyzing the bill language I feel
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the bill misses the mark As written
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
and it does more than the stated intent
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
this would result in negative
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
consequences unintended consequences if
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the current bill were to become law so
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
that said I will not address concerns
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
related to the potential loss of federal
 
01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.270 align:start position:0%
related to the potential loss of federal
funding

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to focus my my comments
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
here with regards to um the function of
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
the National
 
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.470 align:start position:0%
the National
Guard

01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
Guard
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
um so what are these negative unintended
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
consequences well first as written if
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
you would refer to to the bill print out
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
that um under Section Roman numeral 2
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
line 11 that's problematic active duty
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
combat is defined as one of the
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
following three functions so line 14
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
it's defined as partici participation in
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
an armed conflict second lines 15- 16
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's also defined as performance of a
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous service relating to an armed
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
conflict in a foreign State and thirdly
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
on line 17 it's defined as performance
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
of a Duty through an instrumentality of
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
War as such any of these three functions
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
can then be sub substituted for the term
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
on line 21 active duty combat but of
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
particular concern is line 17 and I'll
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
repeat it performance of a Duty through
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
an instrumentality of War this would
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
result in the prohibition of a number of
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
core functions of the National Guard so
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
concern number two as written this bill
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the National Guard State
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
partnership program under 10us code 321
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
training with friendly foreign countries
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
authorizes the state partnership program
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
which is primarily training in nature
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard has a
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
state partnership program with both El
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
Salvador established in 2000 and Cabo
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
Verde which is uh Atlantic Islands off
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
the coast of Africa and that was
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
established in
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
2021 therefore the New Hampshire
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
National Guard State partnership program
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
would in fact in my opinion be
 
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
negatively affected by this bill
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
specifically by line 17 since training
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
involves the performance of Duty through
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
an instrumentality of War concern number
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
three as written this bill would
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit humanitarian Civic assistance
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
under 10 US code 401 humanitary and
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
Civic assistance provided in conjunction
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
with military operations again line 17
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
the performance of a Duty through an
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of War for example
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
Airlift Transportation loog Logistics
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
Force protection search and rescue which
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
utilizes for example helicopters heavy
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
equipment and water purification systems
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
for these same reasons stated previously
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
this function would also be affected by
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bill concern number four as written
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 13 of the bill are also
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
Pro problematic referring to the term
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
Federal military service federal service
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
fall under both title 10 federally cont
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
controlled and federally funded as well
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
as title 32 which is State controlled
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
and federally funded in this context the
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
section it's unclear with regards to
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
control if this intent has to do with
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
control funding or both control and
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
funding concern number five section
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four of the bill text
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through 28 is of concern it
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
reads nothing in this section shall
 
01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
limit or prohibit the Governor from
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
consenting to the deployment of any New
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard member on 32
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
USC section 904 so to be clear the
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
provision in section 4 ran numeral four
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill pertains to a single narrow
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
Authority Under title
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
32 specifically this Authority deals
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
exclusively with Homeland defense Duty
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's critical to understand that title
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
32 provides for many additional
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
authorities un which would undou
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly be negatively affected if
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become law as written
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
for example all training under 32s U us
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
code chapter 5 training entitled
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
training that would be impacted and
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
lastly my concern number six is any
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
function including training in the state
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
partnership program that occurs outside
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
of the contiguous United States Yukon it
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
must be in title 10 which is federally
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
controlled and federally funded to be
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
clear all national Guardsmen whether
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's the army or the Air National Guard
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
on duty outside of the United States
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
must be entitle 10 status any such
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
functions would be negatively impacted
 
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to become law not all
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
training occurs State Side some training
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
exercises occur in foreign countries
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
outside of the contiguous United States
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
for example training could occur in
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
Canada or England the instrumental
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore the instrumentality of War
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
definition section three on line 17
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
combined with the use on line 21 for
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
active duty combat that would
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
essentially prohibit the National Guard
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
from any title 10 Duty unless there was
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
a declaration of war this again it
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
includes training in a foreign country
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
including the National Guard State
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
partnership program because any of such
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
that such Duty it involves Vehicles
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
vessels defi devices or equipment all by
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
definition that are instrumentalities of
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
War which brings me to my third topic
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the solution and
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
um may I speak to to my solution which
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
is an amendment is that it's very brief
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
because it's very succinct I understand
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that may come forth
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
shortly at executive session um but uh
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
while you're there uh and because you're
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
involved with the amendment if you could
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
speak quickly to that sure thank you it
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
will be quick so um based on my analysis
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill over the summer I I clearly
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
saw that there were some issues and
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as written so I
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
reached out to the prime sponsor
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor understood my
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
concerns um and he supported my my
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
solution which is a very simple
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so um what I had OS go
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
ahead and and draft that and just to
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate s my concern is a significant
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
number of functions and missions
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
performed by the guard involves the use
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
of um vessels Vehicles devices or equ
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
equipment designated primarily for
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
military service they're all
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
instrumentalities of War therefore my
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment simply strikes line 17 which
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
which solves a lot of a lot of problems
 
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.550 align:start position:0%
which solves a lot of a lot of problems
and

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
um finally to be clear to reiterate once
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
again that if this bill were to move
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
forward with that that that line 17 it
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
would prohibit most National Guard
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
deployments to be able to conduct
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
training outside the contiguous United
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
States as well as as to provide training
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
and assistance um to foreign military
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
units abroad through the National Guard
 
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
State partnership program and to be
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
clear neither of these two are combat
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
functions so um with that I will
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and I'd also like
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
to say that um I did bring a a subject
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
matter expert um here with me today I'm
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions with
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
regards to my testimony but if you're
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
looking for a more comprehensive and
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
in-depth um answer to your questions I
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
would recommend that those questions be
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
deferred to Colonel power who is a
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
retired United States Air Force officer
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
and um he also served 28 years of his
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
time in the Massachusetts National

such that I know how to be brief and
 
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
concise uh good morning my name is uh
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
Eric power I'm from Brookline and I
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
served in the Air Force for 30 years I'm
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
a 30-year veteran 28 of those years my
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
first 28 years were in the Air National
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
Guard so I've been a Guardsman um I
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
served as a civil engineering officer
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
then a squadron commander then a
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
director of logistics and Engineering
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
for the state on the joint staff the
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
National Guard joint staff in
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I also spent a lot of
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
time at National Guard Bureau and at the
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
Pentagon doing joint planning so I'm
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
very familiar with with the statuses of
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
everyone and how important that is um I
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
also you know did planning for many
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
exercises and over a dozen actual
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
natural disaster emergencies so I know
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
this the that statuses are important and
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud to have been have been a
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
citizen Airman because the National
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
Guard is special it there are two of the
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
seven components in the United States
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
military that are guard it's the Army
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
guard and the and the uh air
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
guard the reason that the guard is
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
special is because it has dual mission
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
of supporting the governor locally in
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
the state or territory as well as um
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing the operational Mission federally
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
and there has to be a balance there and
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
currently there is um the balance is
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
actually sort of a gentleman's gentle
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
woman's agreement on how many national
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen can be deployed out of of a
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
state and that's not really a good place
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
to be so I think this is this makes a
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
lot of sense this bill so I'm in favor
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill um I think it would help
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
bring the discussion forward help change
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
the way that we do business in declaring
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
war and um would also help balance the
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
important role that the National Guard
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
has in its state Mission as well as its
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Mission you know we've seen a
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
lot of uh more recent disasters and you
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
know people people think it's climate
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
change or whatever it is but the
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
National Guard has been used more and
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
more and more in the past 10 15 years
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
especially during my
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
career um so I would like to also state
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
that I think the bill as written does
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to have that line 17 deleted
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
because um you know when you're talking
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
about instrumentalities of War that's
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
basically military equipment and there's
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
no real distinction Guardsmen use that
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
all the time whether they're do in the
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
United States or they're doing it
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
overseas so I think deleting that would
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually Remedy and make this a great
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
Bill and would be good for the National
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
Guard um in New Hampshire and I think it
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
would start the conversation so that we
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
would have the National Guard being able
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
to fulfill its dual Mission role in a
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
more responsible
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
manner um saying that I I'll take any
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your great insights uh
 
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:52.750 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your great insights uh
uh

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh quickly representative hgan
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
um yes a very quick one we uh hopefully
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's quick in Lin's uh you mro um
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
leading line 17 but line 15- 16 a is
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
participation in an armed conflict and
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's no specification of where that
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
armed conflict is certainly we could at
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
least in theory have an armed conflict
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
USA but then they make a point
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifying second performance of a haard
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous service related to an armed
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
conflict in a foreign state so what's
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
participation and uh performing
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
performance of a hazardous surface
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
related to an armed conflict sure I can
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
mention that that comes back a lot the
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
Army ends to do that and my Army
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues the soldiers and the Army
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
guard um front line folks are usually
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
what they consider the participants in
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
the armed conflict then you have combat
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
support which are the folks that are
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
behind the lines supporting it but not
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
out of Harm's Way and so that's what
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's saying so you're not going to go to
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
the front line and you're not going to
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
be directly supporting the front lines
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
with without a declaration of war and I
 
01:35:57.870 --> 01:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a very good bill to
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
pass okay thank you uh Colonel and thank
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
you for your service okay we have about
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
seven minutes what I want to do at this
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
time is uh go through from the top of
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the deck here and uh if you've already
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
spoken in February i' would ask that you
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
not speak again uh again this is not a
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
hearing is a courtesy to those of you
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
who are here I want to give you as many
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
as we can a chance to say a few words
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
when we heard that this in February 3rd
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
there were many veterans who were very
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
very serious and I'll never forget
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
looking at their faces and how important
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was to them that's why we
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
retained it that's why we're spending
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
time on it today and that's why uh we we
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
will come to an exact session at noon
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
time and vote on it um Derek po Derek is
 
01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.310 align:start position:0%
time and vote on it um Derek po Derek is
Derek

01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
here you said you had some written
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh is that something that
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
you've already passed out
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay if you could uh share your written
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be great that'll
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
give us time to uh review that uh as we
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
go into exec session and while you're
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
doing that I'm going to look to uh Colin
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
Colin is Colin here uh Colin would you
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
like to take up to a
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
new Colin and Derek thank you my name is
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
Colin Mitchell I'll be brief and
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
succinct all my opinions and uh
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
statements I'm going to make are my own
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
and no one else's I have to say this
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
because I'm currently serving in your
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
National Guard these are my own opinions
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
not the guards I've been a Staff
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Sergeant in the Army National Guard for
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
over 12 years now mostly in Illinois
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
many um approximately one New Hampshire
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
I served on both flood duties in
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
Illinois as well as Co response and
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion earlier that
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
um having more soldiers would not have
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
reduced loss of life or other instances
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
during um flood incidents and I can tell
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
you from doing flood Duty that every
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
single soldier is necessary and when
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
you're standing on a levy that has the
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
illino river risen to the top of it and
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
the other side is someone's home and
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
you're sandbagging to make sure that
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
that Levy doesn't disintegrate and
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
destroy their livelihood uh every single
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
pack is necessary um on the co response
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
we had far fewer people than we would
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
have liked to have um I was doing
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
analytics work we were deciding how to
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
get the most doses of vaccine into the
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
few number of freezers that we had
 
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
available that could reduce the VAC the
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
temperature to the very low uh
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
temperature needed for the vaccines to
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
be viable uh I wish I had more people
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
with me doing that um I have two degrees
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
in Applied Mathematics and that was
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
still very very difficult so the idea
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
that more people being in their home
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
state doing work to defend and support
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
that home state the idea that that isn't
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
a necessity um I don't think is
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
factually accurate uh thank you it's all
 
01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
factually accurate uh thank you it's all
I

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%

representative uh Nolan poer I'll make
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
this very very short uh I did not make
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
it here in February so uh I'm a little
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
disappointed in myself but I'm here now
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't always agree with Democrats
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
or Republicans and don't even get me
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
started with with
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
Libertarians but uh what I I think we
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
can agree on here is that all of you
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
sitting around here at this table are
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%

thank you for your uh forbearance uh
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh representative Granger
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
straford District 2 uh thank you Mr
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
chair um so I want to talk a little bit
 
01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
about uh one of the uh former co- I
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if he's still considered a
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor or not um he he left the
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
honorable Joshua agitant was one of the
 
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of the bill I whether he's
 
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
still or not I don't know but um the one
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
of the last things he did in the state
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
house was probably the best thing I've
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
ever seen anyone do from the well which
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
is he went down and during unanimous
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
consent he listed and had a moment of
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
silence where he just listed every New
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident who died in Iraq
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's 23 people all right and you can
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
say with you know we need the National
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
Guard for National Security we need this
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
that and the other thing but can anybody
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
seriously say with a straight face that
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
the Iraq War was about National Security
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the Iraq that New Hampshire was
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
served by those guys dying in Iraq that
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
we actually needed those guys to
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
sacrifice their lives for the protection
 
01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was the Iraq War
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire or America you
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
can think you can solve that for
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
yourself you can think about it for
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
yourself but he he left some people out
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
because and this is not this isn't his
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
fault at all um because there is no way
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
to keep track of all of uh the actual
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
casualties of Iraq the fatalities from
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
Iraq because a lot of them died by
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
Suicide and uh we have some uh suicide
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
statistics but we don't have all of them
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
um we can't be sure for sure and and so
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
we there's a lot of theories about why
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
veterans often commit suicide but there
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
is the elephant in the room the one that
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh we should probably pay attention to
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
and that is the pointlessness and the
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
insipid nature of the wars
 
01:42:09.149 --> 01:42:09.159 align:start position:0%
themselves if you go to a place and you
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a reason to be there for instance
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
you're defending your Homeland you're
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
protecting the people you love you're uh
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
freeing slaves you're uh beating out the
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
oppressor and say and you know releasing
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
yoke of pharaoh whatever the case may be
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
you have a reason to be there and even
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
though you may see horrible things you
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
might see some awful disastrous things
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
you might engage in some atrocities
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
yourself you'll know that you at least
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
had a purpose and you can actually sort
 
01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:36.350 align:start position:0%
had a purpose and you can actually sort
those

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
out I went to Kuwait in
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
2012 what was the purpose of me being in
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
Kuwait in
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
2012 the waren the Gulf War ended in
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
1991 and this goes for every single War
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
so you talk about now the Afghanistan
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
war right so you're thinking about the
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan war had a really good point
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning we were attacked seems
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
like a justification but then you
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
realize that we were we had a war
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
against al- Qaeda that turned into a war
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
against the Taliban and the Taliban
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
weren't even involved in the 911
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
terrorist attacks whatsoever and then
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
you realize that oh wait we're trying to
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
teach afghanis to be Americans somehow
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we have National Guardsmen in
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan trying to teach afghanis to
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
be Americans they're on the opposite
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
side of the planet they don't even know
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
is they they don't they've never heard
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they they know us
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
because that's where the bombs are
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
coming from all right and and this is
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
every war all right and it weighs on
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
your soul and that's probably why the
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
veteran suicide rate is so ridiculous
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
all right so so imagine now I had a
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
pretty easy time in my deployment
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
because I was only in Kuwait uh no one's
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
Cho in Kuwait but what if you were the
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
guy that was in was the guy helping the
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
Saudi pilot bomb the yeni water
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
treatment facility all right and what if
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
you now Pilots are generally pretty
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
smart they can probably do their own
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
research and you look it up and you say
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
gee why am I in Yemen helping the Saudis
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
bomb a water treatment facility in Yemen
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
and then you look it up and you see Oh
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
look The reason I'm in Yemen helping the
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
Saudis is because the Saudis are mad at
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
America because America made a deal with
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
Iran that isn't exactly a very good
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
reason to be doing what you're doing and
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
once you see the consequences of that
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that hurts that's a weight on your
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
soul all right over 100,000 kids women
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
and innocent people died from chalera
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
kalala is an awful way to go it's an
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
awful way to go none of those people
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
were a threat to New Hampshire none of
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
those people were a threat to America
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
they hadn't even they had no idea they
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't point out America on a map this
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
is the poorest country in the Middle
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
East Al Qaeda wasn't there there was the
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
houthis you you guys can think for
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
yourself do you know who the houth are
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
do you know why we're bombing the houth
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
if so there's a lot of you know there's
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
been a lot of claims that we already
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
have a method for reigning in the
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
executive we can go through Congress
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
through the authorization for the use of
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
military force if this is the result we
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
get from the amount of control that we
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
have over the Executive then what good
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
is it you know yes I'm glad that we have
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
aumf and Congress can pull the pur
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
strings but they don't so we need more
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
oversight on where we're sending our
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
sending our kids and as New Hampshire we
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
we can't say we can't send active duty
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
overseas that's not our prerogative
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's not our wheelhouse
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
we can definitely tell them that we
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
can't send our National Guard kids
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
overseas we need them here thank

Dairy
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
um I agreed to uh the amendment because
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
without the amendment it restricts the
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
National Guard I'd also like to address
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that this
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%

war but we served
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%

1145

02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.709 --> 02:01:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
son get
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.119 --> 02:01:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
went

02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
went
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's and uh
 
02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's and uh
they

02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
will okay folks it being
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
1201 by that clock uh let's get to uh
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
the reason that we're here was is to
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
exact this measure and uh and surely
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
take a vote on it one way or the other
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is those of you
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
whove been here know that there was a
 
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
talk of an amendment uh representative
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%

believe here um and I think it it's
 
02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
believe here um and I think it it's
some

02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
oh and I just think it's something you
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
may enhance the
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh is I heard there's a second

power uh the amendment was submitted by
 
02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:36.750 align:start position:0%
power uh the amendment was submitted by
represent

02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
pman um we at this time uh if you would
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
please speak to that propos proposed
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman so um
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copy of the the
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you compare that to the
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill language the amendment simply
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
deletes line 17 which um states in the
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
definition of active duty combat it
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
eliminates the the provision um for the
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
performance of a Duty through an
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of war and as I had
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
explained um
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
previously why this is important is that
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
a significant number of functions and
 
02:04:21.629 --> 02:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
missions performed by the National Guard
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
in fact involves the use of
 
02:04:26.549 --> 02:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
instrumentalities of War which are
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
defined as Vehicles vessels devices or
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
equipment designated primar primarily
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
for military
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
service and um as I stated previously
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
that by in including this language this
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill um would prohibit most National
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
Guard deployments in summary as I had
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
stated previously to conduct training
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
outside of the contiguous United States
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the ability to provide
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
training and assistance to foreign
 
02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
training and assistance to foreign
military

02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
military
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
units abroad that's out of this country
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
through the National Guard State
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
partnership program and also as I'd like
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
to further note that these two functions
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
they're not combat um functions in in
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
nature and uh lastly I will add that um
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral 2 of the bill line
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
11 the participation in an armed
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
conflict um in in L that's line 14 and
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
on line
 
02:05:44.549 --> 02:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
15 the performance of a hazardous
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
service related to an armed conflict in
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
a foreign State I I believe that's
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uphold the intent of this
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
bill and as I said the um re retention
 
02:05:59.069 --> 02:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
of that line 17 performance of a Duty
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
through an instrumentality a war that
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
goes beyond the intent of the bill and
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
actually breaks things um so that that
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's my explanation of of the
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and I um I would hope that um
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment would be accepted
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair will you take
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions for me uh sure
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh just just to be clear for me and for
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of this representative uh in
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
the original measure what what only
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
thing that's being deleted is that line
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
17 which states performance of a Duty
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
War so um with regards to Roman numeral
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill which Encompass
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
17 the way that OS drafted the amendment
 
02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
is we're just
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
replacing those lines with what's in the
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
amend Amendment which essentially simply
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
deletes line 17 of the original bill
 
02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
which again removes this performance of
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
a Duty through an instrument ity of War
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
because that goes back to this
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
definition of active duty combat right
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's defined as one of the three um
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
functions and then if you go down in
 
02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:32.990 align:start position:0%
functions and then if you go down in
section

02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
three active duty combat is referenced
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral three of the bill and
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we're just
 
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
eliminating performance of Duty through
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
an instrumentality
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.149 align:start position:0%
an instrumentality
War

02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
clear the bill remains exactly the same
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
we're just striking line 17 in the
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
original bill that's
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
it okay representative if if we were to
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment which hasn't it's
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
been approved by OS it has an amending
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
number 2276
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
H uh I'm reading the amendment and I'm
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
seeing where it'll replace the language
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the original bill I think that's
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
fairly clear the the piece of this that
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
is not quite clear to me is that the
 
02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
amendment says nothing about line
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
17 because on line one of the amendment
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
it says that the section two is replaced
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
with the following it's just the way
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
that they they draft it we're we're
 
02:08:45.549 --> 02:08:45.559 align:start position:0%
replacing that part and we're just we're
 
02:08:45.559 --> 02:08:47.390 align:start position:0%
replacing that part and we're just we're
not

02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.589 align:start position:0%
not
including

02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
we we're replacing section two with
 
02:08:52.159 --> 02:08:54.990 align:start position:0%
we we're replacing section two with
section

02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
two right if you look Mr chairman it
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
deletes line 17 which is number three
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah performance of a Duty through an
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
instrum I see I see okay so the by
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
replacing uh section two the way that
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment does that uh that answers
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
my question okay so that this amendment
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
replaces 17 and there's no need for any
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
other okay
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
correct it's too it's just the way that
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
they drafted it okay I got it does
 
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any is that clear to
 
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
everyone else represent Rollins thank
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman does that include uh B

else have any is there anything else on
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment rep Manion so uh from my
 
02:10:43.950 --> 02:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
understanding the instrumentality of
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
Wars like defined especially by the
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense and the IRS as
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
something as like uh how to find
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
somebody as a part of combat Duty like
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
so if you were to be uh uh allowed
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hazard pay or combat pay that is also
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
the same language that they use it
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover just driving in a Jeep in
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
like Mexico you would have to be uh you
 
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
know participating in some type of armed
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
conflict even if you're uh not in the
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
area it would be like uh midair
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
refueling uh over like outside of a
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
combat zone but supplying a combat zone
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
or convoys of trucks supplying a combat
 
02:11:16.109 --> 02:11:16.119 align:start position:0%
zone but not setting foot inside you
 
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
would qualify as combat pay that's my
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
take on this but uh if this amendment
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know is makes everybody in the
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
committee happy then uh that's
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
fine anything else on the amendment
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%

paratrooper getting hazardous duty duty
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
pay for being a paratrooper whether he's
 
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%

02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
from a nav man anything else
 
02:11:49.199 --> 02:11:52.990 align:start position:0%
from a nav man anything else
representative

02:11:52.990 --> 02:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
shiff how can I follow that um thank you
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mr chairman I want to thank
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
the member from Brook line for bringing
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment in and I also want to
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank the colonel for being with her
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
today and for his testimony I'm going to
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment not that I'm
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to what it's trying to do but I
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
would rather see this amendment
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
Incorporated a new bill and to have it
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
maybe go into rules for a late filing
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
and bring it back as a complete Bill and
 
02:12:22.549 --> 02:12:22.559 align:start position:0%
let us Ved it all at one time I know the
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
CH had a little bit of confusion at
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
first as did I when I fir on my first
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
blush I think this does improve the bill
 
02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
but I'd rather see it as a total package
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we could take up at one time and be
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
able to vet it this is an important bill
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
we can see by the number of people that
 
02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
have turned out today and we appreciate
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
them being here but and again this is no
 
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
reflection on the member is just what I
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
like to see as part of one Bill thank
 
02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any anything
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
else the last comment that that I will
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
make is that uh the representative just
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
said that he thought that the new
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
language did improve the bill my sense
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that the members uh see this as an
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
improvement uh W if this amendment were
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
to pass then we would take the bill up
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
as amended if the amendment does not
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
pass we'll take the original Bill up and
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
we will vote on that uh if this does
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
improve if this does improve the
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
language and I uh am inclined to support
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
it I rule of thumb being that uh even if
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
you don't like the the the measure if a
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment improves it uh we want to see
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
the best measure go forward if it goes
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
forward that is my take on it anything
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
else before we uh have the
 
02:13:43.709 --> 02:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
clerk run the role uh saying no other
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
the comments uh Madam clerk if you would
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I I just wanted to make a a quick
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
statement before we go into the voting
 
02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
um active voting session um even with
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'm a little concerned
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
over some of the things in the bills uh
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
or in this bill and I just want to make
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
sure that we that if anything did happen
 
02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
it like it we I could talk um
 
02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
constitutionally speaking I'm concerned
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
about this bill um because technically
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the that we received from um Warren
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
Perry uh Deputy adjutant General had
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
note or had noted that um the National
 
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
Guard is called to active duty under the
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of title 10 of the US code
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
and it says in times of War of National
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
Emergency declared by Congress or when
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise authorized by law um and he
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
pointed that out to us um all and then
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
on top of that I worry that if we
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
require a declaration of war it would
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
seriously hinder our Armed Forces
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
ability to swiftly respond to a national
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
emergency and it could limit our support
 
02:14:56.189 --> 02:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
of the Armed
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
Forces um for for anybody else who's
 
02:15:02.669 --> 02:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
overseas and I don't want to do that and
 
02:15:04.750 --> 02:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
it could potentially seriously affect
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
the federal funding to our state um
 
02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
those are really big concerns that I
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
have here um even if the bill is amended
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
um however I also really want to speak
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
to all of the veterans and citizens
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
who reached out to me on this specific
 
02:15:24.669 --> 02:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
bill um I heard you and in late August I
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
had to take an emergency trip back to
 
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
Kansas to attend my Uncle Mike's funeral
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh he was a marine and he was enlisted
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
quite young he had to get his father to
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
sign off on him being enlisted and he
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
served as a tunnel rat um so he was over
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
there he was a purle heart Purple Heart
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
veteran um
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
and the the lack of support that he felt
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
it really stretched deep and he had many
 
02:15:53.229 --> 02:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
medical issues throughout his the rest
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
of his life because of it um his
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
personal story weighed on me a lot when
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
I was considering all of this bill
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
um so I want all of you to know who
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to me thank you and I heard
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
you um and I understand but I still
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't overrule those other concerns that
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
I have here um additionally to those
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
that submitted this Bill thank you I
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
majored in
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
Psychology but my school focused on
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
psychological research and one of our
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
ideas was that sometimes with research
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
you need to chip away or present
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
something that gets thought moving and
 
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
discussion happening and it lays a
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
foundation for other research to be
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
built off of and it's slow progress but
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
over time eventually those hypotheses
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
are tested and proven or disproven and I
 
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
feel like this bill to those who choose
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
to listen can provide some of that
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
foundational work um understanding that
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and all over the country
 
02:16:59.709 --> 02:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
veterans have a higher suicide rate than
 
02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
average than the average citizen
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
population I ask those here to recognize
 
02:17:07.629 --> 02:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
and understand that this bill directly
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
identifies one specific area where our
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
veterans feel they are lacking that
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
support not only did many veterans who
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
contact me identify this but they wanted
 
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
to me to support this bill to prevent
 
02:17:23.709 --> 02:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
others feeling from what what they had
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
felt and this is absolutely crucial to
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
listening to the psychology behind all
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
of this so anybody who has the authority
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to do so or can talk to people in a
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
federal level in any way shape or form I
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
think we need to be bringing up and
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
bringing attention to this bill and this
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
particular interest that uh that has
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
been generated here um I believe we
 
02:17:49.309 --> 02:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
would be SM smart to listen and to pay
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
attention and to lean into this and act
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
proactively to support and better serve
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
those who have served our country if
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%

02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
somebody say
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%

02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
resident of shortliffe motion on the

floor in front of the committee is itl
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
and expedient to legislate uh
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative would you care to speak
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
to your motion just briefly because
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've been here a while and I think
 
02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's patience first of all let me
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
say that the prime sponsor of this bill
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
is not just a friend I consider him a
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
good friend and I've been honored to
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
serve as co-sponsors of other bills that
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
he's done and uh I've got tremendous
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
respect for him and all the uh
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill as the member said this bill needs
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit of work and I think this
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that we heard about could help
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
it but I wonder if there are other parts
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill that we don't understand
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
and what I would recommend to my good
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
friend from dairy is if the bill should
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh not passed today with a
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation of OTP to go back to the
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
rules committee and mention that this
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
information that came up at this hearing
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
and asked for a late filing to file the
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
bill again so that the bill could be
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
considered in as totality with the
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and I would just say Mr
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I would ask the committee to
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
please vote for the itl but the
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to my friend from Gary is
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
to bring it back through rules with the
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
improvements thank you representative uh

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:28.910 align:start position:0%
it's also uh being recorded uh uh is
being

02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%

02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%

02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
our infantry units in New Hampshire have
 
02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
already been doing they've done at least
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
three that I can think of off top of my
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
head um and considering the the you know
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
current events happening in the world
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
where where're potentially saying that
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
our state is okay with with the federal
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
government without any type of of act
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
from Congress to tell you know Governor
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
sununu or whoever in the future that we
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
will send troops to Israel we that we
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we're going to send troops to
 
02:25:06.429 --> 02:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
Ukraine and then it becomes our problem
 
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
we we weren't even involved the problem
 
02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
is is that we're involving too much of
 
02:25:14.429 --> 02:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
ourselves in in you know um excuse me
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the happenings in foreign states and
 
02:25:19.630 --> 02:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
it's the bill is specific in line 15 the
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
performance of a hazardous service
 
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
relating to an armed conflict in a
 
02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
foreign State no one is talking about
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening here we're only talking
 
02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
about being sent into foreign countries
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
to to to subsequently subsidize foreign
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
States you know through their you know U
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
through their government through their
 
02:25:39.389 --> 02:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
military and through our training we are
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
still providing Our Lives to them not
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
for our own interests but for theirs and
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm not what
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
what the mission
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
is uh people that serve in the guard are
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
to serve the state of New Hampshire not
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
to serve foreign interests or corporate
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
interests it's only for armed conflict
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that this bill is
 
02:26:01.469 --> 02:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
talking about thank
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh rep
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manion uh again thank you
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh so I oppose the itl motion uh for
 
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
several reasons I'm going to outline uh
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
Congress cannot uh hand over its
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
constitutionally delegated power to
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
another brand of government that would
 
02:26:20.269 --> 02:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
be like scotus writing legislation pus
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
confirming their judge appointments the
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
process requires a Constitutional
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment ratified by the states contact
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
our representation has not worked for
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
over 20 years the very activists that
 
02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
came up with defend the guard tried that
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
route for decades Congress has failed US
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
senator ran Paul's latest vote to repeal
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
the 2001 aumf garnered 10 votes in the
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
Senate the legislation uh legislative
 
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
branch is not willing to De clawback
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
their war war makinging Authority from
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
the executive because it Shields them
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
from the consequences that they'd have
 
02:26:52.269 --> 02:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
to live with for actually voting for war
 
02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
the 2001 aumf is still active with no
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
clearly defined targets duration theater
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
of operation or Victory conditions
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
military campaigns have been launched in
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
at least 22 countries largely classified
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's used to justify coups across
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
regions some of which involved working
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
with Isis and al-Qaeda in theaters such
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
as Libya and Syria so the argument that
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're fighting terrorism with these aumf
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
we we fight with the terrorists uh in
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
Syria speaking of Syria uh the the
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
Louisiana National Guard came under
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
rocket attacks from IR Iranian backed
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
militants this past spring and what are
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
they these troops doing in Syria they're
 
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
guarding private oil
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
wells so we go we talk about funding and
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
losing potential uh funding here uh
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Congress handles funding uh it's the
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
word we keep hearing the fiscal not says
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
that it puts the money at risk this
 
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
would be political suicide for Shaheen
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
papis kustard to vote against the
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
National Guard uh congressman gsar and
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
Congressman Massie have gone on record
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
to say that there are no active
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussions at all in Congress to
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
withhold the money for any National
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
Guard unit it would be absolute
 
02:28:00.319 --> 02:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
Guard unit it would be absolute
political

02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
political
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
suicide uh during the during my
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
presentation to esvac I requested the
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
Bill's opposition be removed uh but not
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily to change to support I just
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
wanted the opposition remove it became
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
rapidly apparent that the department of
 
02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
military Affairs has an oversized
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
influence on an organization whose
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
mission is to support veterans nothing
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
can support veterans more than
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
preventing service members from being
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
abused by the United States Department
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
of Defense and coming home broken after
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the presentation several non-voting
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
members approached me to say they
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
supported the bill this has been the
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
same reaction I've received at vfw's
 
02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
American Legions and even via email and
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
phone calls after I published my New
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Journal article and again in
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
my local paper uh the bill is outright
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
adored by just about every person who
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
hears about it many of whom are veterans
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's a massive disconnect between the
 
02:28:47.950 --> 02:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
voting members of esvac and the veterans
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
they are charged with representing it is
 
02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
my belief that the department of
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and Department of
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
Veteran Services being combined as a
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and high on high on
 
02:28:58.030 --> 02:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
my list of priorities to in 2025 to
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
remedy when I run again thankfully this
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh Bill's Journey brought this to my
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
attention this is a bill whose time has
 
02:29:05.950 --> 02:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
come over the decades several states
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
have realized that waiting for Congress
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing is a Fool's errand
 
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at things like civil asset
 
02:29:13.269 --> 02:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is being overturned at the
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
state level uh States uh legalizing abis
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
for medical use is something the federal
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
government prohibits the states need to
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
claw back their Authority here uh there
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
states legalized gay marriage for
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
decades decades before scotus made a
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
ruling on it various Sanctuary policies
 
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh immigration or second
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
amendment these are also pushed by the
 
02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
states asserting their 10th Amendment
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
rights uh defend the guard fills a
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
similar Gap to say enough is enough we
 
02:29:42.429 --> 02:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
tried we're tired of the pentagon's
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
budget saving measure of exploiting
 
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
state militias if the Department of
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
Defense can't recruit enough active duty
 
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
army or can't afford to house and train
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
them these are symptoms of the exact
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
problem defend the guard is trying to
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
remedy we are stretched too thin in too
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
many regions fighting Wars that are
 
02:29:59.469 --> 02:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
Undeclared our men or women are coming
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
home sometimes in boxes other times
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
physically and emotionally scarred for
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
life all all the while states are left
 
02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
without their citizen should soldiers
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
during emergencies and for what can
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room say we were better
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
off our actions in Afghanistan 20 years
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
of Bloodshed bloodshed the country back
 
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
to the Taliban now better equipped with
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
abandoned gear what about Iraq a war
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
based on a lie where much of our gift uh
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
gifted equipment and even Iraqi soldiers
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
we trained ended up joining
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
Isis so once again fighting terrorism
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
but creating more terrorism instituting
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
a caliphate worse than Saddam ever was
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing regime change around the entire
 
02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
region from Libya where we assisted Isis
 
02:30:42.269 --> 02:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
and Al-Qaeda and overthrowing Gaddafi
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
left the area in chaos a literal slave
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
trade is active in the streets of this
 
02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
country country now what about Syria
 
02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
another regime change conflict
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
predicated on a lie where we once again
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
train representative we're getting into
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
02:30:58.110 --> 02:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
specific uh uh National policy
 
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
deployment issues and and and we we need
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
to exec this and and if you could focus
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the merits of the specific language
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'll skip right here
 
02:31:09.389 --> 02:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's a nebulous description of our
 
02:31:10.750 --> 02:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
guard uh missions where we say we're
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
supporting our allies and protecting us
 
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
interests it sounds Noble at face value
 
02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
except sometimes our allies have been
 
02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
Isis and Al-Qaeda uh and sometimes we
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
demo our high Mars battalions as if
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
allies so so Congress is happy with the
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
status quo the executive regardless of
 
02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
party party in power is happy with the
 
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
status quo just like with term or age
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
limits or balanced budget amendment or
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting stock trades or with holding
 
02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
Congressional pay until they pass a
 
02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
budget nothing will change no matter how
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
much we beg Congress it's time for the
 
02:31:49.269 --> 02:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
states to act it times for us to act so
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
I ask we vote against itl and make
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
another motion thank you thank you
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative anyone
 
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
else I would just like to make a
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
statement that I disagree with this bill
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
um and a big part of it is you know it's
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
not just political
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
suicide but it's because it actually
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
affects people it weighs on my soul to
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
cut funding for veterans which you know
 
02:32:18.269 --> 02:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
helps with PTS D and they're really
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work on that now and you
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
know compared to in the past you know in
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
the past 20 years they've really come a
 
02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
long way and they've got a ways to go
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
but it it weighs on my soul to do that
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we can save a lot of lives that way
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
so and then on top of that the money I
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
could lead this see this bill as causing
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
Congress to become even more jury Mander
 
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
um you know and corporations puming more
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
money into elections than they already
 
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
do so I think that's a huge part of this
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
inherent problem as well and this bill
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
does not address that so I will be
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
voting against it but I just wanted to
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
make that statement and thanks to all
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
the veterans out there and the ones who
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't support this bill as well so thank
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
else uh
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
repr uh we'll give you this courtesy
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're not a a normal a regular member
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
of this committee but uh we do try we
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
want to give you a chance to speak if
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
you if you so desire oh thank you um
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to be um encourage well
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
if it if this passes um it would and
 
02:33:36.429 --> 02:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
other states to encourage con Congress
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
to formerly declare war and well
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
certainly I certainly wouldn't trust
 
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
this particular Congress which is
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
totally dysfunctional as we probably
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
everybody in both sides I agree but
 
02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
sentive I think the nature of the
 
02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
current Congress is not part of the
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
issue here with what we're talking about
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
in executing the language of this bill
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you could finish your remarks
 
02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
please yes but declaring war is all
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of legal and economic effects and
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily agree that our
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
economy would even be on a war we
 
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
probably would have to step up just like
 
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
the 1940s I think that's um a very
 
02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing to be declaring war
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
because had all kinds of uh impact on
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
civil liberties and other domestic
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
things so it's probably not as not that
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
the way we' been doing is great but
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
probably be even worse if we had uh
 
02:34:21.389 --> 02:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
something if this was something like
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
this was in in effect in our state in
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
the other states so thanks thank you
 
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative seeing no other hands uh
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes repres I'll be quick on this one I
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
guess uh my concern is still outstanding
 
02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
in that I do worry that not being able
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
to send our uh National Guard to assist
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
our troops who are current currently
 
02:34:49.389 --> 02:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
serving overseas if there was an
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
emergency like how would we be able to
 
02:34:58.110 --> 02:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.269 --> 02:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
first thank you sentive before we run
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
the uh Madam clerk runs the uh role my
 
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
final comment um I want to thank
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
everybody who's here uh I want to thank
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsors for the huge amount of time
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
that they and others have spent on this
 
02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important uh issue
 
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we're shining a light on and having
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
an important discussion uh on which
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
we're about to vote I honestly have been
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
un undecided on it uh we retained it in
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
large part because of how seriously we
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
took the many veterans who came in on
 
02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
February 3rd and passionately uh asked
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
us to cons consider this and we spent a
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
lot of time today we made extra time to
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh fully allow folks to answer our
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions and address this I will say
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
that uh we're hearing different things
 
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to esvac State veterans
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
advisory Council uh ranion uh I think
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
fairly points out that there are many
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
members of the subsidiary organizations
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
who don't who do support the bill I have
 
02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
to say that I the intent of uh esvac as
 
02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
an advisory council is to help us out
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
with with with uh legislation such as
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
this and where do they stand on it and
 
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
knowing that many individuals support
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
the bill the fact that esvac itself
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
apparently unanimously uh opposes the
 
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
bill has to wait has to Bear some way at
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
