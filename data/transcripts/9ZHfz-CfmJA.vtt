00:00:07.799 --> 00:01:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay I think everyone has the handouts
 
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
so Chris take it away good morning for
 
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
the record Chris Shay from the LBA um
 
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
before you you received three documents
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the one that I handed to you was the
 
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue Focus document um commissioner
 
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
step provided the Dr presentation and
 
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
then Jennifer 4 provided a um blog
 
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
document that Phil slon has prepared
 
00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
revenu so my purpose real quick here was
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
just to bring the committee's focus on
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
onto the revenue Focus um remind you
 
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
that there is a document that is out
 
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
there that you should have access to on
 
00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
a regular basis um if you were to look
 
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
at the first page you can see for the
 
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
current month which would have been the
 
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
April Revenue um you exceeded your plan
 
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
by 38
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars you know on the right
 
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
hand side of the column gives you little
 
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
Snippets as to why you may have exceeded
 
00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
or not exceeded a revenue plan for a
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
particular tax revenue or Revenue
 
00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
and then if you flip to the third page
 
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
there's a big table it says general
 
00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
education funds that gives you the
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
year-to date on your Revenue Collections
 
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
and it splits it by the general fund and
 
00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and you can go
 
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
through that and see what revenues are
 
00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 align:start position:0%
up and what revenues are down and in
 
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
which buckets they are up and down if
 
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
you go to the bottom row where it says
 
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.270 align:start position:0%
you go to the bottom row where it says
total

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
receipts you're going to see for the
 
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
$68.84 for the education trust fund
 
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're $26.4 million below
 
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 align:start position:0%
plan and then when you combine the two
 
00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
your general education trust fund
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
revenues are only 142 .4 million ahead
 
00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.990 align:start position:0%
revenues are only 142 .4 million ahead
of

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
plan so I just wanted to start with that
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
with you give the document to you when
 
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
Lindsay's done with the presentation
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
from Dr I'll come back up and talk a
 
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more about some of the
 
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
individual ndra taxes as well as give
 
00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
you kind of a snapshot of what our
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
office is anticipating for um the banum
 
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of some of the expenditures and
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
um unanticipated Appropriations that
 
00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 align:start position:0%
have have come forward um just so you
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
can hear about that because you sure
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear it from your peers
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know as you have bills with
 
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that you want to
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
pass so that's all I have for right
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
now thank you any questions before we
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
hear from yes represent fellows thank
 
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
you I have a question about um the
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
business profits and The Business
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and I'll let Dr answer
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
any of those questions it'll probably be
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
part of the presentation that they're
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to thank
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
you w welcome thank you good morning Mr
 
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
record Lindsay stpp I'm the commissioner
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Revenue and with me
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
is Lauren ulvan she's our senior
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
financial analyst we're going to kind of
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
tag team this
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
presentation it should look somewhat
 
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
similar um if you remember what our
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
presentation looked like during the
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
revenue estimating process um but we'll
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
go through Slide by slide tax by tax if
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's okay with the chair we'll pause at
 
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
the end of each tax for any questions
 
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 align:start position:0%
and then move through the taxes that way
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
you so what you have on page one
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
is the various scenarios that we run
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to determine where we
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
believe the current fiscal year revenues
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
will end up as you may remember our
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimating process typically um
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
takes current year Revenue we estimate
 
00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
where it will end the current fiscal
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
year and then we Pro um estimate a
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
growth rate going into the next year so
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
this is what we determine or this is
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
what we call our base year so in this
 
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
case it's fiscal year 24
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
we are 10 months through the year we
 
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
have two months to go so we know most of
 
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
the revenues at this point so we're
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
feeling pretty confident in our
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
estimates but we do still run these
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we look at what plan
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
revenue is if we were to apply the
 
00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
percent compared to plan for the
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
remaining two months of the year where
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
would we end up if we were to compare
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year to the prior fiscal
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
year and assume that same percentage is
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to continue for the rest of the
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
year year and then we say okay what if
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
actual revenues year-to date what if we
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
meet plan for the remainder of the year
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
or what if we say actual revenues year
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
to date and the last two months of the
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
year are exactly the same as last year
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
so those are the scenarios that we run
 
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
again this point in the year 10 months
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
through they kind of start coming
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
together um but we did go through and we
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
did pick the scenario that we believe to
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
be um the most accurate for the last two
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
months and so we'll cover that for each
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
tax type then for each tax Ty we'll talk
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
about what we think the growth rate will
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
25 okay so on page two just as a
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
reminder these are your fiscal year 25
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference Surplus
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
statement amounts so these are amounts
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
that were not included in the revenue
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
estimates that this committee and the
 
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
senate committee worked on these are
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
adjustments that needed to be made to
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
those estimates for legislation that was
 
00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
pending at the time that you were doing
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
your Revenue estimates so these are
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
included um as a surplus statement item
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
and then we will make these adjustments
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
as part of the revenue estimates for the
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
most part for fiscal year 25 um the most
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
significant adjustments are between bet
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
and BPT uh for the education trust fund
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
and the general fund we have a small
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's attributable to
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
Dr audit positions that need to be added
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
in and then the appeal uh the repeal
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me of the interest and dividends
 
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
excuse me of the interest and dividends
tax

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to Dive Right In
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
on page three with the heavy hitter
 
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:07.909 align:start position:0%
on page three with the heavy hitter
business

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
taxes so historically business taxes
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
have been split roughly 76.4% BPT and
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
23.6% bet so BPT is the largest portion
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
of the business
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
taxes some factors to consider when
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
we're estimating for the remainder of 24
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
and into 25 fiscal year to date we are
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
3.3 million or 3% below plan Senator
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
Rosen Wald and I were just commenting in
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
the hallway we've nailed it we've done
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
pretty well with our business tax
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
estimates and our plan um for those of
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
us that have been doing this for a
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
little while this is the closest we've
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
been to plan I think in quite some time
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we are tracking right on plan with
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
business taxes as a
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
whole fiscal year to date we're about
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
38.3 million or 3.6% below prior year
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
again that was anticipated
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
in the plan and the largest reason for
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is the next bullet which is refunds
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
resulting from the credit carry forward
 
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
limitations that went into effect for
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
tax years 2022 and after so at this
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
point businesses cannot take as a credit
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward more than 500% of
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
their liability they have to have any
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
excess over 500% refunded to them so
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
just under 50% 48.8% of the refunds
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
issued year-to date were related to
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
these credit carry forward caps so about
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
half of our refunds year-to date for
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes are because of this
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
cap taxpayers who kept 500% of their
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
liability as a credit carry forward were
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
20.4% of those refunds so what that
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
means is taxpayers are not just stopping
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
at that 500% they're going beyond that
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
that because this cap will lower to
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
250% in 2 years so we are seeing
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers not just hit the cap and
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
refund over 500 they're going beyond
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they are doing essentially what we
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
wanted them to do which was to reduce
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
the liability that we were carrying on
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
our books as a state um can I just stop
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
you for a second sure um are you
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
informing customers
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm guessing they automatically
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't know there's a 500% cap so how are
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
they being informed and then are they
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
being also told that next year it'll be
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
250% so we do have um technical
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
information releases that go out um
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
where we update taxpayers on legislation
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
the CPA Society tax preparers are very
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
well aware of this change um but when we
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
talked about the the fiscal impact of
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
this change we said well we don't know
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to see it
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily in refunds where they get to
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the year and they have hit
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
that cap or if taxpayers are going to
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
make a proactive active adjustment to
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
their estimate payments and essentially
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
use up some of their credit by lowering
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
their estimates what we've essentially
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
seen is that taxpayers have waited for
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
the return and just taken the money um
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
as a refund as opposed to lowering their
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
um credits on on account thank you I
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
will say that um based on our analysis
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
the majority of the the impact the
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
refund impact as a result of this cap
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
has been felt in fiscal 24 we do not
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate that this same cap um refunds
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
due to hitting this 500% cap will be
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
seen in
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
25 so there the the the impact is kind
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
of now and we've seen it and we're not
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
seeing large um potential refunds
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
sitting out there that we're waiting for
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
them to hit we've seen most of them come
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
through representative
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
Aly yes representative Aly thank you I
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
think that most answers my question but
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh the people taxpayers who had 500% or
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
as uh in in the treasury on are you
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
saying that most of them
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
took on most of that this
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
year yes so they've most of the impact
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
of the 500% cap has already been felt in
 
00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:30.350 align:start position:0%
of the 500% cap has already been felt in
the

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
so what I'm I'm saying is did they go
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
down to 250 or 100% or did they they
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
just go down to
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
500 well so what you'll see in that
 
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
second bullet is
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that you had 20.4 of the refunds that
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
were issued due to the credit carryover
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
cap only went to 500 so the remaining
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
79.6 if my math is Right went more than
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.350 align:start position:0%
79.6 if my math is Right went more than
500

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
500
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
I can't necessarily say to what extent
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
they went to because their liability is
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to change in the next year so I
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily say oh so many went
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
all the way down to the 250 because
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
their liability fluctuates year to year
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
but for the most part they went beyond
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
the 500% and that could be a variety of
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
reasons that could be because they're
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
anticipating the 250 it could be because
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
they are sensing some slow down in the
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
economy and they want their cash in hand
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sitting at Dr it can be
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
reasons is that
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
helpful yes I'm not sure that does that
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
really tells us that they aren't going
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
to come back the 500 ones and hit us
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
with another 200 uh
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
50% they could right they could load up
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
their estim next year and hit us again
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
with the 500 cap but what we've seen is
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
for the most part most taxpayers they've
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
had to go to that 500 and some have gone
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
even beyond that and what's pending out
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
there is not anything that we feel to be
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
larger than what we anticipated for
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
going forward in fiscal
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
25 and just just so members are aware
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
there there is another wild card in this
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that is the um um the chair of the
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
Senate ways and means and I discussed
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
slowing down the um the rate so that
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's not 250 next year it would be 400%
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
from what I understand the Senate has
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
passed that um and therefore um and I
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
think that's that's coming to that
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
should be coming back uh or not coming
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
back coming to the house so that if we
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
if we limit it to 400% that's going to
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
make a difference in these do you know
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
what they attached it to I don't know
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
Senator not to put you on the spot do
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know sorry I don't it's okay thank
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative PL yeah tough
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
question to answer but what could
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
motivate a business not to get every re
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
dollar refund they could get why keep
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
250 or 500% in in the state's hands sure
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
good question um I think there's a few
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
things one if businesses um liability
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
fluctuates year to year and they're
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
concerned that their liability could
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
increase yet next year in order to
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
potentially um not be faced with a large
 
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519 align:start position:0%
tax bill they might keep some money on
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
account um second interest rates are now
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
better um in other accounts but for a
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
while that the interest rate that the
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
state would pay was not a bad place to
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
keep your money um third a lot of our
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
large credit carryovers are from very
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
large multinational organizations and
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is just a small portion of
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
their portfolio of tax liability that
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
they're just not paying as close
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
attention to what they have on account
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
here um their liability are much much
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
larger in in other states so I think
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
those are the three primary reasons
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
makes sense yeah yes represent ores
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if I understand to
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
help alleviate concerns maybe here
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
around this table is that at
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 79% going below the 500
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
level it's taking the pressure off that
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
valve of wow we could get hit with this
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
in the future people are going to dip so
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
we don't you're not concerned about that
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
at all at this point correct right so
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
the in the Years leading up to this
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation we saw the credit carryover
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
that businesses were keeping on the
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
books here in New Hampshire kind of
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
growing at rates that were somewhat
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
concerning um there was also a change
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
recommended by our state Auditors for
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
how we should account for that liability
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
historically we had not accounted for
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that liability on our books a change in
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
opinion of the Auditors um the state
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
decided that that liability now should
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
be reflected so in order to reduce that
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
liability and potential hit to the state
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
we the legislature decided to put this
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
cap in you know my opinion is that
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
highly it's it's highly unlikely that we
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
would have been called upon at one
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
moment to issue all of those credit
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
carry forwards that would be a very
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
extreme circumstance um but it certainly
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
lessens what the state is liable for and
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
lessens the liability that we need to
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
account on our books followup followup
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
so just that of curiosity what is the
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
rate of interest the state has been
 
00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
rate of interest the state has been
paying

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
approximately I'm going to get back to
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
you on that because I don't want to
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
missp well yeah the interest rate was
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
about 1% elsewhere or slightly less or
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
depending so I figured the state must be
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
doing three to five maybe or six if but
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
people were keeping money in there for
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
that reason yeah agree I will get you um
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
we issue a a technical information
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
release every year of the interest that
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
we pay and the interest rate that we
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
char charge they are not the same um we
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
charge more than we pay but it has um
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
the whole history on it so you'll be
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
able to see so we'll make sure the
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee gets thank you uh
 
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.309 align:start position:0%
committee gets thank you uh
representative

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you um so we had um
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
discussed quite a bit what would be the
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
impact of the single sales Factor oh
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah you're jumping ahead would it help
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
or would it hurt yeah and um so far it
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
looks like it's helping there's an
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
increase do you have any sense if that's
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
a trend or that kind of predicts the
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
future or is it too
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
soon I well you can answer that but I'm
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
I'm beginning to wonder whether we
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
should let you finish this first can I
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
ask about the one we were in okay just
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
there or just one thing say that the
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
reason that this was done was that the
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative major had been fighting
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
for years to get us to do something
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
about about this which was ballooning
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it was ballooning before
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
the interest rates went down correct so
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
that can't be the whole reason for this
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
no I I mean I think representative pl's
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
question was somewhat of a hypothetical
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
and these are things that I think
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers consider I don't think there's
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
any one thing whether it be interest
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
rates or that they're not paying
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
attention to their liability in New
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or that they're you know going
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
to potentially face a higher liability
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
next year I'm just providing examples as
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
to why taxpayers don't just take all
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
their money back because I I honestly
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
had the same thought why would you why
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you just take what was yours
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
and only pay exactly what you owe and
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
these are some of the things that we've
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
kind of seen happen over the last few
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
years it was an excellent answer thank
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
you okay we'll let you uh finish up BPT
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
and bet and then we'll see question um
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
so as representative Southworth
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned um another change that we have
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
been following was the impact of the
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
move to single sales Factor so single
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
sales factor is an apportionment
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
methodology and this applies when you
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
have businesses that operate within
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
multiple States how did they determine
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
what portion of their income is a
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
tributable to each state so we have
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
moved to single sales factors so a
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
business is just going to look at their
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
sales to New Hampshire previously we had
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
three factors we looked at property
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
payroll and sales legislature made the
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
determination that the only factor that
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
we were going to use going forward at
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
this point was single sales Factor when
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature was making this change
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
we provided numerous analyses and what
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
we saw is that the impact of single
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
sales Factor could fluctuate year toe so
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
some years it was a positive for the
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
state some years it was a negative for
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
the state so what we've
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
seen um for tax year 2022 is that it's
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
been about a 15 $50 million positive to
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of Trends or what we
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
see going forward don't have a specific
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
answer to that other than what we've
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
seen historically is that the analysis
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
showed that it could fluctuate out of
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
the three factors property payroll and
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
sales sales is the most volatile right
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
it it is harder to get rid of or acquire
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
property in a state typically payroll
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
that is something you know human beings
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
are you either have the employees or you
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't you could have a large layoff or a
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
large hiring spree but that tends to
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
payroll tends to be a bit more um stable
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
sales are the most volatile um you can
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
have as we saw a global pandemic that
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
for some companies drastically reduced
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
their sales and for other companies they
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
saw significant increases in sales so I
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what we're going to see in
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
the future but I just know that sales
 
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.510 align:start position:0%
the future but I just know that sales
are

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
volatile um other factors that we
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
considered as part of these estimates as
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
we've talked about many times the
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
stimulus package ages from the federal
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
government put a fair amount of a bare
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money into the economy um that
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
money is in there it is doing what it is
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
doing but there's you know the majority
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
of those stimulus packages have ended
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
for the most
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
part unemployment rates and inflation
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
two things that I think everybody is
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
watching at this point um there's a
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
forecasted GDP growth in 24 of
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
2.5% and 1.9 in 25 that's compared to
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
2.5% in 23 so I think we're seeing some
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
stabilization and then maybe a bit of a
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
slight decline in
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
GDP unemployment um is forecasted to
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
rise nationally to 4% at the end of 24
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
up from 3.8% now obviously New Hampshire
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
is trending even lower than that
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
3% and then inflation this forecast
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of forecasts out there
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
we just picked one to show this forecast
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
um has 3.3% at the end of 24 which is
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
down about a half a percent from the
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
3.8% currently so what does all of this
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
mean we are estimating for fiscal year
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
24 that we would end the year at 1
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
b243 million which is down just 3% from
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
plan and this is essentially assuming
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we remain at that minus. 3% that we
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
are at today through May and June the
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
vast majority of Revenue that will come
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
in in the last two months will be in
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
estimates in June um and we've seen
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
estimates in um April cooling off a
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
little bit um and so we're kind of in
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that we will just kind of say
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
status quo as compared to plan for the
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
remainder of the
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
Year talking about fiscal year
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
25 um we assumed that that business
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
taxes would remain flat there does not
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
seem to be a lot of change um going on
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
in the economy at this point the economy
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
just seems fairly stable it doesn't seem
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
to be growing there is there's threats
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
of you know things may be turning down
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
slightly but most of the indicators that
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is just for pretty stable
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
revenues going into 25 the slight
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
increase that you'll see from the 1 b243
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
million to the 1
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
b246 million that $3 million difference
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
is a surplus statement item for the Dr
 
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
is a surplus statement item for the Dr
auditors

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
um director the question I have is yes
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before Bank of
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
America used the
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
sord in one of their uh stagflation
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
okay that wasn't the first s word that
 
00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
okay that wasn't the first s word that
came

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
anyway well if you remember
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
Jimmy um
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
was that taken into your consideration
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
they were indic they they were asking I
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
believe in their update on um Revenue
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
estimates um for for Bank of America why
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
no one else was concerned about that at
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
that time was that taken into the
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
consideration regarding revenues and
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
revenue uh um
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
projections Bank of America statement
 
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.950 align:start position:0%
projections Bank of America statement
not

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
specifically but I I think in General
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
when we're saying kind of a 0% growth
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
rate going from 24 to
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
25 that's kind of maybe the fact that
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're feeling kind of the same way that
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's been an effort to reduce the the
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
inflation it has come down it is not
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
maybe continued to decline there's been
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
talks about lowering interest rates that
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
didn't happen at the last Federal
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
Reserve meeting so I think our feeling
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
is that it's everything's feeling like
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
status quo at the moment so whether you
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
want to use stagflation for that term or
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
CH so the question then becomes is this
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
a feeling or are there objective
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
standards that have occurred events that
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
have occurred that would lend Credence
 
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.669 align:start position:0%
have occurred that would lend Credence
to

00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
the apprehension that I think is
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
widespread both I'd say we kind of look
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
at a lot of you know reports we take
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
into account these GDP forecasts the
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
inflation forecasts the unemployment
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
forecast and then it kind of just
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
becomes a general feeling so it's not as
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
prescribed or mathematical of take you
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
know these specific inputs in a some
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
sort of formula and output a growth rate
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
it is more let's look at these inputs
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then how are we feeling so it's a
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah depends on the Day represent PL I
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
want to go through a thought
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
exercise the federal government's
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
running about a $2 trillion deficit
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
every year year after year after year uh
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
so it's essentially printing money uh to
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
cover that and I'm trying to think
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
through the impact of that to the state
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh and one uh
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
businesses because of inflation may very
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
well raise their prices which may
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
increase our Revenue resulting but our
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
costs will go up too as we reflect
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
inflation through what we pay uh for
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
various services and for labor so uh
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
what is the net impact of all that in
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
your view positive or negative or who
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
knows I think the answer is who knows
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and I think and we've talked about this
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
before that New
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax base and economy is fair
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
fairly diverse we have retail we have
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hospitality we have tourism we have
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing we have a variet we have
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
Healthcare we have a variety of
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
Industries and
 
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.310 align:start position:0%
Industries and
so

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
as increased cost or increased prices
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
impact various businesses in different
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
ways for some it's good for some it may
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
be not as good or bad but we have a
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
diverse business base so I think we can
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
kind of weather various storms if you
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
will fairly well and we've seen this in
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
the past that when we do have a
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
recession or a downturn New Hampshire
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
tends to not fall as far but we don't
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
recover as quickly because the places
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
the states that fall far and recover
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
quickly are when you have a lot of your
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue concentrated in certain
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
industries so I think because of our
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
diverse tax base and industries in the
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
state and diverse taxpayers
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
for some the the money that's been
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
infused into the economy is a good thing
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
and increased prices are a good thing
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
because they hit the bottom line for
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
other companies those increase prices
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
might be for their cost of goods sold
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be negatively
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
impacted on the bottom line so I think
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
it just comes down to the diversity of
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
the businesses allow us to kind of
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
weather the storm a little bit easier
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering an impossible
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
question succinctly and
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
nicely thank you anybody else questions
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
before we move
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
on okay I just wanted to cover quickly
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's question to
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:43.389 align:start position:0%
 
eloquently

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
um splitting business taxes between BPT
 
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.710 align:start position:0%
um splitting business taxes between BPT
and

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
bet is one of the harder things that we
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
do because taxpayers pay to the
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
department typically bet bet and BPT
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
together and we need to kind of we need
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
to then split them apart because while
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
they are separate taxes they are very
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
much interchangeable the bet is a one
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
for one credit against the BPT so they
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
are totally interdependent if you will
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
on each other so what you'll be what you
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
are likely seeing in the revenue Focus
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
which I think may have sparked your
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
question is how bet seems to be
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
performing under plan while BPT is over
 
00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:28.909 align:start position:0%
performing under plan while BPT is over
plan

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that is due to how we allocate the
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
revenue so because taxpayers will just
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
make fill out an estimate form and folks
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
like representative Aly who have been
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
around for a while have remembered us
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
attempting to get taxpayers to fill out
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
a specific BPT amount and a specific bet
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
amount and there was quite a bit of
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
uproar amongst the business Community
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
when we ask them to do that because the
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
taxes are so interrelated it's very hard
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
to do so businesses will fill out
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes one or the other they'll say
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
here's a $100 and they'll put it on the
 
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.830 align:start position:0%
here's a $100 and they'll put it on the
BET

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
line up
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
until July 1 we were taking that amount
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the business put on that form and
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
attributing all that to bet so if they
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
said $100 to bet we would put that all
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
to bet and then when their final return
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
came in we would allocate the money
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately based on their final
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
return so if it ended up being $50 for
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
bet and $50 for BPT we would do that
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
allocation at the time of the return and
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
move the
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
money what we found is that
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are not very good at
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
estimating their split between bet and
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
BPT and they were just putting it all on
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
the BPT line or on the BET line because
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to pay one tax or the
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
other you're going to pay bet so they
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
were putting all of their money on the
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
BET line and we were having to do all of
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
these reallocations into
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
BPT what we started on July 1 is even if
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
they tell us that that $100 is bet we
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
look at their prior year return and
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
split it based on their prior year
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
return so we are getting much more
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
accurate with our bet and BPT split but
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
we are still having to do these
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
reallocations based on the old
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
methodology of how we were allocating so
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing bet showing
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
below plan is because we are still
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
having to move money out of bet into BPT
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
especially during this time of economic
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
growth in the past few years and
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
businesses having in many cases record
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
profits BPT is just a is going to become
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
a larger portion so at the top of the
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
page you'll see the split is
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
23.6% it's been 6040 in the past so
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're just seeing a move towards BPT
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
plus coupling with how we were
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
allocating the revenue is why we're
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
looking that we're performing under the
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
plan for bet and that will work itself
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
out in the next few fiscal years as our
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
allocation method changes is that
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
terribly confusing or
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
helpful follow just one so when you get
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
to the end of the tax year are they are
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
is does the company square that up so
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
those are really tells you how much was
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
related to personnel and how much was
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
profit yep so when they file their final
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
return we know how much is BET and how
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
much is BPT and we are moving the money
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
within that account and within the
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
revenue accounts to reflect that and so
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing that's exactly
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing that move out of bet
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
and into BPT and that's why we're
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
showing below plan on BET represent
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
Alman two things one on does this mean
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
that the cafer will have much more more
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
accurate numbers in future that's our
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
goal our goal is to get that split more
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
accurate because as you remember we
 
00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:09.070 align:start position:0%
accurate because as you remember we
would

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
historically just split bet and BPT on
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
the most recently completed tax year you
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
kept on doing 4060 I kept 4060 right but
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
now like you're you're seeing we're
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
7525 and so by doing it in this new
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
methodology we will get more accurate so
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
there won't be that delay in the report
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
reping and will'll more timely know how
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
the two taxes are interacting and what
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeing now with that shift to BPT
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and the other one because of the
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
way we defined the taxes when we put
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
them in on the on
 
00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:48.430 align:start position:0%
them in on the on
BPT

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
is only the profit that a particular
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
very large industry gained uh but not on
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
their share of vet so their tax is
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
actually BP bet and BPT correct whereas
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else's tax is just the bet
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
because they didn't qualify or they
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
qualified to give you $100 right on and
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
so it does obscure to some extent how
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
cxed um represented play did you have a
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
question yes is the business profits tax
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
more or less volatile than other taxes
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
we we're
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
populace I don't know
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay I I I'll go back to saying we did a
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
really nice job estimating it and as we
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
get further through the presentation
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see we did not do as nice of a
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
um my my concern is that we're relying
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
heavily on BPT for revenues we I mean we
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
are I view California who uh have bumper
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
years and they're spending money like
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
crazy and then it's not so bumper and
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
then they have to scramble and uh
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
fortunately we've got a more diverse tax
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
base and uh most stability but still is
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
a concern there about volatility correct
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
so you're you're correct that our
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue Pi looks very different than
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
other states Revenue P because of the
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
lack of the income tax and the sales
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
tax but where our Revenue Pi relies more
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
heavily on our business tax our business
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
income tax or business taxes combined we
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
also have a diverse industry diverse set
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
of Industries so if if our Revenue Pi
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
looked the way it did and that the
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
business profits tax say was coming from
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
largely one specific industry we could
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
be facing challenges a volatility within
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
that tax because it's such a large
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the P but where that tax
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
generally is not terribly volatile and
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
you can look and I can send it to you in
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
our annual report you can look at how
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
the business taxes have grown and there
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
are very few years of more of double
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
digit change between the
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
taxes good to know uh represent and then
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
we'll continue with yeah the the other
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
part part of the volatility which is
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
more worrying I think is the small
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that pay for most
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
tax correct if you look at our triangles
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
in our annual report you'll see the tip
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
of that triangle is a few number of
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers although I think we saw during
 
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.390 align:start position:0%
taxpayers although I think we saw during
the

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic that that number stayed the
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
same but the businesses that made up
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
that point of the trial triangle did
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuate because you had some
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that were highly profitable
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and you had other
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that were not and so that tip
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the triangle just kind of swapped out
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
um with some businesses and again I
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
think that goes to the diversity of
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
Industries within our tax
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
base thank you uh representative Malloy
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
did you want to ask quick question
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you Mr chair in in
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
all of this information and and maybe
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
you've answered this before somewhere
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
but we talked about the diversity of our
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
business base do we have a percentage
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
breakdown of that or a pie chart about
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
who what what categories or what I know
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
you don't talk about individual
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and I'm not asking for that
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just talking about the categories of
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
that so that we can I could
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
see what that diversity looks like
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you so in terms of
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
whether we have that at Dr it's a hard
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
question to answer and it's something
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
that I've been looking at since I
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
started at Dr in
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
2010 the hard part for us is that that
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
information would come in on a tax
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
return on what's called a Nace code and
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's a code that the taxpayer fills out
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
that identifies what industry they're in
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
and you can think of large taxpayers who
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
operate in a variety of Industries and
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
they might just put industry that's
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
their largest in their
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio that's the nce code that they
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
use but in New Hampshire the actual
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
activity is from a a different industry
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a smaller subsection think
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
for instance a manufacturer they might
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
manufacture a wide variety of products
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
and the majority of what they
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
manufacture is widgets so they're going
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
to put I'm a widget facturer
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but in New Hampshire
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
they're really a gardener and they're
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know manufacturing plant plants it's
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
not going to totally align so we've
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
tried to use this data and then found it
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
produced results that we didn't feel
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
like were consistent so that's something
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
that we haven't totally been able to
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
tackle and I don't know the best way to
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
do that whether it's coupling with
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
information from either other agencies
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
or other groups and trying to compile it
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
together but it is a a great question
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
and something I would love to do in in
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
my 14 years I haven't figured out how to
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
do it yet followup
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that followup uh
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
so before
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
we put any implied pressure on you to
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
keep going down that road this is a
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
question for the committee is that
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
information that would help us at all in
 
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
information that would help us at all in
Dev

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
Dev
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
developing tax policy as a maybe
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question I address that to
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
the committee that's all I mean I will
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
say maybe one thing that we could do is
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
for the tip of that triangle or say the
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
top 100 businesses
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
or let me start smaller top 25
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
businesses we could do an anal not rely
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
on the nce codes but we could do
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
research and say okay what is what
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
industry would we categorize them for
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
their activity in New
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we could kind of come up
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
with our own analysis and then maybe
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
expand it to the top 50 or the top 100
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't necessarily be taxpayer
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
reported because of that issue that I
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
described and we wouldn't be able to do
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
it for everyone but we could do it for
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
some of of our larger taxpayers and it
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
would get us to a point we could do it
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
to a large enough point that we wouldn't
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
worry about disclosing taxpayer
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
information so maybe that's a a takeaway
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
for us thank you commissioner I
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you thank you
 
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.710 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you thank you
represent

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
ery well you're your last com comment
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
regarding what you could do kind brings
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
up two questions so I'll address that
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
one first 25 the top 25 is nice to know
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
because they produce the large largest
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
chunk but it's the same time we have a
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
diverse income
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to talk about the top
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
we should probably talk about the middle
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
25 and the bottom as to the general
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
category of those so we know somewhere
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
in there and also of that whether the
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
bottom of the
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
pyramid in its totality of of in Revenue
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
generation compared to the top so that
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
you I think for Revenue estimates going
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
forward yeah that would give us a better
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
idea as to the diversity of the the
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
revenue sources sure and a better
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of our economy agreed and
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
going back then to your other question
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the NX code or n codes yep um
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that that even getting the right
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
code is a bit of a problem at times
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
because that IRS is really screwed up um
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
well that's yeah well never mind
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh what you're saying is that a
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
corporation that may be involved in
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
building ships
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
there and uh heavy
 
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.190 align:start position:0%
there and uh heavy
equipment

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
here is going to be classified by
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
whichever one they decide to put down
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
correct correct so it may not be totally
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative of their the actual
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire particularly
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
when they're by uh Manufacturing avionic
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
which doesn't have anything to do with
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
either one right and especially as we
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
get you know that top 25 those very
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
large companies have pretty diverse um
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
you know portfolios of businesses and so
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know it it can be hard to say what
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
of those is the most important here
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
without us doing some our own research
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you just wanted to clarify that
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sure thank you I think we've
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh done a good job with uh BPT and bet
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
and we can move on okay here you go
 
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.309 align:start position:0%
and we can move on okay here you go
Lauren

00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
Lauren
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
I almost forgot we were talking about
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
all of the taxes
 
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.710 align:start position:0%
all of the taxes
today

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
so so uh moving on to the meals and
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
rentals tax so the historical breakdown
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
um for that this particular taxes 80% of
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
it comes from the meals or what I like
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
to call food 177% from the rooms in the
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
hotel industry and 3% from the motor
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle rentals and that 3% is what um
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
is used to figure figure out the
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
education trust fund portion of the
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax so the rooms and
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
meals stay in the general fund and the
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle tax stays in the education trust
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
fund and so when we were looking at our
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
revised plan for this year some of the
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
factors that we looked at was that
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are 5.3 million
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
or 2% ahead of our plan um fiscal year
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
to date we are 7 million or 2.6 ahead of
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
the prior year and when we look at that
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
gross before the the transfers that come
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
off the top of that tax were actually
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
17.4 million ahead of the year or 4.6%
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
growth year-over-year so I just want to
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
make that clear because of the municipal
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
fund transfer and the school building
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
Aid transfer that does make the meals
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax look a little bit more
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
flat than what is actually happening
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
because the meals and um the municipal
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
fund transfer is based on the prior
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
Year's performance in the general fund
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
for the meals and rentals tax and that
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
was also a strong year so the transfer
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the municipal Revenue fund is also a
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
a larger
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
transfer and other things that we were
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
looking at too um is inflation impacting
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of meals rooms and motor
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles um I know throughout this year
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the restaurant industry
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
that a lot of what we're seeing is just
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
just the cost that they have to charge
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
for meals have gone up because the cost
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the goods to prepare meals have gone
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
up so where we may not necessar see more
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
people in restaurants what we're um
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
again the benefit of is the that like a
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
Stak costs maybe 1015 more than it might
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
have a couple of years ago um other
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that were we were also looking at
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
and this is more on um in our Northern
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um counties um that 2023 was the wetest
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
summer on record so if someone had a
 
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lake vacation and they had a
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
re cancellable hotel and they saw the
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
forecast wasn't very good they may not
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
have come up uh as we expected also um
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
we had the warmest winter on record and
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
we had noticed that some of the activity
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
was down because of the lack of snow on
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
some of the mountains and just the
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
amount of work to have something skiable
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
this year um also what we haven't seen
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
yet and that will be in this month's
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
revenues is the impact of the total
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse on the April M&amp;R liability
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
so we we um padded that in and then
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
other things that we took out um is the
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled School building Aid transfer
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the municipal Revenue fund transfer
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
and um that has been occurring since um
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
20 2022 was the first year where we um
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
saw that transfer coming right out of
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax so with that
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
said um our revised estimate um is 2%
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
326.00 but actually it's um we're
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually uh flat over the 2% increase in
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 but consequently once you
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
increase your fiscal year 24 Revenue you
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
have to increase your fiscal year 25
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal fund transfer so when you
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
increase that you end up flat
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
year-over-year on the net revenue for
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
tax and um before I move on to school
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid or the municipal fund
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
transfer are there any questions about
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R represent PL I'm reading a lot of
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence that people are
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
hitting the wall uh that all the
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
stimulus that going into individual
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
pockets is pretty much gone those on
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
food stamps have drawn them down and so
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
the restaurants uh uh the prices are
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
higher which means more Revenue to us
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
but not if there's less traffic and so
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that taken into account in
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
your forecast that there might be less
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
traffic yes it is and um that this would
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
be similar
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
um to like the r tax where the where at
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
this point the higher prices will
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
sustain that flat growth for a little
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
bit until we may see in 26 or 27 um some
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
declines if something doesn't
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change in those Industries
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
and and how consumers choose to spend
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
income yes representative Southworth
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's interesting I have the opposite
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
view of Representative PL which means
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
you were right to just have it in the
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
middle yeah um I tend to um be very
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
positive about the meals part I'm
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
noticing people really that I know have
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
limited income are still loving their
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
lattes and they're still doing the
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
easier takeout um they may not be going
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
to Wentworth by the sea but uh I've been
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
surprised um at the long lines at
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
certain places that I thought might get
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
shorter so I kind of see the opposite
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
end of and in some areas that we saw in
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
the meals this year where um a lot of
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
that growth is in the full service and
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
fast food services and also I I guess
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be a surprise but for
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
some reason it was surprising to me
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
supermarkets because you would think
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
that there isn't a lot of taxable in
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
supermarkets but we do have grocery
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
stores and supermarkets that have a
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
really nice prepared food section or
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
deli section that where they're making
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
sandwiches or they're preparing pizzas
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
and that has just really exploded over
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
the last couple followup
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you um so I think um
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
another thing is I live in the sea Coast
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
which has been booming no matter what uh
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
but I also think like many of our
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
discussions this is an area that's
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
really variable in New Hampshire it just
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
you know like uh property taxes other
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
things we've talked about on this
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
committee I think this really very
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
varies greatly depending on the zip code
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the part of the state and that may
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
also contribute it to it being kind of
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
flat in the end that's correct
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
one other thing I'll just add quickly to
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
Lauren's point about seeing an increase
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
in full service restaurants but also
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
representative South War's point about
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
takeout is that we do have full service
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are offering more
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
takeout since the pandemic but also the
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
variety of services that will come and
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
deliver that take out to your house
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
right you have the door dashes of the
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
world the Uber Eats etc those are still
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
all showing for us in our Revenue as
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
full service because it is coming from a
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
full service restaurant even though it's
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
more akin to a delivery um or a takeout
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
and so I think the ability to to have it
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
delivered to your house also does reduce
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
the cost right the it is typically at
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
least least at least cheaper for me with
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
my children if it just gets delivered to
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
the house and there's not the
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an appetizer a dessert
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know and four lemonades um the the
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill is less when when I utilize those
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
services so I think that is something
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's impact in it as well that we
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily see in our numbers um
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
because it's just still showing from the
 
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.990 align:start position:0%
because it's just still showing from the
full

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
service um I think represent ery and
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you Mr chair uh going back
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
to the question I asked going to be on
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
the meals and
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
rooms um it would be interesting to know
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
what percentage since we're tourist
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
State and tourist income is important uh
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
which is out of state and instate and uh
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
previously said that there's no real way
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
of determining that however if you take
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
a it seems to me that if we could take a
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
look at a a diner and Conway and see how
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
it's going up and down would give some
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
idea as to whether or not there was a
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
tourist coming into that area um because
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
they only have a small population and
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
then they get a large you
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
understand that would be an an
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to to help watch The
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
Tourist trade come in and it's and the
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
other factor is regarding the three
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
sources of meals and rooms or meals uh
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
with the prepared
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
meals is there any way that that we
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
could see how that works uh diners
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
versus full service restaurants versus
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh um uh quick you know drive-thru
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald's to use a term uh versus
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
versus uh hanford's or Market Basket
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
which do make very nice
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
chickens I know I just had a Hanford
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
chicken last night for dinner and one
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
other one other advice make sure you
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
don't feed the kids for two hours before
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
shopping so and this is going to be very
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
interesting very similar to the business
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
taxes how a um how a restaurant or a
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
hotel identifies is
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
self-reported and one thing that I've
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
noticed that I know there's a chain
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant and one location is a full
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
service restaurant and the other one is
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
a fast food but they are identical in
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
concept but they were registered at
 
00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
different times the other thing we also
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
run into and um I know I've discussed
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
this with members of the committee we
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
have uni um we do have unified filing in
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax so if I'm a
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
franchisee and I have 25 locations in
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
the state I can just file my one return
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
to my maybe my most profitable location
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
and all our reporting is going to be
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
based on that one location and that may
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
not be indicative of what's happening in
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
another region in the state so so what
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
so what we can say is as long as they're
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
consistent from year to year if you're
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
consistently fast food and you're
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
consistently in Hillsboro County I can
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
that that's where you file um we can say
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is what's happening but that may
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
not be necessarily true to Hillsboro
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
County if I am a restaurant that has
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
dozens of locations and I'm the one
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
owner uh franchising that yeah I had
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
forgotten about the unified reporting
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for reminding of that but the
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
other question is regarding the
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants Conway versus uh well Hudson
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
um I mean we're going to get traffic
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
from Kingsboro and L only because it's
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
generally cheaper even with gas but
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're not somebody's going to make a
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
two-hour trip to go to Conway they're in
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
the tourist area I think we can do that
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
analysis potentially this coming month
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
we can't go to the town level as as
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
Lauren mentioned but we can do it based
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the county and I think we'll see it
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
in coas County with the eclipse so I
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
think we will see for April Revenue
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's reported in May that Coos County
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
is going to have a disproportionate
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
increase in their revenue compared to
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
the other counties and I think we can do
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
a county analysis by month where you
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
would see the Lakes Region counties
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
potentially seeing an uptick in
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
disproportionate uptick in Revenue
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
during the summer season White Mountains
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
um you know Ski Area Counties in the
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
winter so I think we can can't
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily go to the town level but I
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
think we can look at the counties and
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not we're seeing
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
kind of a tourism impact in those
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
counties in any given month thank you
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
repr represent fellows okay thank you
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say did I understand you
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
correctly to say that that things like
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
door Dash are being charged the room and
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
they pay room and meals tax on that so
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's correct so it's not
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
NE the door Dash but when you place the
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
order to the restaurant the taxable
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
portion of that transaction is being
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
collected so so it's not the door Dash
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the person you're not getting
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're taxing the food you're not
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
taxing the door Dash service is that
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
correct correct so I just wanted to
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
share that every time Market Basket
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
builds a new store they've got that big
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
section now they're providing lots of
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
pre you know pre-made foods that the
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
business and the room and meals tax is
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
going to collect on represent PL oh I'm
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't let you answer was there
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
she's correct okay yeah she's
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
correct may I resent PL what what
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism is there to uh let's see
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
provide some uniformity where the mil
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
room taxes applied and where it isn't
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
example uh I live in an over 55
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
community uh once once a year or twice a
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
year uh a bunch of people in the
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
neighborhood we buy Lobster from uh
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
precook from one or the grocery store
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
one of them applies a tax to the Lobster
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
when it's cooked and another
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so is if you'd like to send
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
us that information
 
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.750 align:start position:0%
us that information
[Laughter]

00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
but the point is what what mechanism
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
does the state have to try to ensure
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
some uniformity citizens like
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
you we we have a Anonymous um Dr T we
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
call it tax fraud but Dr tax fraud um
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
submission form on our website um so if
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
you are finding that tax is not being
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
applied consistently you can submit that
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
to us anonymously or not anonymously um
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
that happened quite a bit when the M&amp;R
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
rate changed when it went down there
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
were still a number of um businesses
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
even though we communicated as well as
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
we could um there were still charging
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
the higher rate and it was literally
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
everyday citizens who looked at the
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
receipt and said hey this looks wrong
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
and sent it to us and we would contact
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
the business and and get everything
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
straightened out so nice what what town
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
do you live in represent
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
elme on yes I read over a month ago now
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
that on the credit card debt in the
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
country had surpassed what it was just
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the Great
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
Recession which was kind of a peak
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
for I think going back as far as we knew
 
00:58:13.559 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
for I think going back as far as we knew
on

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
and I worry uh I am seeing in my own
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
town it's
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
very Irregular at this point but when a
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
house happens to come on the market
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
on sometimes it gets bought up for what
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
is an incredible price and sometimes it
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
sits on the market for five months
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
because the owner thought he could also
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
get the incredible price and he
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't and and they had to wait for
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
him to give up on that on
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
and and the the housing actually the
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax has gone down
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
133% this year so far and that's got to
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that there aren't very
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
many houses left on the market that come
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
on the market that people are willing to
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
give up repes representative what the
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
question should be on meals and rentals
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
yes it's on it's on meals and rentals
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
but it's it's the same uh kind of thing
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
that on we're in I think we're in a
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
transition where a lot of people who
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
have been living based on
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
subsidies are going to credit to keep
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
doing that and are going to hit an wall
 
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
at some
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
point and I don't know how much damage
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
that does to us in meals and rentals in
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
houses and I wish it would happen to
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
houses in a bunch of other things I
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
think that's evidenced by the fact that
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
we're estimating that meals and rentals
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
tax is essentially going to stay flat
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
going into next year so we're coming off
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
of years of growth in M&amp;R and we're kind
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
of forecasting that we for a variety of
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been mentioned that
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
we've kind of are reaching our peak in
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R and that we anticipate it to
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
stabilize a
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
bit okay there's no more questions I'd
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
like to move on to the school building
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
Aid transfer okay so um just to quickly
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
remind everyone what the school building
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
Aid transfer is um this is a monthly
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
transfer that is um 112th of the fiscal
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
year total and and as we're slowly
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
paying off that debt that has come down
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
every year so it's only a few I I think
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was like $600,000 a month when it
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
used to be much greater so for fiscal
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
year 24 it's um
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
$568,000 on on um the 6.8 million in
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled debt and every year that will
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
come down until that is paid off in
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
2030 and I'm not aware of any additional
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
debt that is tied to the meals and
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
rentals tax that's in the forecast for
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
that further um we talked about this
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
earlier the municipal fund transfer and
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
is and that is the distribution to the
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
cities and towns following a popula um
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
following a population
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
formula and and how that is calculated
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
every year that is 30% of the net income
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the most recently completed um fiscal
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
year and that net income is um is the
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues before the school
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
building Aid transfer and before um that
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
Year's um Municipal fund transfer so
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
when we look at our forecast if we
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
increase fiscal year 24 the next year
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
the mun fund transfer will also increase
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
based off of that so if F if um we have
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
a decline in one fiscal year then the
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
munity fund transfer the next year will
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
decline um
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
proportionally and um and what we will
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
so what we are estimating for fiscal so
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
this year this number is set and has
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
been uh distributed to the towns is 13.9
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
million and the way that we determine
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
how much each month to withhold um that
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
is just based on the
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
historical fluctuation in how the tax is
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
collected it's on a seasonal basis so
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
that's why you may see June is much
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
higher than December or January and and
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
how that's
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
determined also uh we are increasing our
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking is the estimate for
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 based on our revised 24
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
forecast we're looking at
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
134.5 million for next year and that of
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
course is always subject to change as we
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
go into that Revenue estimating process
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
um in the next
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
bium are there any questions so on this
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
table um are
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
July 2023 through April is that those
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
actual figures these are actual figures
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
all all the way through to June these
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
are the these are the scheduled
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
transfers so treasury um can confirmed
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
back um either in the late summer early
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
fall that the transfer this year will be
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
13.9 million and what we did um was we
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
distributed how that should come out of
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the out of the general fund based on the
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
seasonality of how we collect the tax so
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
we don't find ourselves in June making
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
$130 million transfer or just something
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit more reasonable in any
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
given month okay thank you so that is
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
set questions on uh School building Aid
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
transfer or Municipal fund transfer
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative Aly thank you I'm a
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
little confused wasn't do we give the
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
money based on what happened the year
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
before every month monthly payments for
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
July of 23 to at are given in July
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
24 so the 13.9 million is the total
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
amount that is based on the total amount
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
of M&amp;R from the prior year so the 13.9
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 is based on fiscal 23
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue we then take that 13.9 and
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
spread it between the months equivalent
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the proportion of Revenue that comes
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
in in that month so it's not an exact
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
July to July it's a total fiscal year to
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
a total fiscal year but because the
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
revenues for M&amp;R do fluctuate our
 
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
highest M&amp;R Revenue months are July
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
August September October and
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
November we apply the majority or a
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
larger portion of the municipal fund
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
transfer in those
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
months so we're just spreading that
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
transfer each month based on how
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
in follow
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
up and
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
I but the towns are getting the money
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
every month right the towns get them one
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
payment in the fall they do and we're
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
just this is just our the way out right
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is sits in a fund corre then they
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
get it once correct they actually get it
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
the fund goes negative and we take the
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the year to replenish the
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
fund Yep they're getting in one payment
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative rord yes thank you I
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
just a a couple of questions one on each
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
page here the first one is I think
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
probably an easier question um it's well
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
at least I can ask it easier I don't um
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
on the meals and rooms Municipal Revenue
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
transfer do we have data do we have you
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
have a breakdown kind of H uh revenue
 
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
generated by Town versus how much
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting we're not able to
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
provide that and that goes back to my
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
answer to representative ol earlier
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
where we do have the UniFi the unitary
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
filers so when you have somebody who has
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
25 plus licenses one town is getting all
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
the credit for all those licenses
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so this is um I
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact lawn for me but it
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
is a based on the population I I that
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
another agency um maintains okay great
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
and then by the school building transfer
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and bear with me I'm trying to ask
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
the question so I don't really know what
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
question I want to ask but uh I I I'm
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
just looking at the bond payments are
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
going down I'm assuming that's because
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
we're not building any
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
schools and we haven't built the state
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't you know participated in any of
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh for a number of years
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
which leads me to my I mean and and so
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption one so you can stop
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
me if that's uh that's wrong but the
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
second part oh go ahead I'll say it's um
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes and no why you're not seeing it go
 
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
up is that there hasn't been any new
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
debt taken out but what you are seeing
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
is a typical pay down schedule from that
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
debt that was taken out in 2009 okay and
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
so what you're seeing is over time the
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
interest payments go down but also just
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
the way and I I'm sure treasury can talk
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
to this better than I can just the way
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
the debt is structured it is based on um
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
one principal payment a year and two
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
interest payments a year and they have
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
different coupons at different rates so
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the amount that you pay per fiscal year
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
that is set in stone the day you close
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
on that Bond and it goes to sale okay
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that will go down just because we
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
are paying it off so so that kind of
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
it's not fixed so that leads and that
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
answers part of my question um the other
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
part is so just to understand so we're
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're when we do build schools and we
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
are giving state aid that's debt we do
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
that through debt or are we taking money
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
out of the treasury to do that as well
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
that so the school building a Debt
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
Service you're seeing in the meals and
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
rooms relates to um money that was
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
bonded by the state at the start of the
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
Great Recession so in 2009 2010 2011 the
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
state bonded the um building Aid amounts
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
that was paid to the communities instead
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
of paying out of the general fund or
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
some other fund so that's being paid
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
down right now so that's separate than
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
the building aid program there is still
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
a building aid program um that the state
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
provides funding for that is run by the
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and schools are
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
ranked um based on the type of building
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
that they want to do the need that they
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
have in their community and doe keeps
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
that um that ranking so and and it's
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
capped at $50 million and you may hear
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
something about a tail payment that's
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
Bond payments back to the commun
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
community excuse me state aid back to
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
the community to help them with their
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
bond payment to the buildings that they
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
have bonded so that answers my question
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
much repres El glad I could help I'd
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
just like to add to that that on we made
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
that decision at the beginning of the
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
Great Recession on there was in place a
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
much more generous Municipal uh School
 
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
building aid program uh which was only
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
accessible to the Richer communities
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
that could get bonds through their
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
populace and um they had um they had
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
been on the list they were promised this
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
money and the Great Recession
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
hit and we should not have bonded that
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
money it wasn't something you should
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
Bond but we also should not have have
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
forfeited the promise that had been made
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
to those communities to get the money
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions on these two areas
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows uh yes my
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
question is about page six about the the
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
room and
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
meals transfer and how that's paid it
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
did is what's going on is you look at
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
the um total amount that was raised from
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
room and meals for FY
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
23 and it came to
 
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.229 align:start position:0%
23 and it came to
13.9

01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
13.9
 
01:10:58.239 --> 01:11:00.350 align:start position:0%
13.9
million

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
and that is distributed to the towns
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
fy4 and then these figures I see on the
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
page are those just what you're using as
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
um amounts to for your financial
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
reporting to what are this is to
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
reimburse the fund for those
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
distributions to the to the m uh to the
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities so this is what was
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated and the decision was made that
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
each month we would make a transfer
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
equal to the amount that went out to the
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities in fiscal year 24 and
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
instead of having one month have 130
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
million go out and go negative in that
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
way we spread it out over the course of
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year based on the seasonality
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
of how collections come in so in this
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year right now you've been
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
transferring money to treasury because
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
treasury kind of like fronted the
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
payment for so the last day of the month
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
so if you look at those daily reports
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
that we send out in the back end of the
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
month you'll see on the last business
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
day that M&amp;R will decrease significantly
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
and that's because you're seeing the mun
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
fund transfer go
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
out oh okay um said another way there's
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
essentially a one-year lag in US funding
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
the payment so in fiscal 24 we're
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
funding the payment that was made for
 
01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
funding the payment that was made for
fiscal

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
23 well so so I understand that's what
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing I'm just wondering why it's
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
being done that
 
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
way because you we don't know the final
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
number for fiscal 23 until the fiscal
 
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.110 align:start position:0%
number for fiscal 23 until the fiscal
year

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
closes so we don't know this 13.9
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
million till after the fiscal year has
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
already closed and as Lauren mentioned
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
we spread the amounts throughout the
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
year because otherwise
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
you would take the whole hit of the 13.9
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
million that we need to take out of M&amp;R
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want to take it just in one
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
month so we do it throughout the year so
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
that the revenues are more consistent
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
and you don't and essentially prevents
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
us from panicking in July when it looks
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
like we're
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
13.19 million under
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
plan right representative ORS thank you
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
question so just for clarification your
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
monthly allocation is based on the
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
business that you anticipate pay for
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
that month correct thank
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more questions we'll
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
move on to tobacco tax page seven
 
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.870 align:start position:0%
move on to tobacco tax page seven
tobacco

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
tax okay um
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
so basical year 24 year-to date
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
breakdown we uh revenues are 83% from
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
cigarette stamps and 177% from other
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so that is your loose
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
tobacco and also your ecigarettes
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are 17.9 million
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
or 10.1% below
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
plan we are 20.2 million or
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
11.2% below prior year fiscal year to
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
date through April stamp sales are down
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
15% from fiscal year 23 so what does
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
this all mean basically we're seeing a
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
shift um in consumption to other tobacco
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
products from cigarettes
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
in particular we're seeing a shift to
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes and ecigarettes are taxed
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
differently than traditional cigarettes
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
and taxed differently than other tobacco
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
products and they're essentially taxed
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate so as people move from
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes to ecigarettes
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
or people start taking up a cigarette
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
habit and they utilize ecigarettes where
 
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
habit and they utilize ecigarettes where
historically

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
people would start smoking cigarettes
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
this whole move to ecigarettes is having
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
an impact on
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
revenues um we mentioned when we did the
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
presentation so I just wanted to mention
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
it again at the time there was talk of a
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
national ban on flavored tobacco
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
products we did see an increase in New
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revenues um when Massachusetts
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
baned flavored tobacco products we saw a
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
lot of people come across the border to
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
make those purchases here in New
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has tapered off a bit as
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
folks have learned they can also utilize
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
the internet to make those purchases and
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
have things come directly to their house
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having to drive to New
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but that National ban um
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
has been placed on indefinite hold so we
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
are not anticipating that at this time
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
but we did talk about during Revenue
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
estimating so I wanted to mention it so
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
where do we think fiscal year 24 is
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
going to end um we um estimate that the
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
year year difference um from prior year
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
will remain for the rest of the year
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
which would have us ending at
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
191.000 and then I'll say that for 25
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
this was one of our the harder ones to
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
estimate um this estimate here of
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
189.1 which results in 10.6% below plan
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
is a minus 1% over what we've seen in 24
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
so obviously year to date we're seeing
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
significant decline over prior year and
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
then what we're saying is that that's
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
basically going to only be a 1% decline
 
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:30.830 align:start position:0%
basically going to only be a 1% decline
next

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
year that might be a bit optimistic I'm
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
not really sure this is one of the
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
harder ones for us to estimate but we've
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
seen a significant decline in tobacco
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years and part of
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
me feels like it's just going to kind of
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
even out I think we've seen the increase
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic where a lot of people
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
smoked more than they did previously and
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
also the impact of that Massachusetts
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
band we've kind of come down for that
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
and I I think we're going to right size
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
a bit but that 25 estimate is a tough
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
one just for context if it's helpful
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
very rough
 
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.130 align:start position:0%
very rough
analysis

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.910 align:start position:0%
analysis
[Music]

01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
um cigarettes
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
um so sorry let me start with
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes E ecigarettes are sold in
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
one of two ways either a Clos system
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is what you would consider like a
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
vape pen it is a a device that looks
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
almost like a pen you cannot open it and
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
when it's done you throw it away that's
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
a closed system an open system is where
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
you purchase the liquid and you include
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
it in your own device um that those are
 
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.950 align:start position:0%
it in your own device um that those are
taxed

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
differently um the closed system and
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
open systems trying to compare them to
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
cigarettes roughly when you're talking a
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
closed system so one pen is roughly
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
5,000 Puffs 5,000 Puffs is the
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent to 20 packs of cigarettes so
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
one pen is about 20 packs of cigarettes
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
and one fill up one liquid of an open
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
system is roughly 6,000 Puffs so it's a
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of rough math but basically
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
one fill up of an open system one closed
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
system those equal 20 packs of
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
cigarettes again rough average math
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
costs vary by vendor and store and
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
various other things but an open system
 
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
one fill up that you you would pay 52
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
cents in tax currently a closed system
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
you would pay roughly $4 in
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
tax and then the equivalent 20 packs of
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
cigarettes would be over $35 in tax so
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking at 50 cents
 
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.750 align:start position:0%
you're looking at 50 cents
$4

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
$4
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
$35 so this move to ecigarettes is large
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
contributing to this this reduction that
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
you're seeing in
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
revenues that could potentially affect
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
tax policy yeah sounds like our tax
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
huh yeah be you
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
too representative Aly yeah
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you think that the
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
Menthol bump is still there
 
01:19:25.639 --> 01:19:27.390 align:start position:0%
Menthol bump is still there
from

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think we've seen that
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
come and go I think we've seen the
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the flavor band in
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts gave us an increase in
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue here in New Hampshire people
 
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
were coming across the border um but I
 
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
think they many people maybe it's been
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
effective in Massachusetts and folks
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
have stopped um utilizing flavored
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
tobacco products or like I mentioned
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
they found other places to get um their
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
products I think largely internet you do
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
think it has so I think that has kind of
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
right sized um and that we've come back
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
down I think we are still potentially
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
getting some revenue from it but if the
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
large I think the vast majority of
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
impact of a flavor ban is on your
 
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.510 align:start position:0%
impact of a flavor ban is on your
ecigarettes

01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
right and as we just talked the the
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
revenue there is just so much less than
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
a traditional cigarette that it's yeah
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
not making up that is something else I
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up on other tobacco
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
products used to mean on things that you
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
chewed and left in your in your cheek
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
all day in school uh and uh pipe
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
tobacco and things like that and it
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't very much and I think it's time
 
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
to separate out ecigarettes
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
so we do we trap them separately and
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are taxed separately but we don't
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
see them separately is what I'm I'm
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
saying except where you're talking about
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
it now so on when we put in the tax for
 
01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:05.669 align:start position:0%
it now so on when we put in the tax for
ecigarettes

01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh this body on spent a lot of time
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
developing a fair tax we thought and
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
then uh it got sent to the Senate and
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate cut it down by about 10
 
01:21:19.639 --> 01:21:21.189 align:start position:0%
the Senate cut it down by about 10
times

01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
uh and I think it's worth us trying to
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
fight that battle again because it is
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
addictive it does hurt young people
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
particularly and um and it's hurting our
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
revenues I will say there is um a bill
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
currently I believe in house Commerce
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
for um a study committee or commission
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what version passes to
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
study um the taxation of ecigarettes so
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think there there is an opportunity if
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
that bill passes to do do that
 
01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.510 align:start position:0%
that bill passes to do do that
representative

01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
you for uh taking my question slash
 
01:22:07.229 --> 01:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
comment so if we look at the difference
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
between $35 for 20 packs of cigarettes
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
and $4 which is the higher number then
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking at about
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
85% for
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
the got that wrong under 10% somewhere
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
in there for the revenue that we're
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
getting from
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
taxes that that's your y looks like we
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
may have some bills to file next year
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
to educate the committee um so the tax
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
rate on a pack of cigarettes is $1.78
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's evidenced by a stamp that the
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
wholesalers AFF fixed to the pack of
 
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes Clos system cigarettes those
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
ones that are the pen all-in-one system
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
those are taxed at 30 cents per
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
milliliter open systems when you're just
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
buying the liquid that is 8% of the
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales price and then remaining
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products like pipe tobacco
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
chew I don't know those other things um
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
65.0 3% of the wholesale sales price and
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
that 65.0 3% seems like a strange number
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it is a little bit and that's
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
because when um the tobacco tax went in
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
in were taxing cigarettes and other
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco products the wholesale sales
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
price percentage was determined to be
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat equivalent to the stamp rate as
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
the stamp rate changed the other tobacco
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
products rate changed at the same
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
percent so if the stamp rate went down
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
by 5% the other tobacco products rate
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
went down by 5% and that's how you end
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
up with that weird 65.0 3 it's because
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's a function of a percentage
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
change Senator Lang thank you I was just
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to so it's it's Senate bill um 443
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
is the one that's uh a 433 rather that
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
is I don't know why it came out of ways
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
and means on our side but on your side
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
it went to Commerce um but it's to it's
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
to establish a study committee to look
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
at even the industry itself is having
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
some problems with tax with what's going
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
on with taxing the way they're taxing
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
and what's going on so um they've even
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
asked and supported this new commission
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
to look at that ecigarette tax rate and
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
how being applied and and to the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner's point so just know that
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
that it's currently sitting in
 
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt's committee and if
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
you have a view on tobacco tax you may
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
want to go have a conversation with him
 
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
want to go have a conversation with him
thank

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.629 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
433 thank you and I believe there's a
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
work session
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
elme representative hunts work sessions
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
include 50 bills
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
that are listed without order but anyway
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah this do you
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
on do you know who is supposed to be on
 
01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
on do you know who is supposed to be on
that

01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
Commission because we need
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
representation sure give me one second
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what the bill has so
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
members of the commission
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
are three members of the House one
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
member of De ra one member of The Liquor
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
Commission two members appointed by the
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
governor uh plus one
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
Senator so I would suggest that the
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh go to the speaker and tell him
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
that we should be the members from the
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce that's a you problem not a me
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
problem yeah right
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
that was HB 443 four no SB 433 433 433
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay no pass the Senate came over to the
 
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.590 align:start position:0%
okay no pass the Senate came over to the
house

01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay um if there's no more
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions we'll move on to interest and
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
dividends tax interest and dividends
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay so um even though it's called the
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
interested dividends tax it's more than
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
just interest and dividends that are
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
taxed so I always like to start with the
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.550 align:start position:0%
taxed so I always like to start with the
the

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown so tax year 2021
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
47.5% of the tax was taxable annuities
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
are actual cash and property
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
distributions 38.1% was dividend income
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
99.2% was interest income and 5.2% was
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
federal tax exempt interest income so
 
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
interest income that's exempt federally
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
but taxed here in New Hampshire that's
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
tax year 21 I will say for tax year 22
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers are still preliminary but we
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
are seeing distribution a decrease in
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
distributions um dividend income is see
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
seeing um kind of a flat change but
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
interest income is going up and that
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense with the higher interest
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
rates we saw a very busy April at Dr um
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
largest number of documents on any
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
single day that we had to process and
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
largest number of calls that we received
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
in any single day largely with questions
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
from indd filers who have are have
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
tripped the thresholds this year due to
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
increased interest income so that's
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
where a vast majority of the growth I
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
guess I would say is coming from so
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are 56.7 million
 
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.030 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are 56.7 million
or

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
54.2% ahead of
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
plan 34 million or
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
26.7% ahead of Prior year I will say I
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
think some of that variation from plan
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
is that we weren't sure what was going
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
to happen in the economy at the time
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
that we were doing Revenue estimates and
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
we anticipated some bit of a economic
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
slowdown and maybe a decline in the
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
interest rates and we just haven't seen
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
much of that so distributions are still
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
good and interest is still good and
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
that's driving our change compared to
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
plan um as you all know but as a
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
reminder hb2 from 2023 accelerates the
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
repeal of the interest in dividends tax
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
starting at 4% for the tax year that
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
just ended in December that will go to
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
3% for the tax year year that we are
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
currently in that ends on December 31st
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
of 2024 and then the tax is repealed for
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
tax periods beginning on or after
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
25 so our estimate for fiscal year 24 is
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
actual revenue for the first 10 months
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
with actual revenue from the prior year
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
for the last two months even though we
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
are a bit ahead of plan or sorry
 
01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
significantly ahead of plan and fairly
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
significant ahead of Prior year the
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
remaining Revenue in this year is
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
estimate payments and our estimate
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
payments in April tracked very similar
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
to our estimate payments last April and
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
so we if you assume that that Trend
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
continues into June estimates we just
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
used last year's revenue for May and
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
June looking at fiscal year
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
25 we assumed that this growth would
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
essentially stop that it would be flat
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
um and that but then we had to start
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
applying that rate decrease and the
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate repeal so you'll see the fiscal
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
25 number of
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
109.5 is essentially assuming
 
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
everything's flat but we got to take
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
into account that repeal so we um that's
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
how you end up going down to
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
109.5 which is still 10.1% ahead of the
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
plan that we were originally assuming
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you for taking my
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
question could you remind me um what
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
makes the annuity taxable what's kind of
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
the dividing line oh let me get you that
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
information we have a handy dandy
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
checklist on our form there many types
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
of annuities correct so let me it's
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy but we can get I'll get
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
you yes representative sorry oh yeah
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
follow um you could probably save time
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
basically another way to phrase it is
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
taxable yes okay I would say largely yes
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
but it it's I usually have it printed
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I didn't bring it with me today but
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a nice checklist that goes on our
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
form so I'll make sure you get a
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
copy representative
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you um we spent a lot of
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
time talking about some of our other
 
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
time talking about some of our other
taxes

01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
um looking at this year's Revenue we we
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
also talked about the diversity of um
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
payers into the business profits and
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax I'm looking more
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
at all of our Revenue um as a
 
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
portfolio and I see a lot of our
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
revenues went down this year or were at
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
least below plan um whereas this was
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
very much above plan and really kind of
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
Saved our bacon so I am surprised that
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about our over overall
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
um kind of portfolio diversity as a
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
state and the fact that we're we're
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
losing this um one of our charges as a
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee is to pay attention to the
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
health of the treasury and so I just
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
want to raise my concerns about the
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
health of the treasury going forward um
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
because of how this is kind of PL panned
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
out this year our very last slide does a
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
nice comparison of all the tax types
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
compared to plan for 24 and for 25 and I
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
think that'll be a nice way to see those
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
that are underperforming those that are
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
overperforming and will give you a
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
better feel as a whole for at least the
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
taxes that Dr collects how the health of
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the treasury overall for dr's portfolio
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
of taxes so that's the very last slide
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
we'll talk through that and that only
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
goes through 2025 correct and if I
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand correctly we still have half
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
kind of half a year of income because of
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
the way the fiscal year Works am I
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
getting that right so there's two months
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
remaining in this fiscal year okay um
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
with the June 30th end um but kind of
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
what you're think about is the
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislature turns over halfway through
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
fy2 so I'm thinking about the repeal oh
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
sorry in December okay and so in 2025
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're noting that we'll we still
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
have like six months of income correct
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
coming from this tax correct and so when
 
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
we do the revenue estimate to come up
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
109.5 we do look at how the revenue
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
comes in within the fiscal year and what
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
tax years that's attributed to so April
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
is a good example we have returns and
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
extensions that we receive in April and
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
that was for the tax year that ended in
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
December but also in April we received
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
estimate payments for the tax year that
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're currently in and so that's why the
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
revenue doesn't end abruptly when the
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
tax is repealed because there's
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
essentially a delay in receiving those
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
returns and extensions and estimates
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
come in early so we Factor all of that
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
in and do the analysis of how much
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
revenue we're receiving for each tax
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
year when we come up with these
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
estimates thank you I think that the I
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
just want to make one more statement
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
because the point I'm trying to make is
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
although you're providing us with
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
projections that take us through
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
2025 correct you know I plan on living
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire after
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
2025 um
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
so you know we're facing a cliff that
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about today and we're
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
not really going to talk about
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
until we look at the budget for the
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
future so I just i' want to underline
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we spent a lot of time talking
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
about taxes that are worth like a third
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
or a sixth of this number that we're
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
just skipping over so I just want to
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
make that say that out loud for people
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
who are watching at
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
home representative elme uh thank you
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is just going back to
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
annuities on I believe that Mo almost
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
all of that uh is the parts that are
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
taxable are the parts that you haven't
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
didn't already pay taxes on correct when
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
the annuities got set
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
up but
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
um to speak to representatively please
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
com comment I think I said on the floor
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
before that this tax is the only one
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
besides small consumption taxes that
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
gets paid by on very wealthy people who
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
moved into the state after creating
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
their wealth
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
Services represent ORS thank you Mr
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
so having done budgeting like you're
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
doing here and estimating on millions
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
and billions of
 
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
dollars would you let us know if you
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
thought we were going off off a
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
financial cliff would you be able to
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
look at that in the future and be able
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
to make it determine if you thought we
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
were going to fall over to Cliff with
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
all the Lemmings
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
or well I think the the determination of
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
going over the cliff you have to look at
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
both the revenue side and the
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
expenditure side right that you got to
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
take both into account so we're only
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
going to talk to this committee
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
generally about the revenue side and
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
then you're going to as a legislature
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
work with the finance committee on the
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
spend side so I guess the cliff is
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat relative when you put those two
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
together and that's what Chris Shay
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
likes to do
 
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.669 align:start position:0%
likes to do
um

01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:30.679 --> 01:36:32.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's and the LBA does a very nice job
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget process of kind of
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
providing a nice summary of what if your
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates look like versus your
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
spending estimates and so we have not
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
looked at fiscal years 26 and 27 in this
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
presentation that would be part of the
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
budget process that will kick
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
off in the fall we'll start follow about
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
that follow up so just to re-emphasize
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the question is there something
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's keeping you awake at night as you
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
look through these numbers say oh my
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
gosh all of
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
Chris I'll just say
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's this I think this year in
 
01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.270 align:start position:0%
it's this I think this year in
particular

01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.109 align:start position:0%
particular
has

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
been um notable to me in a number of
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
ways one as I mentioned earlier how
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
close we are to the business tax
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
estimate I don't remember the last time
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we were so close but we're also off
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit with tobacco you know below
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
plan and we'll talk about real estate
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
transfer tax quickly at the end that is
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
below plan as well and then you know as
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
we're discussing indd is performing
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and I think that this has
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
been essentially the some of the more
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
challenging Revenue new estimating that
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've done in recent years um because
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
it's you know I don't think any of us
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic would have said Yep
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
this pandemic is just going to propel us
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
into unprecedented economic growth right
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be in a prolonged
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
state of economic growth so it's just
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
all of it's just surprising yeah so
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
you've been in in this Dr for 14 years
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
how long have you been uh commissioner
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh since December of 2017 seven years
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think I have faith in
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
you pleas someone thank you I think
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
let's um let's move on to communication
 
01:38:30.199 --> 01:38:31.709 align:start position:0%
let's um let's move on to communication
Services

01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
tax right not nearly as exciting as
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
everything else we've discussed so um so
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
um looking at the communication Services
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
tax fiscal year to date we are a half a
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
million or 2% ahead of plan and fiscally
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
year to date we are um just a little bit
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
over a half a million or 2.4% ahead of
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
the prior so basically it's been
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
relatively stable this tax and some of
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
the things that we have been looking at
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I've been drilling into is the
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
taxability of the video conferencing and
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
the use of product of that those kind of
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
products as people are shifting away
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
from the work from home and doing more
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
time back in the office and also
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
noticing that decrease in the use of
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP and
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously what we've been talking
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
about a long time that decrease in
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
traditional telephone
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
so with that said what I have been
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
noticing is that there has been some um
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
and more recently some decreased
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
liabilities from these taxpayers and
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
also using some credits that were on
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
account so some there is a little bit of
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward because the way
 
01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
this tax is paid is you make an estimate
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the month in which you're incurring
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
the liability and then you're supposed
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
to true it up the next month but
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes um people just want to give us
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
money and there's no Rhyme or Reason why
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
so as a result um we are not revising
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
our estimate for fiscal year 24 or 25
 
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
because there's a little bit of risk
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we might eat up that half a million
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
that we are ahead right now and I we
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
don't see anything that would indicate
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
any major changes in this area okay
 
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
any major changes in this area okay
thank

01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
you if there are no questions on this
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
tax we will move on to the real estate
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
transfer tax which might create a few
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
more questions so real estate transfer
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
tax tax we are 22.5 million or 12.9%
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
below plan fiscal year to date we are
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
also 29.4 million or
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
16.2% below prior year this is net of
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
the $5 million transfer to the
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
fund why are we below plan um there is
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
an inven inventory shortage cost of
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
building is high so new homes are not
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
being built and then also just a lower
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
affordability um Factor so the New
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
actually publishes this this statistic
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we've included in here about a
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
housing affordability index and as an
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
example of index of 120 would mean that
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
the median income in New Hampshire is
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
120% of what is necessary to qualify for
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
a median priced home so median income
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
compared to median priced home under the
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
prevailing interest rates for March that
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
affordab affordability index was
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
59% so the median income is only 59% of
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
what you would need to qualify for um a
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage for a median priced home which
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think just crossed
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
over $500,000 in this past
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
month um for a single family home and
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's just over $400 almost 410,000 for a
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
condo and those are from the March
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
numbers um mortgage rates are uh
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
7.51% for a 30-year fixed at the end of
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
April and that is obviously the highest
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in some
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
time so what do we expect for fiscal
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
year 24 we expect that the
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
year-over-year uh growth or decline of
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
16 and a half% will
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
continue and then again this was another
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
tough one for
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
25 um I just kept the number flat from
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
24 to 25 I do hope that mortgage rates
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
will ease up a little bit that we will
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
see some more inventory hit the market
 
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
we will know better in the next few
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
months the winter in New Hampshire is
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
slow for realtors the spring and summer
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
is when we typically see houses start to
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
come onto the market and to move um so
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
we will have a better idea um going into
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
fall um but we we've just kept it
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
flat um I think if interest rates ease
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
up at all that will also help and I
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
think we discussed during the revenue
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
estimating process that there is a fair
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
amount of anecdotal evidence out there
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
or anecdotal stories of people are
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're waiting they want you know they
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
want to buy they've been sitting in what
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be their starter house
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
for much longer than they anticipated
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
but something things got to give before
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
they're able to enter the market either
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
there we need to have the inventory on
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
the market to sell or the building has
 
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
to increase and certainly the interest
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
rates need to come down to make it more
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
folks questions representative fellows
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I just this is a difficult um thing
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
to try to Pro predict but my thought is
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
that the mortgage rate really isn't very
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
important because the the main issue is
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
that there are very few homes available
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
to buy and and that most of the people
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
who are buying them are not getting a
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage you know so I I don't know that
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
those factors are important so I don't
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
see any
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
change I just don't think that will I
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a major factor in
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen so the only the
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
only way
 
01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
to get more sales is is probably to have
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
more uh inventory new inventory created
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
I would think I understand what you're
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
saying in that the the homes that are
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
coming on the market are going to go to
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
those that are able to pay cash I think
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they the inventory
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
really did get to a point where there
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
was excess inventory that's where you're
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to see the mortgage rates creating
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
a problem because those folks who can't
 
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
pay cash would need a mortgage and they
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
would buy if it were not for the
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates so I
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
think it they the mortgage rates could
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
hamper our acceleration in the real
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax if the inventory
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
starts to come online but again to your
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
point we can't collect the tax if the
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
house doesn't sell so if there's nothing
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
to sell there's no tax to collect and
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
we've talked routinely in this committee
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
about the balance between you can
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
sustain a higher real estate transfer
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
tax on fewer transactions if the price
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
is High um and you can sustain the real
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax on lower price
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
transactions if you have the higher
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
volume so it's always the balance
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
but I think what we're hearing more and
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
more lately is it's it's just the
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
inventory that there are people on the
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
sidelines even with cash to your point
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
where the mortgage rate might not matter
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
but there's just nothing for them to buy
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's no inventory there
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you what would you believe that
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
everything you've just said is accurate
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
and true I hope
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
so uh so uh I I spent about an hour
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday with the uh
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
finance committee and the the revenue
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee Rockingham County part of my
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
job and we spent a good portion of that
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
meeting talking about the real estate
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
transfer tax I would just like to add
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
that I would emphasize what I heard
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday was it's about the number of
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
transactions that are going on is what I
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
heard from the people in Rockingham
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
County yes high prices and interest
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
rates and all and inventory
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
which does then affect the number of
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
transactions and that's what they seem
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
to be most concerned about the number of
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
transactions would you believe thank you
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
I would I and and like I said we've
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
discussed for a long time about the
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
balance between the two and this is
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
probably one of the first times where I
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
just outright said it's a volume problem
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
at this point it's a volume problem and
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a volume problem that the price
 
01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.990 align:start position:0%
it's a volume problem that the price
can't

01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
fix representative Lee Le thank you
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there's a bill
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
sitting on the table in the house uh 454
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
that would address this problem it came
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
out of this commission out of this
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee excuse me by doubling the
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
amount that goes into the affordable
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
funding affordable housing fund that you
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
just mentioned that $5 million goes into
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
currently and um I would encourage
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
members of this committee who are
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about our stagnant um
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
inventory and the fact that that people
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
can't buy or sell and therefore our
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
revenue is not is has really been
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
impacted by this and the projection that
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're hearing is that our Revenue will
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
be will continue to be affected by our
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
lack of inventory so I would ask members
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
of this committee to consider asking
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
their leaders to vote to untable that
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can learn more about how
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
that might uh from a policy perspective
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
persective we might be able to address
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
this um that might help us increase our
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
revenues going forward since we know
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be missing $86 million
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
from the IND tax thank
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
you let's try to let's try to keep this
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
to a Dr update I I understand members
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
have passions on certain things given
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
the time given the time is 12:30 and we
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
still have a little more to do here uh
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh Aly followed by
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
fellows yes can I ask a question about
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh the assessment
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau or is that too far off topic uh
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
the relationship to
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
this on
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
the on people are starting to wonder on
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
I live in a house that was assessed at
 
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.870 align:start position:0%
I live in a house that was assessed at
239,000

01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
on 100 uh whatever it is
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
239,000 I guess on and on my neighbor
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
bought for
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
500 um and then the next neighbor bought
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh sold for 500 and the next neighbor
 
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
sold for four
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
470 after waiting five months CU he
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
wanted 500 and on when we get to
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
assessing are we going to access all of
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
our properties on at this new level that
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
is only available to a very small number
 
01:49:37.639 --> 01:49:38.750 align:start position:0%
is only available to a very small number
of

01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
buyers or how is the assessing going to
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
be done isn't this really a town town
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
the assing town issue but it's part of
 
01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.750 align:start position:0%
the assing town issue but it's part of
the

01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
Dr and well we monitor the assessor so
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
the assessing is done at the Town level
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that assessments
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
deviate significantly from market value
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
then that's where our Equalization
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
Bureau comes in and produces an
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
equalization ratio every year so that
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
towns know how far their assessments are
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
off of market value the real estate
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
transfer tax flow is always going to be
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
collected on the sales price so it is a
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
a strictly sales price calculation that
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
I understand I just think we're heading
 
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
toward cliff on that issue well and
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
remember too with the assessed value is
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
that there's two there's two sides to a
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
calculation when it comes to your
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
assessed value if your assessed value
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
increases 20% and that is the average
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the assessed value in your
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
community and there is no increase to
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
your budget there will be no no change
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
to your tax
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill Dr has been working hard over the
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
years to educate Property Owners on that
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
and that a a straight increase to your
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
assessed value does not mean that same
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
percentage increase to your property tax
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
bill it's you need to look at your
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
relative increase to the average and you
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
also should attend your town meeting and
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the budget that's going
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
to be passed in your town um so it's
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's two sides to the equation yeah
 
01:51:20.719 --> 01:51:23.069 align:start position:0%
it's two sides to the equation yeah
right

01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so what is I have two
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
questions what is the real estate
 
01:51:31.629 --> 01:51:31.639 align:start position:0%
transfer tax rate and my second question
 
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
is if somebody were to buy a property
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
and then build um apartments on that
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
property and they keep it and those are
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
rentals they obviously pay the transfer
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
tax when they buy the the uh land or
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
whatever there is it correct that when
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
there all those apartments are built
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's really no real estate tax
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
involved at that point correct so the
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax is a150 per
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
thousand and half of that is paid by the
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
buyer and half of that is paid by the
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
seller so 75 cents per ,000 by the buyer
 
01:52:13.149 --> 01:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
75 cents per thousand by the seller it
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
is only it only happens when the real
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
estate is transferred so when it is sold
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
so if you buy a piece of undeveloped
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
land for $30,000
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you build a $5 million house on it
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to collect the real estate
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
transfer tax on the $30,000 and we will
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
collect nothing else until that changes
 
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
hands or is sold again at the five
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
million right at that point the town
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
will start collecting correct the local
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue based on the assessed value
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
right y yeah okay any more qu yes
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Lindsay great
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
presentation um on on the real estate
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
transaction the one thing I will say
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about mortgage uh
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about mortgage rates
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
the interest rate makes a huge
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
difference in your monthly payment right
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
so again so when you're dealing with
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and you have a 7%
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage rate on a $450,000 loan you're
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
looking at $29.93 for a payment but that
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
same mortgage rate at 3% uh this that
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment at 3% is only
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
$1,800 right so that's the impact of
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
what a mortgage means when we're talking
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
about people's ability to afford a house
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
so even right now our problem with with
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
transaction the number of transaction we
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
have is a combination of a high mortgage
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
rate salaries may or may not have gone
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
up but they haven't kept up with the
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
mortgage rate and pricing people out of
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
homes with their average mortgage
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
payment um and so the mortgage rate
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
represented the fellow's point is
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important in the number of
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
transactions we have because people
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
aren't qualifying because the rate's so
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
high and they have a $29.93 payment
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
instead of an $1,800 payment and what I
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
may be able to do the $1,800 payment but
 
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
I can't do the $22,900 payment and so
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the major impacts
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
which we talk about how that is not a
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
big factor I think it's a huge Factor we
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
have inflated prices and inflated
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
interest rate which is pricing people
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
out of the market which is reducing our
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
number of transactions right until both
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
those we could maybe survive an
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
increased um cost of a house but we
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
can't survive increase of of mortgage
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
rates on top of the increased cost um so
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
I just want to be careful of that and
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about affordable
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
housing interest rate plays a huge
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
impact because the what's defined as an
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
affordable house is based on your
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of income which is based on
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
the mortgage rate and your monthly
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
payment and so what could be an
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
affordable house for one person now is
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
out of out of their range because of the
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
7% and and you know we were in the
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
Senate looking at the r we actually
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
reduced it because we were concerned
 
01:54:43.149 --> 01:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
about the out of control inflation rate
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
and out of control um increase prices so
 
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know that again we're not going
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem here today um but
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
I do think it's going to continue into
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
our next cycle unless we see mortgage
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
rates slow down and and come down and
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
then you never mind the fact you have
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
someone like me singing in a three
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom house with by myself I'm
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
not going to give up my 2.9% mortgage to
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
go take a 7% mortgage so my house isn't
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
going on the market which normally we
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
would see but it's not going to happen
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
as long as the mortgage rates are as
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
high as they are so just and I think
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's what that statistic that 59%
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
affordability injects from the Realtor
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
Association that's their their way of
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
kind of synthesizing exactly what you
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
just said right take the median income
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
median home price and the interest rate
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
and what does that mean and right now it
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
means your a median income only gets you
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
59% of what you need to buy a
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
house thank you representative ORS thank
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just wanted to thank the
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the other side of the
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
wall for a very clear and pithy uh
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
statement thank you representa Aly yes
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh that is why
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh the affordable housing community
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't build houses or get involved in
 
01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
building houses at this point it's
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
mostly rental units and then it's part
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the business model of the the uh
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
transaction to try and figure out how to
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
to um Finance it but it doesn't come
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
down to the level of what the rents
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
are okay okay yes again so we talk about
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
the the affordable the the invest in h
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
fund that we were talking about earlier
 
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
again I talked to a developer and
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
represent mom who was up in your area
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
who's backed out got to invest in age
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
funds but backed out because the cost of
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
materials the cost of Labor the cost of
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
everything is so high that the price of
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
the house is so high that it no longer
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
meets due to the interest rates what
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
would qualify as an affordable house and
 
01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
so you can't give them enough money to
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
even build a house uh as a developer so
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a little C we're kind
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
of run chasing our tail a little bit but
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
just understand that even with the100
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
million investment or $110 million
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
investment we did in invest NH Builders
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
and developers are still not building
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
affordable houses because of the
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
interest rates they can't they would
 
01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
have to price the house so high that
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
they would no longer qualify due to the
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
interest rates uh where they might have
 
01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
a person who qualifies for the house if
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
it was lower back at the 2.9% versus the
 
01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
um 7% so again I think we're kind of
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
little chasing our tail here but I'm not
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
sure we can buy our way out with the
 
01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:29.719 align:start position:0%
best and H money either representative
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair with all due
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
respect to all my colleagues and to be
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
clear I'm pretty heavily involved in the
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
nasua Affordable Care movement and
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
concerns I don't think that this is the
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
time or place to be discussing this
 
01:57:46.199 --> 01:57:46.910 align:start position:0%
time or place to be discussing this
thank

01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
you with that we will move on to the
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
utility property tax almost there
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
y almost there so uh the utility
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
property tax we are we are revising our
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
plan up
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
99.8% for fiscal year 24 and then um we
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
are keeping the fiscal year 25 plan
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
unchanged and some of the factors that
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
we were looking at is that fiscal year
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
to date we are 4.1 million or 12.7%
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
ahead of our plan we are also 15.2% of
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
over the prior Year and that increase in
 
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue compared to the prior and plan
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
is due to increased
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
valuations and also on what was
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
collected last year was reduced by
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who had um credit carryovers
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
or carry forwards that were applied in
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 so that's where you why
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that uh double digit
 
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
growth but however for 25 um other
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
things that we need to take into
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
consideration is that some property
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
values May decline due to changes in
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
economic conditions and we might have
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
new taxable property that could be
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
constructed or we can have taxable
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
property come offline so we're leaving
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
that flat so for 24 that plan that we is
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're just recognizing the actual to
 
01:59:12.669 --> 01:59:12.679 align:start position:0%
date and keeping the plan unchanged for
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
May and June and 25 is no change from
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
plan and do we have any questions for
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
utility property tax thank you I'm going
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
to take a maximum of two questions on
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
this one and so we can move on to the
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
final page yes represent fellows so um
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
and the utilities that are are taxed is
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
any of that coming from solar
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
installations to the extent that it is
 
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
qualified as a utility under the
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
definition of utility and the utility
 
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
property tax it would yes anybody else
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay we stayed under the two person
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
limit all right Dr revised estimates
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
okay so last page as I mentioned this
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
just summarizes everything onto one page
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
so you will see um for and again this is
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
just for the taxes that Dr collects you
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
will see that for fiscal year 24 our
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
revised estimates um result in 10.8
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
million ahead of plan or a half a
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
percent and then in 25 we're estimating
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we would be under planned by 57.2
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
million or
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
2.6% so again just a nice place to kind
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
of see all of Dr taxes together in one
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
place you can see the comparisons to
 
02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
plans so you can see those taxes that
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
are performing above plan and those that
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
are performing below plan or at
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
plan thank you any questions on this
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
page seeing none thank you very much
 
02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
page seeing none thank you very much
thank

02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
and now we will invite uh Mr Chet back
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
end so I just want to take you again
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
back to the revenue Focus that I handed
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
out at the start of the meeting I had
 
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
quickly pointed to the first table on
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
page one and then a table on page
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
three there's a number of tables on page
 
02:01:21.639 --> 02:01:22.589 align:start position:0%
three there's a number of tables on page
two

02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
so you talk about your red analysis
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
it'll show you some information as the
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
as the revenues come in for that the
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms and the distributions
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
associated with that so these things all
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
connect to the presentation that Dr was
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
refunds on the bottom of the fourth page
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's a new table it's the primary
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
Comm components of your other Revenue so
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
we've identified that interest in
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
dividends is uh far exceeding plan other
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
revenue is also far exceeding plan but
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a sustainable and the reason
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
for that is that it's cash that's in the
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
bank right now that treasury has a lot
 
02:02:08.189 --> 02:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
of arpa funds a lot of um uh education
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund balance and rainy day fund
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
balance those monies that they're now
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
earning interest is now helping your
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
general fund and other funds with the
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
um with the other revenue and you can
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
see if you look at that table on the
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
bottom of page four excuse me page three
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm sorry I'm you you can see
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
that the interest revenue on surplus
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
funds is at 80.7
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
million plan was only $25.8
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
million so as you start to spend down
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds that sit in the bank
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the interest Revenue
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
away the bottom of page three
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
I said four just to see if people were
 
02:02:57.149 --> 02:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
02:02:57.159 --> 02:03:00.149 align:start position:0%
paying attention
but

02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes so again that was one of it's one of
 
02:03:04.069 --> 02:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
those revenues that's been doing very
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
well it's been helping keep the um
 
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.629 align:start position:0%
well it's been helping keep the um
plan

02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
ahead along with that if you were to
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
look at the insurance tax that's ahead
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
of plan by about $22.3
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
million part of the reasons for that is
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
your um Property and Casualty um you
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
know your automobile and house
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance is up as the uh
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
cost to replace those types of things is
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
up so the premiums are up on those types
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
of insurances as well as in the medical
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
side of it there was some um
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
conservative estimates early on by the
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
insurance department around the medical
 
02:03:41.550 --> 02:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
aspects because they didn't know how
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
some of the um new technologies were
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to impact the the markets and
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
those Technologies being things like new
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
medicines that are pretty expensive or
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
treatments that are pretty expensive and
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
how those might um be used or not used
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
if given a choice as well as um the um
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
Professional Care has been real has been
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
higher than it has been typically in the
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
past so those are some reasons why
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
you've seen the insurance premium tax um
 
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
doing better than
 
02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
planned um I'd like to note as well that
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
your uh transfer from The Liquor
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
Commission is trending downward the last
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
couple of months some of that may be the
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
effort of people to um drink less
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol consume less alcohol some people
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
shifting away from alcohol to
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis um so those are a couple of
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
examples that the Liquor Commission
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
suggested as to seen some Trends as to
 
02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
decreasing the other one is Lottery
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue which all goes into the
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that's ahead of
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
plan by $30
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
million and as I noted at the start your
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is below plan by
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
$24 million so if your lottery Revenue
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing so well the education trust
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
fund would be um not as not as healthy
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
as it is so I just wanted to highlight
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
those couple of
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
taxes um just to make sure it's not just
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
the Dr Revenue but there's other Revenue
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
sources that you need to be considering
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
as you um think about the impact on the
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
state budget going forward for the rest
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the 2425 bayum but also as you start
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
to think about building a new budget in
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
6 and
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
27 on page four you have the other two
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
types of funds that this committee is
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for estimating which is the
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
fund both of those are
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
um excuse me the highway fund is
 
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
slightly under plan and the fishing game
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
fund is trending a little bit above
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
plan we'll see how that fishing game um
 
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
continues to Trend because it's now you
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
know fishing season and how many more
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
licenses they might be selling and
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
things like that but again those are
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
other two funds that this committee
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
should also be keeping an eye on As you
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
move forward through the next fiscal
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
year there was a question um raised
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
earlier about you know this is only half
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
the equation you know who keeps an eye
 
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
on the on the entire process and it's
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
our office we look at all the
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures and we look to see what's
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
happening with those we look at the
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
revenues and to see what's happening
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
with that and we try to keep an eye on
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
what was anticipated to happen and as to
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
and then apply what changes are being
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
made throughout the course of the year
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
um to give us a new point in time um
 
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
status so I'll hand this out after but
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
it's a simple one-page document that our
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
office updates every month at the end of
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 you expected to close the
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
general fund with a balance of 3.2
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
million and it was anticipated the
 
02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fund was going to close
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
million when the um annual comprehensive
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
financial report came out the actual
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
fund balance to the education trust fund
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
was $32.5 Million higher so we had a
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
$264.83 million below for the education
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund as well as there was 40.8
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
million of appropriation variance so
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
basically when the um education trust
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
fund excuse me when the adequacy
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
payments for the education trust fund
 
02:07:31.159 --> 02:07:32.030 align:start position:0%
payments for the education trust fund
were

02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
calculated as well as the efas as well
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
as any other money that is um
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
appropriated out of the education trust
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
fund it was found that the budget was
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
$40 million short there's open
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation language so that the
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner can draw down the funds
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
necessary for that so that was a $40
 
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.030 align:start position:0%
necessary for that so that was a $40
million

02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
variance so we project at the end of 25
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bium your education
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund will only have a balance of
 
02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:00.470 align:start position:0%
trust fund will only have a balance of
197.4

02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
197.4
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
million with the general fund I said you
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
had a starting balance of
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
3.2 through Revenue your plan is 68.8
 
02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:11.109 align:start position:0%
3.2 through Revenue your plan is 68.8
million

02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
ahead we anticipated a lapse at the end
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the um this year of $76 million right
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
now the agencies are forecasting um it's
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
going to be about 40
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
42 is so we're about $34 million short
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
of the lapse at this point in time we
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
know we're going to get more money but
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're not sure if we're going to get the
 
02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
we're not sure if we're going to get the
full

02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
76 there's also been a number of
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are statutorily
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowed um 24 almost $25 million of
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
these Appropriations these
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are things like workers
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
comp unemployment the death penal death
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
penalty uh excuse me death benefit for
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
individuals who die in the line of
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
service police officers um EMTs people
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
like that um as well as Appropriations
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
that are allowed to be drawn statutorily
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
through fiscal those are limited those
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
are things like litigation in the
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice engine and defense
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
through the judicial Council medical and
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
um Dental through the Department of
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
Corrections are the three big ones
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
there's a few smaller ones but there's a
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
very much a limited amount that can be
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
drawn through fiscal but again these
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate ation are not budgeted so
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's $25 million of unbudgeted
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
far and to date uh the legislature has
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
passed $200,000 of Appropriations
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
through legislative specials this year
 
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
which sounds good so far until you hear
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
that right now between the house and the
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
Senate you have $138 million of General
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
funds in Appropriations and the various
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
bills that you have out there you have
 
02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
another 82.9 9 million of Education
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund Appropriations contained in
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
bills that are still active between the
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
house and the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Senate so again we we worry about those
 
02:10:02.669 --> 02:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
types of things in our office because
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
you may look like you got a big balance
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
this year you start passing bills that
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
have an impact not only in 25 but
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
they'll have an impact in your next
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
budget so I think to get to your
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
question represent ORS it we do take a
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
look at that um we do share this
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
information with leadership um both in
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
the uh majority and minority parties and
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's up to the legislative
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
body to make those
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
decisions if uh for some reason your
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
revenues were at a tank the executive
 
02:10:35.549 --> 02:10:35.559 align:start position:0%
office um would have would be charged
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
with trying to manage the budget that
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
they have before them and they would
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
need to make some hard decisions if if
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
that were to happen so I don't want to
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
keep you all afternoon but I just wanted
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
to throw a few little tidbits at you and
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll leave you with is
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
just understand that um you're talking
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
about revenues and potential changes
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
this does nothing to change the revenues
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
that are part of the plan those are
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
passed as part of the law the budget
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
Bill law so unless you amend that the
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
revenue plan you see for 25 will be
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
based on the revenues that were passed
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget and the
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments in the Surplus statement but
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
it is good information for you to know
 
02:11:19.229 --> 02:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
now thank you
 
02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you you covered part
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
of my question just looking at the
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
numbers um when I look into
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
2026 I see a loss of 150 to 200 million
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of the indd tax so
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
somehow that's going to have to be made
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
up either by um cutting the finance
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
budget um or really increasing some
 
02:11:50.189 --> 02:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
others so I see that as a dilemma we
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
also have some giant bills coming um
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
depending what happens legally so I
 
02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
guess to me and I don't need a long
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
answer it seems like 2026 is going to be
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
a very creative year for your
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
department uh we're not super excited
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
about 26 and 27 I I don't think you're
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
going to see the same revenues you've
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
seen in the last couple of budget
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
Cycles um there's going to be harder
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
decisions being made you're absolutely
 
02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.669 align:start position:0%
decisions being made you're absolutely
correct

02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
um there's been bills passed there's
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
been Appropriations provided to agencies
 
02:12:25.149 --> 02:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
to to enhance and further develop
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
programs within certain agencies to
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
sustain that they're M there's going to
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
need to be some give and take um so the
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
governor will have the first crack at
 
02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
building a budget the new governor um
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and then it'll come to the legislature
 
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of decisions will have to be
 
02:12:40.589 --> 02:12:40.599 align:start position:0%
made but you're you're absolutely
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
correct reps Southworth it's it's going
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
difficult representative
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
duet thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
my question Chris you want into uh some
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
forecasting as to legislation that's
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
still basically in front of us did you
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
look at the opportunities in legislation
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
to capture new Revenue I'm I'm talking
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
to a specific piece and what effect that
 
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
may have or any others so if if a piece
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation has a revenue impact we
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
would note that in our fiscal notes so
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
on every bill that has an FN or Bill
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's been amended that has a fiscal
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
impact we will do a fiscal note for and
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
in that we will note if there's um you
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
know the revenue estimate because we do
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
work with the agencies that are the
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
expert in those areas to get an an
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
essence or estimate of what it might be
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the change that that's being
 
02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
proposed in that legislation so we do we
 
02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
do try to take that impact what I
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier were just
 
02:13:42.510 --> 02:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations nothing talking about um
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue side because it's just a lot and
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
an not for us we were pretty surprised
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
right it's it's an off-budget year and
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of legisl specials with
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in it more than you
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.709 --> 02:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
experienced uh yes I'll move this way
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang I'm sorry because I missed
 
02:14:05.229 --> 02:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
you said there was 197 million projected
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund in Surplus
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
did you give a number for the general
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
fund and if so I just missed it what
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
your what it looks like going forward
 
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
now 112. six thank you and I may not
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
have said it I may have missed that but
 
02:14:20.549 --> 02:14:20.559 align:start position:0%
I'll give the she all these expenditures
 
02:14:20.559 --> 02:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
I'll give the she all these expenditures
and

02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.629 --> 02:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what was the question again so
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
my question was what is the projected
 
02:14:30.189 --> 02:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
general fund Surplus okay um and it was
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
112 million minus any expenditures we
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
might do is the legislature that might
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
that representative le le thank you Mr
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
chair I have two questions um the first
 
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
is do you have that written out the the
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
numbers that we that you just shared
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
with us this is it and the second
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
question is the tobacco settlement money
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
is that stop at some point or do we know
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
when it ends and is it like a steady
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
decline so how's that I thought it
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't forever I I don't think it stops
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
but the amount will change every year
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
and is that based on their profits how
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's based on a number of different
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
things and I'm not even going to try to
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
pretend I can do you know give you an
 
02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
explanation but the Department of
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
Justice has a person who's assigned to
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
track that and monitoring you know the
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
sales and what's going on in other
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
states and what things might be
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
impacting the tobacco sales here as well
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
as in other places and then they there's
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
also some legalities that are being
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
settled through the courts and and
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
negotiations so those sometimes have an
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
impact we did well we got just under the
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
40 million this year last few years
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
we've exceeded planed but there's been
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
years it's come in under um perf and doj
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
just does the best they can but they
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
know it's really not till April do they
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
know the exact number that ansers my
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
question and all that um just to so you
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
know the up to 40 million goes directly
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund any amount
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
over 40 million goes to the general
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
fund representative
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr
 
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
chair do you have numbers on the amount
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
efas um we can get that I think the
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation this year was $24 million
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
I think is what they um was the cost of
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
what they put out this year that that
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
was um that was what was appropriated
 
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
but we know what the the amount
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated was 30 million there was an
 
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
amount a piece and House Bill 2 that
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
reduced that by $10
 
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
million but there's an open
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation language so can you get us
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
yep representative fellows thank you so
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
um you were telling us um some like an
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
example you told us that in education
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund there were um not
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures have exceeded what was in
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
the budget by 40 something uh million
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
correct and so when you those things
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
that you told us and about fiscal
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
expending approving 25 million are those
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
in here so on if you look at that same
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
line that you see the 40 million in
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
education you see the
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
24.9 that's that's the amount that would
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
goone has gone through fiscal or the
 
02:17:24.509 --> 02:17:24.519 align:start position:0%
governor has drawn down money for it's
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
not all fiscal and I just want to make
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
sure you they're both in they're it's in
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's in here okay yep the 40.8 that's
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
again EFA and that and um the other
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
piece was the free and reduced amounts
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
um when the adequacy was done they
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
updated the numbers and it increased the
 
02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation need okay
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
thanks but again I just want to remind
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
people the fiscal committee has a very
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
limited ability to appropriate funds um
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes confusion that fiscal
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
has the ability um to appropriate money
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know if if you had a program that's
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
falling short you want them to give them
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
more money they just can't do that they
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
have to be statutorily allowed and
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
that's pretty limited what fiscal
 
02:18:07.549 --> 02:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee does do though is accept a lot
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
of federal funds so if an agency got a
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
grant or is awarded federal funds or
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
other funds being transferred from an
 
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
agency for a grant purpose they come
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
through fiscal and they can budget that
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
question yes Senator so again just I
 
02:18:27.309 --> 02:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that $4.8 million uh
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure that's in there that was
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
unprojected uh out of the budget so
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
again that also would include we
 
02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
adjusted the educ education uh formula
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with increases in free and
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
reduce and increase in extraordinary
 
02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
need Aid based on property values and
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the change in a student that moves
 
02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you may have the same
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
number of students but you had a
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
thousand more that are now under free
 
02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
and reduc
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
going to create an expit and that
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
thousand more may also then adjust that
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil for free
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
and reduced um as well and give grants
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
more grants to those communities so
 
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
again it it encompasses a lot of
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures not just uh we passed a
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill to give it to fund some new program
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh we were using data the best data at
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
the time when you were projecting your
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
budget shortly after the passage of the
 
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
budget doe got revised data going into
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
the fall um and then applied that to the
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
next adequacy um for
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
24 and that's where the differences were
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
found mainly and then there was a little
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
bit related to the EFA efas but um yeah
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
so most of it was just chewing up the
 
02:19:39.870 --> 02:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy and that's why they have an
 
02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:41.549 align:start position:0%
adequacy and that's why they have an
open

02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation ability question any more
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
qu yes represent ORS thank you Mr chair
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so you
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
know efas was brought up I read recently
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
that efas have saved to Public Schools
 
02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
13.1 million can you either confirm or
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
give us a number or does that something
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
you look at we we haven't looked at that
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't so I I can't comment on that
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
per se okay we can just tell you how
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
much was spent out of the E the
 
02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund but I can't tell
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
you what was saved or changed as a
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
result of the local
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
expenses represent fellows so I'm I'm a
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
little bit confused about this because
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
it says um FY
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
2025 but
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
these so the first lines is that the one
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
you're pointing to that says FY 2025
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
well at the top and the bottom but these
 
02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
are these are things that have happened
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
in FY 24 so this document the one-page
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
document is the banial information so
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're saying for the 24 25 budget this
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
is where we think you're going to land
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
next June based on activity we've seen
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
through fiscal 24 so far so you were GNA
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
take look at the first line so C can I
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
just follow for example if you look at
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
the variance that that's in the
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund yep is that
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
40.8 is just what's happened in fiscal
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
year 24 so we assume fiscal 25 is going
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
to be right on plan because we don't
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
know right
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
now and they're not anticipating the
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
same change in 25 as you see here for
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
the education trust
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
fund so with the extra um four 40
 
02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
million expended this year yep you
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there that's not expected to be
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
40 million next year is the budget
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
amount for next year more than 40
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
million the education the adequacy
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
grants over a billion
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm assuming that that um a lot
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
of that EX has to do with the the
 
02:21:55.710 --> 02:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts no no it it's
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
it had to do with an adjustment the free
 
02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
it had to do with an adjustment the free
and

02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.349 align:start position:0%
 
reduced

02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
so this is you're getting into the
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and there's a hold
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
harmless in the adequacy formula so as
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
you start to get more money in your
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
Grant you may get less in the hold
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
harmless so that may offset some of that
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I would prefer that you go
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
offline and we can talk with um somebody
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
in our office about that any more
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
much one last thing you should have
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
seen a paper copy of the annual
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report and the
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
um Bond statement so it's I delivered
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
them to the office they may be in your
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
drawers or Karen may have them um and
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
and there was a question earlier about
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
the different it's the exact answer but
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
I think repon PL or repon Malloy was
 
02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking about um you know could you
 
02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
separate the types of businesses in the
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
state so on one of the pages it does
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
break out by percentage you know your
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing versus non-manufacturing
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
and it gives you a sense of um durable
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
good non- durable then you and
 
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
non-manufacturing is it construction
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale retail service Industries
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
governance Finance transportation and it
 
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
gives you percentages and then after
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
that it gives you the um largest 20
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state so so there's
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
good information in this document as
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
well as the act for when you're thinking
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
about those types of things that at
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
least get your thinking thank
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
you okay that does it for today's
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
business any questions representative
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
Aly yes we also got on state revenues
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
add to Surplus uh from uh Phil slon who
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
has had to leave already on he was um
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
for a long time an
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
auditor in the state and um he's been um
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
learning to talk to us as versus to the
 
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
numbers and I think it's worth taking a
 
02:24:12.429 --> 02:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
look at it even though he's only looking
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
at what happened in April at this
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
point thanks okay
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes just as the conversation I
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
understand before I got here you guys
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
did talk about the credit carry forward
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the percentage relative to the
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
credit carry I'm going to be repurposing
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
over in house over in Senate ways it
 
02:24:35.269 --> 02:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
means House Bill 1525 she already taken
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
care of that through Senate Bill uh 472
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that's an un it's a bill that would I
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
would normally just itl I'm going to do
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
a non-gain amendment to that and and
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
notice it and I'm going to look at
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
pushing off the next ch the next two
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
changes by I think four years and I'm
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
willing to have a conversation with you
 
02:24:57.070 --> 02:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
guys I think what is a good idea but as
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
you heard from probably Dr 50% of all
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
the refunds that were issued were a
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
direct result of the 500% forced refund
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and given what's going on with
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
revenues I'm a little nervous about the
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
idea of again forcing another change uh
 
02:25:15.389 --> 02:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
that will generate NE because all of
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
those people will get a refund plus any
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
other new people um will get another
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
refund and so um I I'm open to anybody
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
who wants to reach out and talk to me
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
about how long my my idea was I was
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
going to push to 250 off by four years
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then push the other one off by four
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
years to give us two bienniums to see
 
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on with revenues and then
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
let it take effect or not um but I'm
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to do a non during amendment to
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
1525 and repurpose that bill um for the
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
function of dealing with this push off
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the mandatory refunds and that that
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
push off is 400% right no so right now
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're at we just went to the 00% the
 
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
next step down is to 250 no I know that
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
but you're the change you're going to
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
make is going to go to 400% no the
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
change I was going to make was just
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
strictly to put the effective date of
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
the next step down out four years right
 
02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't step down to 250 for an
 
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
additional two budget Cycles so it's
 
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to stay at 500 then for it'll stay
 
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
at 500 where it is for now and then push
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
it off to push off the 250
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
implementation four years and then push
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
off the 100% implementation another four
 
02:26:21.389 --> 02:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
years so it gives us a few bienniums to
 
02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that revenues are where we
 
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
need to be before we we do this
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory like I said the the the
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we heard at least in the revenue
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
report I saw was about 50% of all the
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
refunds were issued because of the 500%
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
yeah force and so if we drop that down
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
to 200 we expect that everybody who is
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
just came underneath 500% is now going
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
to have to drop down again to 200% and
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to create a significant
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
impact in our revenue forecast so my
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
plan is to push that off a little bit
 
02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
still keep it on on to happen but let's
 
02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
give us a couple BMS before we force
 
02:26:59.309 --> 02:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
that secondary mandatory set of refunds
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
sounds good yeah representative elme
 
02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.870 align:start position:0%
sounds good yeah representative elme
yeah

02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
puts what you also missed on our
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
quizzing of uh of uh Lindsay about this
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
and uh they're feeling fairly confident
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
that the major hit
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
has happened at this point I'm not so
 
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
confident about that but I'd rather see
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
pushing off two years so that it should
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
give us enough time to see whether she's
 
02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
right why don't you two get together
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a conversation what you think the
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
ways of Means Committee wants on the
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
house side and I'd rather again I'm
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that when I present the bill
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
will'll come over with a concurrence so
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
we can be done um rather than have to go
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
through another committee conference so
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you guys get together majority
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
minority and decide where you think that
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
should be I I don't I anticipate like
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
Lindsay that next year's revenue is
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
going to be fairly flat um and because
 
02:27:57.790 --> 02:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
of that I'm nervous about forcing
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
another kick in of these of these um
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh refunds so I I think we
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
need a little bit of time to see what's
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen the year after that so
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
anyway you guys get together talk to me
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
I'm gon I'm just drafting the amendment
 
02:28:13.469 --> 02:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm going to get it in
 
02:28:15.309 --> 02:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the next day but I can amend it
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
again on the in the committee if you
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
guys come up with something different
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I had misspoken earlier on because
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
I thought we were going to 400% and then
 
02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
keeping it at
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
400% no I'm just going to push off the
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
250 and the 100% reductions a coupled by
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
enms out to give us time to see what the
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
revenue impacts are going to be okay
 
02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
just uh I'd like to say that uh pushing
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
it out makes sense to me I think
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe two B what did you say two
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles yeah four years two budget
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
yeah that may be a little much but um
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we can talk about but it I
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that I I think it
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense given the
 
02:28:59.790 --> 02:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner's uh remarks it seems that
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe the best available estimates
 
02:29:06.269 --> 02:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
which clearly are dras is that uh it's
 
02:29:08.590 --> 02:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
not going to be as severe a problem as
 
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
we might have feared but I'm glad you're
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
doing it again remember anything we do
 
02:29:16.429 --> 02:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
is only good for two years right can all
 
02:29:23.269 --> 02:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.469 --> 02:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
well Tim I'm glad you were here today I
 
02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
think you wasted all those years on
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game you should have been one
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means I was for
 
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
years I was all right I think we're all
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
