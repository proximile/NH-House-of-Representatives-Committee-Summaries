00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
well welcome to division one um first on
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
our agenda we have House Bill
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
318 relative to bail Commissioners and
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation to the judicial
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
branch this came out of Criminal Justice
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
with a vote of 20 to zero and then
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
passed on the house floor on a Voice
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
vote back on the 3 of January
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
so someone like to speak to the bill
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
anybody here that I believe
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.310 align:start position:0%
anybody here that I believe
represented

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
the good representative from Salem how
 
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.149 align:start position:0%
the good representative from Salem how
are

00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
you great thank you
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm here primarily as a resource
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
because I've been a bail commissioner
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
for 23 years and uh the reason this was
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing and I was one of them is
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
because this was a
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
truly this was really a truly bipartisan
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
effort and I did not want to honestly
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
spoil the party there are some issues I
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
have with it but I'm not I want to avoid
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
policy the house has spoken and I don't
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh talk about that especially Financial
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
impact though is something that I ask
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to think about and that's
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
this a system of magistrates was set up
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
and if you read the bill it's not very
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
carefully defined their responsibilities
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
how they interact just what they're
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
really doing
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
um the the system as
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
it uh works now can be fine-tuned
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
education requirements perhaps
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing increasing bail
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners fees in order to attract
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
more perhaps um
 
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.789 align:start position:0%
more perhaps um
uh

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
um uh getting the state to guarantee
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
some of the payments uh for some bail
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who really don't get right
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
around Rockingham County and don't get
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
paid very as often as they should should
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh but that's I'm wandering into policy
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
the part that really is costly is the B
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
the uh magistrates I think should that
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
needs real work more study just what is
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
their role what are they going to be
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
doing at a time when money may very well
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.909 align:start position:0%
doing at a time when money may very well
be

00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh may have unexpected draws on it I'm
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's warranted the only
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
tiny bit of policy I might mention is I
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we thought about this in
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee we're education requirements
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
are a wonderful idea I wholeheartedly
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
support that 16 hours for new bail
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and that's how I train
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
mine they came to me with be 2 amm and P
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
to Pelham to see what it's like to see
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
DUIs at that hour of the night morning
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh is but for established mail
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I think it should be not
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
eight hours but up to eight hours and
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
the court to decide how that agenda
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
should be filled because I don't like
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing magic about that number
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable number but uh I don't
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
see make work I want whatever time we
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
spend to be real time not
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh well we're going to count lunch as
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
part of our uh training anyway that's
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
apart from those comments I'm here if
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
there are any questions about what
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life is for a bail
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner as it reflects on this bill
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for thank you for
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
listening oh don't run away
 
00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative scitech representative
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah so uh just to about policy
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
receive in finance so our job is to make
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
sure we get value for money right so we
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
have to know what something does and and
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
how valuable it is to the state and
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
compare it to all the other you know
 
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
requests we get for money so we do
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes have to delve into policy and
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
figure that those kind of things out
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
um so as I understand it um the way
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
things work is that um someone gets
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
arrested and and when it's a serious
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
when it's not serious if it's speeding
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
or something they just get a a a summons
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the road and they go but if it's
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
something more serious um domestic
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
violence or uh DUI or something like
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
that they get brought to the police
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
station and the police call a bail
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the bail commissioner
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
comes and interviews the person and
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
decides whether or not uh that person
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
can be safely released um on bail is
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
that correct there's one element I would
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
add to that okay and that's a hand a
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
hand summons or often called a must
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
appear uh does not impose bail
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
conditions and very often there are bail
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
conditions that the police want you may
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
not go back to that store you must avoid
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
contact with this particular person uh
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the you must abstain from
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
alcohol until you see the judge that
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
that for a DUI for these are uh one of
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
the other issues that you I would like
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
to add to the list of things you said so
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
those are conditions imposed by the bail
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's correct okay and
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
since since I represent the Judiciary
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
police the police can't add conditions
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
that's right okay so and furthermore the
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
money part of it is that for the bail
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner service they're owed $40 by
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
the by the accused right that's correct
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and so because of that sometimes
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the accused doesn't have the $4 and so
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes the bail Commissioners get
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
stiffed that's true and uh that's been a
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
perennial complaint about bail
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
commissions it ranges from this is just
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
out of the Hat Manchester is five out of
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
10 10 don't get paid and Manchester has
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
I have gone from Salem to Manchester to
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
take them for the to take one for the
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
team because I believe in what I'm doing
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
and it's no fun to ride from Salem to
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester in the early hours of the
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
morning to bail somebody for nothing I I
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
but I signed up for it and I'm not not
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not not going to do it I'm from my
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
point of view Salem my area does fairly
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
well in terms of getting compensated for
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
the service but I know others from talk
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
within Rockingham County I don't believe
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
it'd be different in other counties
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
people do a lot of riding around and
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
they're losing three4 out of 10 and
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's just it's hard to retain
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's hard to feel good about what you're
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
doing right and so this bill has the
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
Judiciary pay the the money and then the
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary very later when the when the
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
accused comes to court we'll collect the
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
money from them is that that's the
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill theoretically says
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
but something that I I I don't know I I
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
don't know I want to be careful of my
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
tone here in all of our hearings on this
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
rather important bill the Judiciary was
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
not present they did not have anything
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
to say with respect to either policy or
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
mechanics of this bill now maybe they
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
were watching this on stream but I found
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
it uncomfortable that we're doing this
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
without any input now perhaps they're
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
saying they don't want it I think I see
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
a representative of the Judiciary here
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
so well okay they W they weren't they
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
were pretty invisible at the I
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
understand criminal
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.070 align:start position:0%
 
protction

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
protction
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
and okay I understand so but one last
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
thing so um
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the total number of
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners is 95 and some of
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
them aren't very active necessarily and
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill also adds
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
magistrates to kind of like be hired
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners and some sense right
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
to work weekends and and stuff like that
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me those 15 employees
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
would have a hard time going to police
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
there's enough of them to go to police
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
stations and do what bail Commissioners
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
do how how would that work in my view I
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
think the that's a low number
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
for uh so that I'm a little worried
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
about what the fiscal note says here I
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
think that's both a low number and the
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
what's more of a concern is their role
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
is not exactly defined in the bill there
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's it talks about it sets it up but
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what they're going to do
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
that bail Commissioners aren't already
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
doing and if it's to save a judge a call
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
on a Saturday that's just too bad excuse
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
me okay thank
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
you Melissa Mike do we have an updated
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
13

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
thanks uh representative scitec I served
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
as a bail commissioner under judge
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
Crocker lazat and dresser down the
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
Milford District as it was called at the
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
time now it's of course a circuit and we
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
never had any trouble getting paid
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
because we would Circ on the bottom of
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
the form that we weren't paid or we were
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
paid and when the U defense defendant
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
came before a judge if uh we hadn't been
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
paid the judge would make sure that
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
payment was issued as part of his
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
conditions or her conditions because
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
judge Crocker is a woman but is there a
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
reason that isn't done so Bill
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners don't rack up all this
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
expense or were the judges just doing
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
that out of the goodness of their heart
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
so we got paid how long ago were you a
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner about 15 years ago
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
well all right uh that's the theory
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh we do ask for it and occasionally it
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
comes through but it's very
 
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.190 align:start position:0%
comes through but it's very
occasionally

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh other further questions
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative wer thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec so you
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
show up and who set the bail is that
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
bail not set until they're in court no I
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
set the bail the bail commissioner sets
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
the bail
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
normally if we have no if we don't if
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
the subject reste is not judged to be a
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk uh then we'll just set
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance look for bail
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
conditions and verify that the police
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation we usually operate on the
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
police recommendation we will interview
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh when but normally this it's fairly
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
cut and dried uh we ask for cash now if
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
I've got somebody from Dorchester
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's doing drug that's
 
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.710 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's doing drug that's
we

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
that they have been after this person
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
for some time it's either a very high
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
cash bail if he's not actually held if
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is I'm talking about a seller of
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
drugs dealer I I know somebody that got
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
a phone call from a a nephew that you
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
need to come and bring cash and had to
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
bring a couple thousand dollars that and
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner wouldn't sign
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
anything until somebody had put some
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
actual cash down is that so that's not
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
that that's I don't know that that's
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
rare I mean it
 
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.789 align:start position:0%
rare I mean it
I

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
when once every six months I do
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
something like that that's exceedingly
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
rare uh that you actually I'm holding
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
you because and I know Uncle Louis is
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
going to come up with the money it has
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
happened but it's extremely I'm talking
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
once every six months I said so when you
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
bail them it's mainly personal recog you
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't actually see any cash most of the
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
time yeah yeah you might see the $40
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
they're e they're either held or
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
released it's rare it's become
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
increasingly unusual to ask for cash
 
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:46.549 align:start position:0%
increasingly unusual to ask for cash
thank

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
you now there is a representative from
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch here we'd like to
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
hear your comment since as
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
representative scitec said there was no
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
judicial communication during the
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
process of the bill going through
 
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.669 align:start position:0%
process of the bill going through
criminal

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
justice hello I'm Erin krian I'm the
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial branch
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we did get a chance to see these
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
drafts while they were in process I I
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe we offered testimony uh
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
but we did get a chance to review them
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
before there were committee votes I
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
think there was maybe one or two that
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
were the subject of U intense
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation right up to the vote and
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
there were some Maybe changes from the
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
last time we had seen it but we did get
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
drafts nothing else to add are you in
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill or the judicial branch
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill or well we we try
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
to refrain from taking a position
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
because given the position that we have
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
going last and applying the law we don't
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
want to step into your role which is
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
making policy decisions um we do
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we got the opportunity
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on what we could Implement
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are sometimes in a
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
policy Vision implementation challenges
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
um and we appreciate that we got the
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about what would be
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
more or less challenging for us to
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
implement um there are costs associated
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
with making some of these changes that
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
you it does represent a bold policy
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
Vision that would change some of the
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
things we currently do uh but I I as I
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
say we do appreciate that we were able
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
to give feedback on whether we could
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
implement it or not I was just glancing
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
through the new fiscal note I noticed
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
the judicial brand
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
has an estimate of about $848,000 of pay
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
the bail
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is that something you
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
propose a take out of your present
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
budget or a new appropriation it's
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
currently in statute that we have the
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
ability to pay the bail Commissioners
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't been appropriated for a
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
very long time um so we do periodically
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
get the question of how much would it be
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
if we were going to pay them and and
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's the number that um judge king
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
from the circuit court and formerly
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
judge Neto from the Superior Court had
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
come up with as is sort of a stable
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
year-to-year good estimate of how much
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
that would cost uh so it's it's
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
something that we are happy to do we
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
just currently don't have it
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated from the legislature to do
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay thanks questions uh representative
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you yeah I think wouldn't
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
it be fair to say most of that would be
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the accused I I think it
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
depends uh and I think representative
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
scitech is right that there are courts
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
where the the the number of indigent
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
defendants is very high and so some of
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners that in those
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
courts in particular that those that
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
have our highest quit rates of of bail
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because they're just not
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
being compensated frequently enough uh
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's maybe more than
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
half you'd recover but I I don't would
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
not guess that it would be
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
full and I had a zoom with u Miss krian
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and um judge Howard who's Judge NATO's
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
replacement at the head of the superior
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
court and um uh Miss uh Goram who's the
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh head administrator for the courts and
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
they all seem to like this particular
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
part of the bill they the the part
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
relating to bail Commissioners that they
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
thought that was very workable and would
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
improve the situation of bail
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it is it is certainly a
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
change that would be easy to implement
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
and it's something many of the bail
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they have asked us to do
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh we just were not appropriated to do
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
it um there was a a case Fallen be that
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
was decided while uh Kelly aot was
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
governor that um it could not be
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
required repayment of an Indigent
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
defendant or it would violate one of our
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions so I think
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
that may have there may have been more
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
stable recovery in the past before that
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
case was decided and then it was not
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation so you've already got
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
Kelly aot as a governor I I can't
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
remember Senator Governor attorney
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
general lot of hats a woman of many
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
talents but at the time she was attorney
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
general excuse me she no problem I think
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
I've I've now seen the sign that says
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
Kelly Governor enough that I say it
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
without thinking about it my apologies
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
oh not a problem further questions
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney do you have any
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
no grassy Griffin
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
wer represent
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
eil I mean I'm just not that familiar
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
with this uh this system but did many of
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are in the fiscal notes
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
come from the judicial branch yes ma'am
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
so we did a we did a comparison to one
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
of our labor grades that we would be the
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
one that a magistrate would come from
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where the estimate of the
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
cost of 15 magistrates comes from our
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
estimate of the bail commissioner fees
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
is based on our recurring count of about
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
how often bail Commissioners are
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
appearing although it is not always uh
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
very well tracked but we tracked it over
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
a few years and we think that that's an
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
accurate estimate uh we don't have a lot
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
of information about electronic
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring because it's not something we
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
currently do so we were not able to give
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
a projection there but the the numbers
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
that we've given were ones that came
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.550 align:start position:0%
from us
internally

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
internally
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
follow up and did you have input on the
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
number of magistrates that were included
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill my understanding is that
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
that number comes from a previous bill
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
from the last session where and forgive
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
me I do not know who the prime sponsor
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
was um proposed eliminating the bail
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner system and replacing them
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
entirely with magistrates and that was
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
the estimate that we had of how many
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
magistrates it would take to cover the
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
state at that time uh it it Bears
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
mentioning that the number of Bill
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners has been declining over
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
time for a relatively long period of
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
time we were stable at around 200 uh
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
before Co that had dropped to about 130
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
and now that's down to 95 and partially
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
this is that repayment becomes an issue
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
and so you have fewer people
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
volunteering uh so I my understanding
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to speak for the the
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
policy authors of the bill is that that
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a sort of gradual loss of
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
Bill Commissioners and ultimately a
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
supplantation with uh bill with
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
magistrates over time just type one more
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
more so I think you said that you did
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
have input on the
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
bill um because you wanted to make sure
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
that it was something that you could
 
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
that it was something that you could
Implement

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
Implement
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
so in the current version of the bill is
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
this something that the branch is
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with from an implementation
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint aside from the finances are
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
there things that you don't think quite
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
work uh I think overall we with the
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
right resources we can implement the
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
only thing that I think and I and I
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the authors of the bill
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
considered this is that unlike some
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
other states New Hampshire does not have
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
a pre-trial division within the courts
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
so if you go to mass or you go to the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
federal system there is judicial branch
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
staff which uh is probation officers
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
parole officers monitoring people on
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring we we just don't
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
have that in in New Hampshire it's done
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
by the counties um so I think that and
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's not done consistently some of the
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
counties do it and some don't and I
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
think that the authors of the bill
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that more common and so
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
they gave the judicial Branch the option
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
of doing it ourselves which would
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
require having some sort of pre-trial
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
division or Contracting or using private
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
services or Contracting with another
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
another government agency uh I
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that they gave us that
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility but um I think there that we
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
would have to figure out how to
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
implement it and I think the most likely
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
way would be to use the option that
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
they've given us to contract with
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
another government agency such as the
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
counties that do do electronic
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring so I think they envisioned
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
some flexibility there which we
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate um but that' probably be the
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
most challenging for just because we
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
area representative
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
chair um it seems to me that adding 15
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
magistrates is a type thing that should
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
happen on the budget
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
year uh I know this this came up
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
recently in this bill but it would seem
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
to me that this is uh particularly with
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of money involved and the
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
time of year that this is something that
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
would more properly be on your budget
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
and I wonder what your thoughts are
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
around that uh I I I would have to defer
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
to the legislature's judgment on that I
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
I understand that it there are much
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
fewer resources available to to allocate
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
year any further question
 
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.470 align:start position:0%
year any further question
thanks

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
see sweee thank you mrman thank you for
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
being here so I just want to clarify so
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
the 15 magistrate number was from a bill
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
in which there were no bail
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it was a fiscal note that
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
we completed for a bill to completely
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
replace bail Commissioners with
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
magistrates and the 15 was the number
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
needed to replace okay that's correct
 
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.109 align:start position:0%
needed to replace okay that's correct
thank

00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
you chairman Roy I saw
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
you sitting back there watching this
 
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.230 align:start position:0%
you sitting back there watching this
very

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
you um I didn't catch the all of
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
Representative sitec uh testimony I I
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
would just um I would caution that he's
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
one bail commissioner in one area we
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
heard hundreds of hours of testimony
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
from bail Commissioners across the state
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
from jails across the state from um
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
anyone from courts across the state we
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
heard from everyone so his
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
representations reflect his experience
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
and not that of the whole state
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the question on the
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
15 bail Commissioners that number was
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill however when we
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
looked at the the need for the bail
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we needed one for every
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
County so and we needed one to cover in
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
the counties when there was need for
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
vacations Etc and we were tasking them
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
with managing the bail Commissioners so
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
the number actually just worked out
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
would to be the same if the committee
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
for fiscal reasons decides to pair it
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
down I would only ask that you remember
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
we need them for every
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
County um with regard to the need for
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
them at all or whether we should wait
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
for a a budget year I would ask the
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee to remember this bill started
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
last year in the
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and came from three or four
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
different bills that came to us from the
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
house this is an urgent matter the towns
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
across the the state the cities are all
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
demanding some kind of reform with our
 
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.390 align:start position:0%
demanding some kind of reform with our
bail

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
bail
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
situation so we decided to take a
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
holistic look at it the reason the
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
magistrates are needed is because the
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
Senate wants to and we concur with some
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
very serious crimes not allow bail
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to make those decisions
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
they want a higher person they wanted
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
judges at first to do it and then the
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
courts just didn't have the staff to do
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't a matter well too bad
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
make him work on a Saturday it's a
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
matter of just there's no bandwidth to
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
do it um also back to the training and
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
supervision of the bail Commissioners no
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
one's able to do that we heard that it's
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
not happening um so it's really tough
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
with just envisioning bail Commissioners
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
carrying out the law the way that we
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
want and the way that the Senate wanted
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see in the bill there's a
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
list of crimes that a bail commissioner
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
can't decide on that's where the
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate comes in the magistrates work
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
all the weekend they work all the time
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
to cover for those certain crimes if we
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
were to take those out the whole bill
 
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.990 align:start position:0%
were to take those out the whole bill
falls

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
falls
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
apart um because then you end up with
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
these crimes and those people will be
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
end up being held at least 36 hours and
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps longer versus only 24 hours
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
until they can see someone a decision be
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
made so this bill was carefully crafted
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
so that all the stakeholders agreed did
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
anyone think it was perfect no but
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you get everyone to
 
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.710 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you get everyone to
agree

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
um I feel like we spent hundreds of
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
hours on this so to to kind of start
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
pulling the strings apart is the whole
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
thing will end up falling apart if
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's fiscal matters that need to be
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
shaved off the edges that I can
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
understand but if we're going to start
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
picking at the policy toci well do we
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
need this do we need that please
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
remember we spent an enormous amount of
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
time talking to so many people to get
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
this just what it needed to be so I
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
would take
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you I just like to
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
add when I was looking at the docket the
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
other day I saw that your committee
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
alone met I don't know countless times
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah hundreds of hours yeah represent
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
so um how do you see the magistrates
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
working are they going to travel to the
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
police stations and deal with these
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
cases or are they going to do it over
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
Zoom or phone or something like that or
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to micromanage the court
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
on how they did that some cases they may
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
have to travel just out of uh necessity
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
because there's nowhere to do a zoom
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
type of situation sometimes they may be
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
able to do that um it it's really up to
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the courts so that the
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
person gets their due Pro their due
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
process rights um so if doing it over
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
Zoom allows that great if it doesn't
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
then they're going to have to go in
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
person so I can't I wouldn't be able to
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
tell you in all honesty how it will work
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
exactly each case it'll be dependent on
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
the case in in my opinion keeping in
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
mind they're going to have to travel
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
most of the time I think because to get
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
the record the person's criminal record
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
they actually have to get it in their
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
hand because you can't transmit it
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
legally over facts or something like
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's very complicated as
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
far as looking at that person's criminal
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
history record and unless they're in a
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
place where they can pull it themselves
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
they'll have to
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
go if they're at home for example they
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
can't get a criminal record so they're
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to have to go at least to
 
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.270 align:start position:0%
going to have to have to go at least to
a

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
courthouse I see um can I may yeah so I
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
know that uh the J the Judiciary told me
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
that when a bail commissioner is not
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
available there are a handful of bail
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who do their work over the
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
phone right and so if they're not in
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
person it seems to me that's not as good
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
right I mean a bail commissioner in
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
person wouldn't that be superior to a
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
magistrate over the phone or over Zoom
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
or something like I would say that they
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
would work the same um so if a if a
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
magistrate if a commissioner can do it
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
over the phone so can a magistrate if
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
they don't they can't again that's up to
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
the court if it was up to me I'd say
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely they should all go every time
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
but I I really can't tell them how to
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
how to run their business I can just
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
tell them this is the policy want you we
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
want you to enforce okay um but yeah
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely it be better a person but to
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
your point of well would it be better
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
with a just bail Commissioners because
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
because they can go so can the
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
magistrate and remember we're only
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a limited number of crimes
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
that the bail Commissioners wouldn't be
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
handling anyway it's the most serious
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
crimes that those magistrates and the
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
magistrates have to work all weekend um
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony from many people
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the jails where people sat
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes for a couple days because the
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner just didn't show up
 
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any they called all the
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
ones they had and that was it so it's
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
not like there's one person that they
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
can always call and they'll be on Zoom
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
one more thank you so I spoke to uh
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
judge Howard specifically about this
 
00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.870 align:start position:0%
judge Howard specifically about this
question

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
of is there any sense that the bail
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are making poor decisions
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
about who should be bailed and who
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and so on and he said no he
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
said he didn't think you know he said
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
maybe some more training would be useful
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
but but there isn't there there isn't
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
seemingly a crying need uh for a
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
professional to do something that the
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners do now um did you
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
hear other cases are there sort of
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
horror stories about this bail
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner did something wrong and Etc
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
yeah actually there were um we heard one
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh a very recent case where someone was
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
arrested for um for let me see he he
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
beat up his wife um I believe he
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
urinated on her uh she was horrifically
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
beaten up and the bail commissioner let
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
him go on personal recognizance I mean
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
it's just it's there needs to be a
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
higher level and I understand um I
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
understand the policy issue of the judge
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind this bill doesn't just
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
handle the judicial system it handles
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System all these other
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
players are involved so the judge might
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of it but it's not the
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
Court's bill it's the it's the whole
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
systems bill um and they didn't seem to
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
voice that concern when we talked to
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
them and I met with the Chief Justice
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
judges any further questions for the
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes represent you will thank
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
you for coming and really thank you so
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
much for all the work that you and the
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
Committees it's just phenomenal um so
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
from the magistrate standpoint you said
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
that you know we could consider shaving
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
here and there you think at a bare
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
minimum there should be at least one
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
magistrate Per County yes and if if if
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
it gets to one magistrate Per County and
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a magistrate IM medication a
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
judge is just going to have to pick up
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
the slack um because the law will still
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
stipulate that the people that are
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
arrested for these crimes have to be
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
seen by a judge or or a magistrate so I
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
I would say the bare minimum would be
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
and if you decide in your wisdom that
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's the the financial best financial
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
way to go and they need more they can
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
come back and ask for them in the budget
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
year and their appropriation um but as
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
far as the the emergent nature of this
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill I would say the the 10 one per
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
County would be good well just follow I
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
I remember when you were here before you
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
said that um the 15 number was an
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
attempt to have backup for magistrates
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
who were not um available yes and and
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
again I want to emphasize um there the
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates are are are available to the
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
courts for more than just what's in this
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill they're available to the courts to
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
carry Min ministerial hearings that will
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
free up judges there are certain
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
hearings that a magistrate can conduct
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
um in the courthouse that will free the
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
judge to do other things on the docket
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
so they're they're multifaceted we're
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
not just hiring people to to work a
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
couple hours on a Saturday night they
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be full-time employees of
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
the court and they plan to put them into
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
into use can miss one more question sure
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
do you do you feel that the decrease in
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
the number of bail Commissioners has to
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
do with the amount of compensation they
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
getting I think it's it's multifold I
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
think it's um number one the the lack of
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
any compensation that many of them get a
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
large percentage it's the amount of
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
money um we don't give them any any gas
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
mileage any anything they just get this
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
fee and some of them drive a long way
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
and the gas prices as we know have gone
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
through the roof so we we talked about
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
well should we put in a mileage and it
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
became complicated and hard to manage so
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
we said well you know what let's just
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
bump the bump the I think we bumped at
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
$10 or to 50 and that should help them
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
with the increase in gas um so as long
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
as they're getting paid every time I
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
think that will help another complaint
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
we heard is unresponsiveness from the
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
courts um no training the training that
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
they got was you know sometimes you got
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
it sometimes you didn't it sometimes it
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
was great sometimes it wasn't it wasn't
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
very very standardized um so that was
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
their number one complaint was training
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
and feeling like they weren't just out
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
there in a kind of in the wild
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
west thank you and they were they were
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
getting when anything goes wrong all
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
fingers pointed at them and they're like
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
well we can only do what you give us to
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
do and tell us to
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
do representative McGuire has one more
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
question sure absolutely so on numbers I
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
have in mind that that there are 5,000
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
arrests in New Hampshire
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
a year that require a bail commissioner
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's correct or nor do
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
I but we can go with that all right do
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know how many are in this um these
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
crimes that are being
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
excluded uh that would require a judge
 
00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:45.230 align:start position:0%
excluded uh that would require a judge
or

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate I'll be honest we did at one
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
point I I don't have that number in my
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
head anymore if if you're taking a vote
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
today I can't help you but if if you if
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
you have some time I could pull that
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
number thank um but we did have Miss Gan
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
knows the answer she may but I hate to
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
put her on a spot
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
um do you do believe the new um crimes
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
were it it was around 6,000 based on
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
2021 numbers but that was a high pror
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
year so it could be a little bit lower
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
and how many are do you know that
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a list of serious crimes that
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's the list of all cases
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
brought that were those serious crimes
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have a good number of how many
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
cases involved a bill commissioner
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to track that
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
specifically but 6,000 is all uh is the
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
number of initiated cases involving one
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
of the enumerated crimes so 6,000 isn't
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
the total arrest in Hampshire it's the
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
number of those those crimes these
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
crimes that are being excluded from bail
 
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.030 align:start position:0%
crimes that are being excluded from bail
commission

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
yes that that seems like way too many no
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
look at the crimes all right I mean
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
every one of them's a a serious um
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
bodily injury felony um
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
and and again that's that's a policy
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
compromise with the Senate the Senate
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
wanted um the felony version I mean the
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor versions of those crimes we
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
should no only the felony versions so
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's we compromised already on that
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
number all right thank you
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
questions sing thank you thank you
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you members of the
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.430 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you members of the
committee

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
concerning House Bill
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
318 seeing none will at least close the
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
work session for now as far as accepting
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
any more testimony but representative
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
Maguire I believe has an amendment that
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill so chairman Roy you might want to
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
once everybody gets a copy we'll have
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
um so what I asked for and I hope I
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
got is
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.359 --> 00:56:29.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
see make certain changes yeah so what I
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
asked for is I it seemed to me that that
 
00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:39.109 align:start position:0%
asked for is I it seemed to me that that
the

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
magistrates is to is intended to be a
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
kind of hired bail commissioner right
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who's working for the state but
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
doing the same function as the bail
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner and of the people that I
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to none said the bail
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are doing a bad job they
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
all said we don't have enough of them
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
right and so the key to me the key part
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
of the bill was let's pay them more and
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
make sure they get paid right so pay
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
them the
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
$50 and get them paid from the Judiciary
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
not the um uh not you know willy-nilly
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
from the from the defendant and then
 
00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:23.190 align:start position:0%
from the from the defendant and then
secondly

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
um secondly
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh get them the training part right keep
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
the training part to get them a little
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
better trained and so hopefully those
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
changes would get the the decline in
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners to be an
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase um and and so we could see how
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
that works right uh prior to hiring the
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
magistrates right so um so let's not do
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
everything all at once here but let's
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
try can we strengthen the the bail
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner system first and then if
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
work um we can talk about the
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
magistrates later but it just seems to
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
me that the that the magistrate idea
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
isn't all that workable because the work
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of the bail
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is in the police station
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
right they have to travel they have to
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
go to the police station they need to
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
meet the people and so
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
you know one for Hillsboro County you
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
know two for Hillsboro County I mean how
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
is that going to work so so you know I I
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate um chairman Roy's position
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
but it just seems to me we need more
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to start with and and not
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
and and let's slow down on the big
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
spending item which is the magistrate so
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I asked for I I'm reading
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
and and maybe we should wait until we
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
see more of those specific numbers
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
because I I I can't believe there's
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
6,000 that would be a 100 a week of
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
these serious serious crimes right I
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't make sense right
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
data our share of
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
what yeah
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
right anyway uh um we won't act on this
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
today so anyone out there that had some
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
heartburn um we won't act on this today
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
we have a few weeks ahead of us and so
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
we won't make a decision and I I believe
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire may need some
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
additional numbers yes to support his
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment so let's do that that's a good
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
ide that being said everyone okay with
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that all right so thanks for attending
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh nice to see chairman Roy and
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
close so the next uh Bill we have is
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
training yes Mr chairman would you like
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
to take a seat I am pinch hitting all
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
Finance I chair the special committee on
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of Circuit Court of
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
which representative katab the prime
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor was a most valuable member and
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
chaired the subcommittee on judicial
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
training I'm pinch hitting at the last
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
minute because she's tied up in
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
judiciary where she is the clerk we had
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
14 hours of testimony from the public
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
most members of which complained about
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
the process of how their family court
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
trials were conducted and turned out and
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
we sifted through a lot of that to find
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
some actionable information and came up
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
with several things that we thought uh
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
would be good changes in the uh judicial
 
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
system as the chairman of this from the
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
beginning I took the attitude I wanted
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and this special committee
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
to gang up together against problems and
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
not gang up against each other which too
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.910 align:start position:0%
not gang up against each other which too
often

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
happens the special committee concluded
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
that one of the areas the process could
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
be improved is in having greater
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
training initial and ongoing for
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
judges uh conversations both in
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee and privately especially
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
privately indicated that some of the
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
judges believed this would be a good
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
idea to give you a hypothetical a judge
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
assigned to the family court
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
retires the governor nominates to the
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
executive Council a wonderful lawyer
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
renowned for diligence and
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
integrity the problem is all of her
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
legal career she has been a patent
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
attorney and as of next Monday she's
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
going to be in family court and while
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
she is a quick study and does her
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
homework um you can finish that thought
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
she's never had a divorce or child
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
custody case either personally or
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
professionally she's never appeared
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
before the Family Division of the
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court as a lawyer or a litigant
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
or a person
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
involved so our special committee came
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
to believe a greater amount of initial
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
and continuing education would be in
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
order one might raise the question that
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
the word shall is used in an instance
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
most of the time it says may in other
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
words we're saying this would be a good
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
idea we think but there is the question
 
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
of uh we are the legislature and they
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
are the Judiciary and there's certain
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
things they don't do in our playground
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
and vice
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
versa retired chief justice Bob Linn
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
presently chairman of the Judiciary said
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
that he saw no problem where the word
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
shell was used that it would be a
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue so this is just to
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
make our judges better trained initially
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
and given more continuing education
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
along the
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
way so just a little history for the
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
division uh this passed out of the
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee 18 to1 and on the
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
house floor on the February 1st it was a
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote to pass so
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
questions you must have done a good job
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
well it's a good team it's a great
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
committee thank you uh thank you
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary certainly thank you again for
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
the record Aon crean general counsel for
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch um we appreciated
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with the special
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division um a
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
lot of very interested perceptive and in
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
a deep dive on what was going on in
 
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
Family Court we had legislators come and
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
and sit through entire days uh of of the
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
Court's docket and I think they they
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
came to appreciate a lot and they had
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
some very perceptive
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
observations uh I think the the
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion to have a Judicial training
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
coordinator is one of those very
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
perceptive observations for for the
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch this is a collateral
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
Duty for many of the people who engage
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
in training uh there's potentially a
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
cost-saving to having a person go and
 
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
find free trainers which many people are
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
potentially willing to do but right now
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
if someone's doing that as just a side
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
duty of their job they they're not
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily able to give the same amount
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
of time and resource to it um I think
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
the suggestion is an excellent one we
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
nowh it's a suggestion being made
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget cycle um if for
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
some reason it was not brought forward
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
now we would bring that suggestion again
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
because it is a very good one uh and we
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
would absolutely use this resource um so
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate that suggestion um I I
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
put myself in Peril in the Judiciary
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
Committee disagreeing with former Chief
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
Justice and chairman of the house
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee Bob Lynn who's in
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
addition to those things a very good
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer um that there is a substantial
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
amount of case law that currently exists
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
that does suggest that having the
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory sh would be unconstitutional I
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
understand that he has a a different
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
perception of that but the way that this
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
typically comes up is if someone Sues
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
and that turns out to be correct we're
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to enforce the law
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
if it's changed to a May and someone
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
sues the independent action of the
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary will be enough to save the
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion so this happened for example
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill 130 from the last session
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
they put in a May instead of a sha so
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
that the Chief Justice could execute on
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature's suggestion and there
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
would not be a li challenge that would
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
be successful that their requirement was
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh that's the way it
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
typically comes up is a third party
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
brings a suit and then we're not able to
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
um enforce the legislator's suggestion
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
so I I did not raise that issue to to
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
challenge the legislator's power which
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
is vast when it comes to judicial
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
matters but to just to insulate um the
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
policy suggestion from a
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuit would you take questions of
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
course representative Maguire yeah this
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
is more in the nature of a statement but
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you as part this shet
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and that you know we shouldn't
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
interfere with the judges um internal
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
stuff but I really wish the Judiciary
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
would give us the same courtesy and not
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
interfere with
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
our prerogatives right which they do all
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
the time so I I have an amendment on
 
01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
the time so I I have an amendment on
this

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill well the amendment is being passed
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
out representative evil has a
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
question um so do you think that the
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
initial training for judges let me put
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
it the other way do you think the
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
continuing education for judges is as
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
important a piece as the initial
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
training yes ma'am I
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
do and do you think that the hours that
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
have put in here are put in here make
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
sense are they high low my understanding
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
is that this comes I just taking the
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
representatives testimony the prime
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor testimony um from from another
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
state we train people well over these
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
numbers um so they would not change the
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
amount of training that we would be
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing it would in fact be well below
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
what we currently do how how important
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
do you think it is to even have numbers
 
01:08:16.199 --> 01:08:17.309 align:start position:0%
do you think it is to even have numbers
in

01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
here because we're going to exceed these
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
numbers by a significant factor I would
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
not consider them to be very helpful
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
unless you wanted to enforce against
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
someone let's say a clerk of court is
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
required to do 12 hours that they um you
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to ring them up on an employment
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
issue and say you were you did not
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
comply with a requirement of your job um
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's the scenario in which I would
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
most likely see it come up but it would
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
not it would not affect for us how much
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
training people
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
receive and how did how were the numbers
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
gotten maybe that's not a question for
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
you my understanding from the prime
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
sponsors testimony and support of it in
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
committee was that she had seen them in
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
another state but I could be
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
misapprehend what she
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
said okay so there no no no I don't well
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
I was going to say they're somewhat
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary so they're not but that's
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
probably too harsh uh 12 hours of C is a
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
a common requirement in most
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions for attorneys so I think
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
the intention either in that state or
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
for this Prime sponsor was to have twice
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
as much for a judge which may seem like
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
um a lot and I and it it is a lot I
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
think for attorney to to meet that in a
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
typical year um but for the judges they
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
typically receive much more thank
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
much are there any further questions or
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
from folks out there now I believe
 
01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
you've received a copy of Representative
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire's Amendment representative
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire would you like to explain so um
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
the key expense in this bill is hiring
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
of a Judicial training
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator um so I thought it better to
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
align that with the budget year so this
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
moves the effective date to July 1st
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
2025 um and the the uh related to the
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative eel was talking
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
this also I I don't believe in in sort
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
of micromanaging what the what the
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is doing so this cut out most
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
of those numbers and left it up to them
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
except for the initial training of
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
Judges which is the example that most
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
people use like the one we heard today
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's what the
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
amendment does it gives them more
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility but it says it does it moves
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
cycle do you would you like to comment
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
or do you have any
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
or do you have any
yeah

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I enjoyed ever so
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
much working with the Judiciary in the
 
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.110 align:start position:0%
much working with the Judiciary in the
special

01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee is how collaborative both they
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the committee saw this job to
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
be to the point where when one of the
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittees met that was going to
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
bring forward some
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
suggestions the Judiciary before the
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions were made informed the
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee how they were already
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
implementing them because they had been
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
talking with us individually they had
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
been either in attendance or monitoring
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
our committee meetings we are out um out
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
eyes they are in eyes and we saw that as
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
meshing rather than as
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
antagonistic so I have full confidence
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
that the Judiciary will increase the the
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
amount of training that is done
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
initially and
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
subsequently um again it's been a joy to
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
chare this special committee because
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
they wanted to work with us and we
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to work with
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
answer nobody would ever accuse you of
 
01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.750 align:start position:0%
answer nobody would ever accuse you of
being

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
liberal in the classic definition of
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
liberal they
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
should anyway there any questions for
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
the chair of Health un
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
Services seeing none oh one more
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
represent MCU not not a question but one
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
more point that I the other reason for
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
taking out the numbers was it occurred
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
to me that the amount of training that a
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
20-year judge versus a two-year judge
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
needs is quite probably quite different
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
and but the bill as written says this
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
many hours for everybody right so I
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
thought I'd just take some of that out
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah sure well as a lawyer who is no
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
longer practicing just from the
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the continuing education
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
requirements I agree with you and
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they make sense in the early
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
years but after you've been around a
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
while they make a little less sense so
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
but you did decide to leave the Sha in
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
here yeah I didn't focus
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
on okay thank
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.430 align:start position:0%
on okay thank
you

01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the division would we
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on representative
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%

questions

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
comments yes I I I have a I like the
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment a lot I just still wonder
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
about the shell
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
part represent McGuire you'll take the
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
shell out right if if that's what people
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
want that's fine with you want to change
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
that to
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
may7 if the if the Judiciary has a TR
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
trouble with it seems like that makes
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
yes can you state your name for the
 
01:14:27.239 --> 01:14:28.590 align:start position:0%
yes can you state your name for the
record

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
pleas hi I'm representative Caitlyn cab
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
apologize that I'm late we were
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
executing a bill down the hall I just
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to state that this bill did
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
initially say may however our retired
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
chief justice Bob Lyn felt that it was
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
not a 73a issue to say shell and to
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
require the training and so it was
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
amended to say shell in judiciary
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.910 align:start position:0%
amended to say shell in judiciary
intentionally

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
we actually heard by the representative
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch that may would
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate versus shell no just
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
respect to the former Chief Justice and
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
she she did raise that issue in our
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee as well and he respectfully
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
disagreed and changed it to
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
May so do we
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
care our he kind of felt as as though
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know we mandate training all the
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
time in other branches as well even in
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the executive branch so there's no
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
reason why we can't do it here was his
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
argument back
 
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
so well here from representative eel and
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
then our former judge hwit over here as
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
far as the mayor shell before we act on
 
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
far as the mayor shell before we act on
the

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I I you know with all due
 
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
respect to um representative Lynn I
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
guess it just really gives me some pause
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
when we have the general Council of the
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
judicial branch sitting here saying that
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
they do have constitutional issues and
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
that they will be the ones that would be
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
forced to um enforce the statute so um I
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't know it's up to the committee I'd
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
prefer to see May representa huitt is a
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
former judge and
 
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer you like to comment don't forget
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
to push your
 
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.270 align:start position:0%
to push your
mic

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
mic
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
Point um it isn't just the business of
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
shall and may if you read the if you
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
read the first
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph I want to I don't want to
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
be cruded but they it almost appears
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
that they're selling
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
something now you're talking about uh
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
high quality judicial branch training
 
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
high quality judicial branch training
and

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh providing judges administrators and
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
Court staff with a reasonable
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fulfill any mandatory
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
orientation and initial required
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
training that that pretty much creates
 
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
training that that pretty much creates
a

01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
a kind of a box to put everything in and
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me that what you have
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
is a a series of different kind times of
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
different kinds of employees that you're
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh you're dealing with judges who have
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
been on the bench for a short time and a
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
long time uh the same the same is true
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
with some of the Court
 
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
staff so that to just put a a blanket
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
out there I think is a little bit a
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
like sales sales pitch or something uh
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
now and of course there is judicial
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
training is a lot different from every
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
every other kind and in some cases you
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
know the 73a situation I can
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
apply but this just that sentence just
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
strikes me as being something that goes
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit over the edge as far as
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
trying to create a program that's going
 
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
to be successful and I don't think you
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
need I don't I don't think you need to
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
dictate to judges and and uh uh Court
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
staff U what what a a reasonable what a
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable workload is or what what kind
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the things need to be done in in
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
point of fact uh a lot of this a lot of
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
this stuff is difficult to uh to
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
imagine and it's even worse in the in
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the field of uh
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
bail where the work is all done out in
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
the field but I I I agree that there can
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
be a a
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
training program
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
developed separate and apart from what
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
is normally part of the judicial
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
training uh concept which practically
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
practically every judge goes through at
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
one time or another and uh so I I think
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
that that that sentence could use a
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
work we can talk about that represented
 
01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
Griffin remember we do have a motion on
 
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.629 align:start position:0%
Griffin remember we do have a motion on
the

01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
floor yeah I
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
um I had more trouble with the shell
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
under the original Law than I do with
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
the shell under the amendment because
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
basically the amendment doesn't dictate
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
the number of hours or anything else it
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
just says there will be training so I I
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
really have no problem with this shell
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
as it's written in the amendment as it
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
does just deal with training versus some
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
legal matter it's training versus a
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
legal matter okay representative evil
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would like to ask uh the
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative from the judicial branch
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
if she has a different feeling on the
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment than the original bill which
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
goes in part to what representative
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me um I think the the prime
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor when she had originally done
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
this had tried to mitigate the sh I
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
should not try to speak for her but by
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
adding as directed by the Chief Justice
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
of the Supreme Court to that sentence so
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
that it could for example if it needed
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
to be an extreme labor shortage or
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
something to that effect it could be
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
waved it could be moved that there was
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
an element of judicial internal
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
management that was still considered in
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
the structure of that sentence um so I I
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't believe that when I had reviewed
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
her draft I changed that shell there uh
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
I think I had left that because she had
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
left an out that the Supreme Court could
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh through the Chief Justice could
 
01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:14.510 align:start position:0%
uh through the Chief Justice could
direct

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise yeah I'm happy to have the
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
vote and then if it's uh you
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
know if if there're serious problems we
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
can do something all right the motion
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.629 align:start position:0%
 
significant

01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
would Aid in assuring governing bodies
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
are appropriately funds that delivered
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers and reducing Services
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
needed for those homeless youth entering
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
their adult stages uh two years ago uh
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester received a letter
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh from the governor saying that uh the
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
state had appropriated to Manchester $44
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
million in the last four years for
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh it wasn't to the city of
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester it was to the
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofits uh and also uh my part-time
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
job as an alderman in Manchester I've
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
noticed in the last two years that uh
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
homeless the homeless population is
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
getting younger uh 19 year olds 20 year
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
olds um and also I get a lot of calls
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
from the uh School District uh on uh
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
children that are sleeping in cars or or
 
01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
they're not in encampments thank god um
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
we Manchester had appropriated money to
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
immediately remove any child and parent
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
from an
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
encampment um and I know uh the city of
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester in the last two years has
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
spent from their General funds $5.5
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
million towards towards homelessness and
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
I just think that if we could catch it
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
at the early stages we may be able to
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
help prevent uh adult
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness um that's why I um agreed
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
with this uh this uh scenario uh of of
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh the officer child advocate um looking
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
at youth homelessness I know in
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester we don't have a complete
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
circle on youth homelessness there's
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
little patches here and there and I find
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the same in the state of Hampshire
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
so I think this would help in in getting
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
our arms around uh youth homelessness
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
within within the
 
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.229 align:start position:0%
within within the
state

01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike do we have an updated fiscal
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
not this is kind of old but maybe it
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed it's
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
1127 this bill came through as
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
introduced so it hasn't needed to change
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
the bill hasn't been amended thanks
 
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.229 align:start position:0%
the bill hasn't been amended thanks
you're

01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
welcome questions for the good
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester you don't have enough
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
Maguire all I don't and um I don't think
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
I voted for this bill but
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so exactly what will this person do
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
to to um to help homelessness that's not
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of the already millions of dollars
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
you talked about uh this is uh thank you
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative this
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is spefic specifically for youth
 
01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
homelessness we have um Continuum of
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
cares uh throughout the state in
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
different regions that um address
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh it's adult homelessness
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
and I think a concentration on youth
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh would would help this
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
help the state really yeah but
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
specifically what will the person do
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
will they go out and look for Youth and
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
cars will they you know what are they
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
going to do yeah they're going to
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
looking for nonprofits or for-profits
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
that identify uh that work with youth
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
there is no I mean for 10 years I I've
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
been looking at um the silos in these
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
different uh there's no complete circle
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
in anything we attempt to do in the city
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
of Manchester it's it's all silos
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
everybody every nonprofit's got their
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
own gig and they want their own money
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
for that gig and they don't work with
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
the other uh nonprofits in in Manchester
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're forcing them you don't get any
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
money from us unless you collaborate
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
with the other nonprofits that are on
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
your same issue and that I would hope
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be one of the things
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
that they'd be looking at is identify
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
who's working with youth
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness what are the gaps how can
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
we complete that Circle by getting all
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
those entities
 
01:30:14.119 --> 01:30:18.310 align:start position:0%
those entities
together

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
no and if I may uh uh Mr chairman I I
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not I heard there was a problem
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the motion to
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
table um but I've never been able to
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
identify what the problem
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
was all right well thanks for your
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and I see some folks out there
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably from the child
 
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.510 align:start position:0%
probably from the child
advocacy

01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
group believe we received a
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
folks and just State your your name for
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
the record
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
together good morning chair Lan and
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee um I don't think I've gotten
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to all of you before I am Lisa
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
masio I am the attorney at the office of
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
child advocate so I'm essentially the
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
deputy to the child advocate candra
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
Sanchez who is unable to be here today
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
as well as do the policy and legislative
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
work um the office of child advocate is
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
a state agency but we are an independent
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
oversight agency so we are not in any of
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
those silos we are not part of
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS or the Department of Education
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
although we do have oversight over those
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
agencies we're actually administratively
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
attached to
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
das um so we did give some um testimony
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
but I would be happy to answer
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's specific
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
question about how this would actually
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
work if that would be
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
helpful we are not going to just walk
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
around peeking in cars to see if there
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
are children in there um although maybe
 
01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
we will but probably not um so generally
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
the way our office works is under our
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute which is 21v um we are an
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
independent agency and completely
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
confidential so we take calls from
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
anyone in the state it could be judges
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
or attorneys it could be social workers
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
it could be Folks at school parents
 
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
directly from children um we have a
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
number of different ways to outreach us
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
we've actually just started a text line
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
specifically for children so currently
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
we take calls and are looking only
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
though at system involved children so
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
right now our intakes can only be for
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
children that are currently system
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
involved whether it's with dcyf the
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
child protection side Juvenile Justice
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
it could involve the schools it could
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
involve any of the res residential
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
facilities um what this and so then when
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
we get a call we look into it what is
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
going on depending who called we can see
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
into dcf's Bridges see what's going on
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
with the case we can connect all those
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
silos that's really our primary one of
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
our primary jobs that is what makes our
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
agency appropriate for this position and
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
makes us sort of unique we can call a
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and call in dcyf the school the
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
attorney doe the teachers the providers
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
bring everyone to the same table and
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going on for that
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
particular child what this bill would do
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
would be to allow us to interact with
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
children who are not currently system
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
involved because there is a big gap
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
there as representative long stated that
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of Youth homelessness may not be
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
system involved yet there are a number
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
of children still in their intact
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
families which is great but that are
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
struggling Ling with homelessness or
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
very unstable housing those kids
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
currently we do not have access to under
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
our current statute so that's one of um
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
really the Boon of this bill and why it
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to put it into our
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
independent agency to be able to contact
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
those children so that may be calls from
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
schools the mckin vento lays on it may
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
be calls from Neighbors from concerned
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
daycare providers um right now if we get
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
a call like and the child is not system
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
involved we have to refer them elsewhere
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
and as representative long stated
 
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's not really a very connected
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
network of how to help that child and
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
that family without forcing them into
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
Child Protection involvement so but
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we will go around and look in cars
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
if that works and let me let Emily
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
introduce herself as well no I should
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
know this but are you administratively
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
attached to another state agency Das the
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services so
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
we are independent but we do um
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
essentially just for human resources and
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
and sort of business accounting they
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't oversee us Cassandra Sanchez is
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
the head of our agency representative
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you so how many such calls
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
where do you get where someone would
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
fall into this category but you you're
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
forced to say go talk to somebody else I
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
wish I could answer that question but
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our data collection system
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
which we are trying to fix right now is
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
not doesn't really allow us to track
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
that if we get a call that we don't have
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
oversight over we don't have a code for
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
that it's basically just we refer out I
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you though that in the last
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
year we've had calls for 142 missing
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
children that were dcyf involved so we
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
can take jurisdiction over those kids I
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
think the flips as well as some pretty
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
nine since January of serious concerns
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
of human sex trafficking for children
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
that are system involved so again that's
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
that tiny percentage that our system
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
involves so presumably and I think
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
Waypoint can give you some better
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
data if this position were to be created
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
in our office and folks knew that we
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
could now handle these calls we expect
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
there to be a flood of calls from our
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
Network that already knows what we do
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
from all those teachers counselors
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
daycare providers you know law
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement that now know oh there's an
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
extra thing we can call the OCA about
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they're going to give us that same
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
lens and that same resources as we
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
currently have for system involved so I
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
wish I had a better number but I think
 
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
Waypoint has sort of a a global idea of
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
how many of those kids are out there and
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
and if you got such a call who would you
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
send them to it is very case specific so
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
even our current cases is you know we
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
have an intake process with a pretty
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
thorough you know sort of initial
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
interview of what exactly is going on
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
who are you already involved and where
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
do you live you know are you connected
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
to a school of other resources so we
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
would then work with all of those folks
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
around that particular family but in
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
doing that work we then also see the
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
gaps in the system Statewide because we
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
get calls across the state no that's not
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
what I meant I'm sorry you when you
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
can't help somebody because they're not
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
system involved right you say well I'm
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't help you because and you
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
say please you know go call HHS or
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
somebody right so that I'm not a social
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
worker so I don't actually take the
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
intake calls but I can tell you
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
generally um we would refer them to
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
community providers like Waypoint if we
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
know they have Sheltering needs or
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
wherever they are in the state
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
um we could refer to some DHHS Services
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
typically we're not encouraging folks to
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
get involved with like Child Protection
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
if that's not it just it really depends
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
on but that is also how we identify
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
those gaps we realize there is no one to
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
send them to and that's where sometimes
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
we bring forward new policies we talk
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the providers we bring forward
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
legislation to fill those needs all
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
right one last question so if if a child
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
is homeless wouldn't it be appropriate
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
that they become in foster care no no
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
the statute actually very explicitly
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
says that cannot remove a child from
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
their family based on financial issues
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
and homelessness often falls into that
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
that the parent is meeting the child's
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
basic needs they're clothed they're fed
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
they're getting to school they're
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
getting medical care so homelessness
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
alone is absolutely not a reason to call
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf or to remove a child because
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
removing a child from their family is
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
actually very
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
traumatic all right but then then the
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
family would be getting homelessness
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
help right so that's not necessarily
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
what the DCF system is set up for is to
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
DCF but I mean in general that's not
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
a the way I I understand this and maybe
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong is that these are not kids in
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
families are they or are they they they
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
may be kids in families yes I think one
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the other advantages of this bill so
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
our office is able to service youth up
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
to age 21 or 22 currently if their
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
system involved and it's voluntary above
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
18 um so it is that transition period as
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
well though that's really challenging
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
for kids to successfully launch into
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
adulthood when when they're struggling
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
with this particular issue and as
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
representative long said there is a gap
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank are there any further questions oh
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
would you like I'll just introduce
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
myself I'm Emily Lawrence the deputy
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy director with Waypoint um and I
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
have testimony here as well that I
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
emailed the committee and my colleague
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
Aaron George Kelly who runs Our Youth
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
Services Program which includes Our
 
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
Youth and Young Adult homelessness
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
programs um uh also emailed you
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
testimony those programs include Street
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
Outreach programs so we do have people
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
that go out onto the streets um to look
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
for homeless Youth and Young adults uh
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
they also include drop in Cent so that
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
they can come do their laundry get some
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
food do their homework if they need to
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
or look for a job um and then we have
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
the shelter in Manchester which was just
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
opened in 2020 the fall of 2022 which is
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
really the only overnight shelter in New
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for that age range of 18 to
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
25 um and what we've learned is that
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that age range not only is critical to
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
prevention but is is tricky because they
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
often don't feel comfortable going to an
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
adult homeless shelter um there's still
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
some of them are transitioning out of
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
foster care or other services and so
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
that's there's often a a kind of a drop
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
at that point where they are at high
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
risk of becoming homeless um our shelter
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
does not just provide shelter we
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
actually provide case management for
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
them so we would help them to be looking
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
for a job to figure out who their
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
supports could be and their resources um
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a wraparound care that we
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
have for them then we also have
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
Transitional Living Program and that is
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
again for that young adult age group um
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
as they're looking to get on their feet
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
to get a job to figure out how they can
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
get a car and get around um we have
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
housing are there any
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
you I did have a question for
 
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
you I did have a question for
representative

01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:42:03.629 align:start position:0%
representative
long

01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
so on the most recent fiscal note that
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
we received it shows an appropriation of
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
$150,000 but nothing for 26 and 27 was
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
it the intent maybe that that would be
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
funded in the budget next time around
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
see nodding heads so yeah I I was hoping
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
it would deliver what we're hoping it
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
would deliver and then be included in
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
thanks all right any uh it's up to the
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the division what they'd
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
like to do it's a
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
$150,000 yes
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
sir sure you got a few
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
minutes and your name for the record
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
please hi uh Keith kenning I'm the Avis
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
director at Waypoint Emily is my
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
colleague just I just want to say that
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
um there is no doubt there's a quiet
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
crisis going on here on homelessness
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
with kids um I was just down at our
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
shelter down in Manchester we have 14
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
beds down there and every night we have
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
to do a lottery and we turn around 15
 
01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
kids away every night and this is just
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
18 to 25 year olds we don't even touch
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
the 13 to 18 year olds because of the
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
Leal complications when we were asked
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
how many more beds we would need just in
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester to deal with the 13 to 25
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
year olds the answer was probably 20
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
more so every night we turn children
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
away the question was what about in
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
Rochester we probably need 10 or 15 beds
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with the homeless kids there um
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
it is everywhere it is growing I had a
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
friend one time say to me some issues
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
are like trying to shovel fog this is
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
one of those issues it's difficult to
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
know exactly what's going on because the
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
kids are fleeing they're either fleeing
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know Anger from their parents or
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
something's going on they're sofa
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
surfing on people's sofas every night um
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's a real crisis when I was I've been
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
following these issues on homelessness
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the state for 22 years and 14 years
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
ago I went up to Claremont and at that
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
time one in 10 children in the Claremont
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
School System were homeless at some
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
point through the year and I know that
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
probably the number of homeless kids in
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester now just Manchester probably
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
outnumbers the number that was through
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
the entire State probably 20 years ago
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing more and more and more
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
of it it is a crisis I think
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire your question is
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
a good one what are we doing I I think
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're trying to
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what's happening out there so
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
we can solve the problem no engineer
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
goes to a site and orders the steel for
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
the foundation before they do a survey
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
first to find out what's happening we
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a centralized place that
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
people can start accumulating the
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
information about the homelessness in
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
this state in order to answer the
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
problem and so I see this as a really
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
important First Step a small investment
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
to start accumulating this data so we
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
can get a better feel for what's
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
happening and it is a crisis out there
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
when kids are out on the street and have
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it I think the national
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
rep reports show that within 72 hours of
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
a child being on the street they're
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to be either approached for drugs
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
or sexual trafficking so these kids are
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly vulnerable and so Waypoint is
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
doing everything they can and we're
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
really proud of our work we're going to
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
have a sleepout coming up here we're
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
having one in conquer we're having one
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
in Rochester we're having one in
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester but we really need to get a
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
better idea of what's Happening
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire State and I I I
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
think this position is incredibly
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
important for that so thank you for your
 
01:45:40.109 --> 01:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
time would you take a question or
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
two was going to go to representative
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
Sweeney first so thank you represent
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for being
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the testimony how
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
much would 20 beds cost to add 20 beds
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
to the facility um so don't hold me just
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
to this but I think it costs us about
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year to run that facility to
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
manester I can get that number for you
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay um we're incredibly efficient if
 
01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
you go down there we'd love to give you
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
a tour um the kids have they're all
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
bunked in one room um they have like a
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
5x 10t section that they have a bed and
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
just one little Locker that they can go
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
into that they can put their stuff into
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
the night I mean it's nothing it's it's
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
nothing fancy by any means but we have
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
one of our children um actually at this
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
point is in college trying to get their
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
college degree we actually had a
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
pregnant teen that um was there and we
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
also had a teen that ended up graduating
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
from high school um that was at our
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
shelter and our staff went to them and
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
helped them with the cap and gown so
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
they could watch him graduate so I I
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
think what Emily and and Lisa were
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
talking about which is these are not
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
irredeemable lives and the reason that
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
kids 18 to 25 don't want to be with a
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the chronically homeless is they
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to be listen laying next to
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
people that are 50 years old that have
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
been in the system for 35 years we need
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
to get them as early as possible and get
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
them turned around and between jobs core
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and high school and college we can save
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
these kids' lives if we get there at the
 
01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
right time but if we don't know who they
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
are and we don't know the numbers we
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
can't possibly solve the
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
problem followup I get but you've been
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
the efforts in Manchester turned away
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
kids because there weren't enough beds
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we do know the problem we do know who
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
they are we just need more beds it seems
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be not more staff no so there are two
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
issues thank you for the question
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
representative one is we don't we don't
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
have the beds at this time but I can
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
tell you with assurity that we turn away
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
children every night because we have to
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of system for who's coming in
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
there the other problem is Staff it is
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
it is difficult finding Staffing because
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do this right you
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
know a lot of times people think they'll
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
say well there's an old house just let
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
kids stay there that's not the solution
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
you you need they need structure just
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
like like any 18 to 25 year old right I
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
mean everything we see about brain
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
development is that these are the last
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
important years of children having their
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
brains developed to do the right thing
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so it's a combination of us having
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
more funding to have the beds for the
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
kids and then that funding would also
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
have to cover the the extra staff we
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
would need to cover to make sure that
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
children are getting what they need so
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of those two things
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
but I I use that number just to give you
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
some sense of what's happening every
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
night in Manchester I mean
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative long knows it too well
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
the the money is spending and the
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
majority of our money in the state and
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
rightfully so goes to adults because we
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
haven't had this crisis right I mean it
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense that the money would go to
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
the adults to take care of them first
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
and families through domestic violence
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
shelters but but what we're seeing is
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
this new growing problem and we have to
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to deal with it so I'm
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
sorry if it went on too long
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative lman uh representative
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire no
 
01:48:49.629 --> 01:48:49.639 align:start position:0%
yes um representative grassy like to
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass motion's been made to
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass a here
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
second second second by representative
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
hwit when
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk is ready we'll call the role
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
please discuss oh would you like
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Maguire yeah thank
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
you so I have the same sort of concerns
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
I think that representative Sweeny had
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
with asking his questions because if we
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
spend this $100,000 a year on this
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
that's $100,000 a year we're not putting
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
into actual Services right and so the
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
problem is not finding kids that need
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
Pro need help we hearing that there's so
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
many of
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
them that's the problem right so so I
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't see to me it doesn't sound like
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to help that much compared
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
to extra beds extra food extra whatever
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing Mr chairman
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative like to speak to my
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
motion as well um the thing is is is is
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
I disagree and I think this is a very
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
important thing I've had to I've visited
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
the way point facil in Rochester and I
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
think it's tremendous what they're able
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
to do for children and the thing is is
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
that there is that age group that is
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
sort of left out left out in the cold um
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not they're they're too old
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
for foster but they're not old enough
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
really to get into the into into the
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter situation that he spoke
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
about with 50y olds and 60 year olds
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
that are out there and the the other
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
people that are that are that have
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
problems and what this advocate's
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
position is supposed to be doing is is
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
to be and if if you look at the bill it
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
will identify programs it will identify
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
other sources of money and resources
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
that are available in the community I
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
mean Rochester needs to have a facility
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
where we can House people I mean they
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
have it basically just it's a day
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
program allows people to do their their
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
laundry it allows them to get a meal it
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
allows them to have a place to do their
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
homework I will tell you I have
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed waiting at a park
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
and ride to come here and
 
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
conquered car sitting in a parking ride
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden I see two heads Pop
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
I see one head pop up in the front seat
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
I see a head pop up in the back seat you
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
see somebody get out of the car run into
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
the woods you know what they're doing
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then the other guy gets out in the
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
back gets his backpack out and he's
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
shuffling his books guy comes back and
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the other guy goes out into the woods
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
Guy starts shaving right in his car
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
right there with bottled water in the in
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
in in a period where it was cold
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
out now Waypoint probably wasn't
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
available for them at that that early in
 
01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
available for them at that that early in
the

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
morning but the thing is is that what
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
this person will do is it will
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
identify resources available and maybe
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
maybe it will also identify where there
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
are no resources available where we need
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
them and I think it's this is a small
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
amount to pay certainly we have to do
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
more for housing we all know that and
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're there are groups out there that
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
are talking about housing all over the
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
place most of them talk about the older
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
crowd I've also looked at housing for
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do for for this age
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
group as well that this bill wants to
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
identify and wants to to focus on this
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
is very very important I think this is
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
even more important than the older
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
population that we have out there that
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
is homeless because these kids it's not
 
01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:08.470 align:start position:0%
is homeless because these kids it's not
their

01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
choice some people when you get to a
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
certain age it's you know and and it is
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
it is their choice to be homeless but I
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't I think very few people make that
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
choice but these people they don't even
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
have that this is not a for them at all
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
they're just stuck in this
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
situation and uh whether it be family or
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
whatever situation happens to be um this
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
is small money to solve and and to help
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
start solving a major problem in the
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative grassy I
 
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree with you more
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
um yes representative swe followed by
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative huitt thank you Mr
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I I don't think anyone here
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
disagrees that homelessness especially
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
especially among younger members of our
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
society is a pressing issue for the
 
01:52:53.079 --> 01:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
society is a pressing issue for the
grant

01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
State the reason why I can't support
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
this bill as as as written today uh in
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note this is utilizing
 
01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:03.639 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan act funds to get
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
started on the position and then it
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
would go into the budget afterward so
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're using onetime money to create a a
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
staff level position that would then be
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
continued by Future taxpayer money my
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
position would be if there is this
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
available American Rescue plan act funds
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
available to us we should be using that
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
onto the infrastructure of getting more
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
beds getting more facilities up and
 
01:53:26.189 --> 01:53:26.199 align:start position:0%
running online to actually house these
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
individuals as soon as possible instead
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
of hiring a staffer that will identify
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of how many resources are
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
out there that aren't being utilized to
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
the maximum currently uh and I would be
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
disheartened if there were hundreds of
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars out there in grant
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity and nonprofit funds
 
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
that people are out there they may be
 
01:53:49.629 --> 01:53:49.639 align:start position:0%
advertising we have this help available
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
but but nobody is directing those in
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
need towards it um so I'm not sure how
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to identify new funds that
 
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
are just sitting there that people
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of that aren't using I
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
think they can identify every need in
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
the book uh for for future spending and
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
future funds to to actually address the
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
issues of homelessness I just don't see
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
the staffer being able to do it uh and I
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
think the the use of the the arpa money
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
can be used more effectively actually
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
providing homes and and beds to these
 
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
homeless uh the youth and and to all
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
homeless of all ages so that's just what
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
to uh representative hwit followed by
 
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
to uh representative hwit followed by
representative

01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
grassy well the the the concept of not
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
funding something like this uh in
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
addition to not providing any Services
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
kind of sends out a message that well we
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
this really isn't the kind of pro kind
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
of problem we need to deal with
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
today uh we can we can know look for
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
other things to do with this money
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
um but when you're looking at what the
 
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
reason is you're spending you're not
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
spending it just because people are out
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
of out of a home you're spending the
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
money because these are people that are
 
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
different from the average person who
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
who is out of a home uh there's there's
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
homeless people all over the place uh
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
and typically over the years you you
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
find most of the homeless people in in
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
the upper age category and those those
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
are the people who actually if you give
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
it be a little bit curious about it they
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
PE they are people who have a little
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
more ability to find
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
stuff kids don't kids have have all
 
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons why not to do
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
it I just look at the drug program Pro
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
problem and the
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh the relationship among children even
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
into the upper age of of child
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
childness uh is an indication that there
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
is there is a problem that needs to be
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
solved and just providing a place to do
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't meet doesn't meet the
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
requirements of getting them educated
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
and out of that situation so I I think
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
that it's worth doing now and that all
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
also doing this now could uh could
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
encourage other
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
organizations that may have the ability
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
to do this to stop and think about what
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing and whether the whether
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
the money they're spending is being
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
spent as as critically as it could be
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grass yeah I I
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
I I have to disagree I you know I agree
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
with everything that representative you
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
had said I think that's that's very
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
important that who whoever gets this
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
position could help basically drum up
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
more resources for this the money in
 
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
this is not going to solve our problem
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get you you can't
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
even get one bed for $100,000 uh I mean
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
because you have to find a facility to
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
put those beds in first and you can get
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
a facility if you don't have beds in it
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have staff it you don't
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have really any place to put
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
people this is small money that's not
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to make a dent in beds and
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
Facilities but what it is is it
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
leverages a lot of other resources and
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
money and I think representative you
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
would hit it on the head that this
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
person get gets out there works with
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
communities works with other groups
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
works with the religious communities in
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
in in in these cities and towns to be
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
able to bring them together to solve
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
this problem and I think this is just a
 
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
good start we're not you know it if next
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
year we say you know we didn't see
 
01:57:47.709 --> 01:57:47.719 align:start position:0%
anything happen we we don't think this
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
is worth the money we can we can deal
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
with it at that time and maybe we don't
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
fund it for a second year but the thing
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
is I think get the program started and
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
let's see what we can do and maybe
 
01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
there'll be some results happening from
 
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
this thing um I think this is a good
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
program I think this is someone we need
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
to lead our efforts to solve the problem
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
for youth homelessness um you know too
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
many kids are out there couch surfing
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
and like I said it's it's not their
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
choice whether they're leaving an
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
abusive family or they've been thrown
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
out of their house I had a kid lived
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
with me one time for six to eight months
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh because they got thrown out of their
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
house and we gave them the opportunity
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
to become productive a productive
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
citizens um which their family didn't
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
feel they wanted to to work with them at
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
all at that time it was it was a
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
difficult situation but the thing is is
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
that a lot of families a lot of kids
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I think that this is
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
small dollars that will not make any
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
difference if you try to put it out
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
there for resources
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
today but will help us for resources
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:51.189 align:start position:0%
today but will help us for resources
tomorrow

01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:58:51.199 --> 01:58:52.510 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
represent

01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
CS yes I was wondering if I could ask do
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
you have people that do this job right
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
now and how many for what you would call
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.109 --> 01:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
population so that might take both of us
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
um the office of child advocate only
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
serves children so we have two current
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
we call them assistant child Advocates
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
they're essentially ud's positions who
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
do this work with the system involved
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
children so when they take a call they
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
are social workers in fact most of us
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
actually used to work for dcyf or
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice work within that system
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
but also pulling in resources exactly as
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying from outside the system
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
that other state agencies really can't
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
do and sometimes that Community Services
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
can't do so we we are lucky that we get
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
to bridge that Gap kind of to touch both
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
state agency resources as well as
 
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:56.350 align:start position:0%
state agency resources as well as
Community

01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
Resources I agree with you
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney there's probably
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
not some bucket of money sitting
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere that no one's discovered what
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
we do is make those
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
connections creative problem solving
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
with all these different siloed agencies
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we currently do for children
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
who are impacted by the system this bill
 
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
Not only would give us money to create a
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
third on buds person position focused on
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
this issue but also would expand our
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to allow us to touch those
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
non system involved children because
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's really where our office would
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
love to be addressing this issue but
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
currently the way 21v is written we can
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
only work with system involved children
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
so um I believe some of the community
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups do already do this for
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
adults but as Emily and Keith both said
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
this particular population of children
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
is both head hesitant to reach out and
 
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel comfortable in the current
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
systems so while this position wouldn't
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
be creating new beds it would be making
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
connections and in fact could be making
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
a connection like representative grassy
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
said of finding a kinship or fictive kin
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
person in that child or young person's
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
life to work something out work
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
something out with the school can we
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
find this kid a a bed somewhere so it's
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's really that creative problem
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
solving piece that this position and we
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
do plan to put it in our next budget yes
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
so whoever answered that asked that
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
question earlier we are going to put
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
into our next budget round a third
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
ombud's position but this bill allows us
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
to expand our scope a little bit it's
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
not just a matter of like funding a
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
position it's allowing our office to
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
work with those kids and try and avoid
 
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
them becoming system involved by just
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
creatively finding resources to help
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
them is that answer
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
your thank
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
you yeah having worked in the the
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness field for adults as well
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
the thing is I in straford County I know
 
02:01:58.990 --> 02:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
we have many people who deal with the
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
adult population to try to bring
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
resources together I mean just look at
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
your local welfare director usually
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're the person who's doing a lot of
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
those connections the local cap agencies
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of those connections
 
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
so there are people that are doing it
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
for the adult population they're doing
 
02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
it people for children that are in the
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
system there's just that Gap where we
 
02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
have no services for those those those
 
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
middle I I just like to point out that
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
18 to 25 year old is considered an adult
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
and you know we keep talking children
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
and yet I heard earlier that 13 yearolds
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
show up and they get turned away for
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
legal reasons I can understand but I'd
 
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
be more concerned about those 12 to 16
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
year old 17 year olds and I I would
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
think that 18 to 20 25 year
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
olds would get covered by the adult
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
system that's what you would think just
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
a response there are kids that are below
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 that are not in the
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
system and that's where the the child
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
that I had was below 18 wasn't in the
 
02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
system didn't have any interaction with
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
DCF uh was what we considered a good kid
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
but situations happened to the family
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
that things changed and she had to leave
 
02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
her family um she was she was being
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
thrown out on the streets and and um and
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
and you know we took her in so she
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have to interact with the system
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
but there are there are places and
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
situations now particular where there
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
are a lot of kids and when you talk to
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
some of your High School principles
 
02:03:32.589 --> 02:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
you'll find out there are kids that are
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
not in the
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
system that are sleeping in their cars
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
or couch surfing and those children
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
would be picked up they're under the age
 
02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:44.030 align:start position:0%
would be picked up they're under the age
of

02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%

you yes yeah y um uh the purpose is that
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
um for for us to speak today uh the
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have any opinion any
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but it just wanted
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
to to highlight a certain um um item
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe the committee making consider
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of um in terms of the timing
 
03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
of the information flow for the
 
03:07:20.190 --> 03:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
Department to to get information in
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
terms of um Tax rating setting process
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
further at present um the Appropriations
 
03:07:32.349 --> 03:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
municipality or contributions to the
 
03:07:39.070 --> 03:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system are very likely uh
 
03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
funded at 100% right now as the budgets
 
03:07:44.990 --> 03:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
are um de developed and voted on very
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
shortly and this is reminiscent of I
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
think it was two years ago perhaps very
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
similar phenomenon where the state ended
 
03:07:57.269 --> 03:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
up um paying 7 and a.
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
half% what that means for us at Dr as we
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
get ready for property tax rate setting
 
03:08:06.670 --> 03:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
commencing on October 1st we need to
 
03:08:10.110 --> 03:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
have a precise reconciliation of any
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
state revenues that are being f Ed or
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
sent to a
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
municipality so what happened two years
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
ago it's looking like the same situation
 
03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
ago it's looking like the same situation
could

03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:08:25.710 --> 03:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
unfold where it's
 
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
optimal if in this case the retirement
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
system can calculate what the 7 A half%
 
03:08:37.710 --> 03:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
is for each municipality in dollar terms
 
03:08:39.630 --> 03:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
and communicate that to the Department
 
03:08:41.950 --> 03:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
of Revenue so that we make sure that
 
03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
each municipality
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues which would impact
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
their the local the town or city tax
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
rate uh is
 
03:08:55.630 --> 03:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
accurate um so I guess our request would
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
be is if the bill could reflect the same
 
03:09:04.269 --> 03:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
deadline that agencies um in in agencies
 
03:09:07.870 --> 03:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
are under 20 RSA
 
03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
21j colon
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
35 I'm trying to remember the
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
section um is October 1st so the
 
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
revenues from various State agencies are
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
due to Dr by October 1st and that allows
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
us at that point in theory to begin to
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
calculate the the property tax rates um
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill itself contains no um comment
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
on on when such information would flow
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
to Dr so we thought we would at least
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
ask ask that it be entertained as a a
 
03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
ask ask that it be entertained as a a
possible

03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment represent McGuire thank you
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and taking my
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
question just for interest um so the
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
effective date is July 1 so that's well
 
03:10:01.150 --> 03:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
before but but you're saying we should
 
03:10:03.710 --> 03:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
require municipalities to let you know
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
this information by October 1st no it
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be it would be the retirement
 
03:10:10.389 --> 03:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
system that will do the calculation as
 
03:10:11.910 --> 03:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
we understand it from the prior
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
experience municipalities report various
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh data to retirement at year end June
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
30 and it takes retirement a period of
 
03:10:25.469 --> 03:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
time to then determine what the I guess
 
03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
it would be the fiscal 25 contribution
 
03:10:29.670 --> 03:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
is going to be and from that they could
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
then calculate s and a half% of it so
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.150 --> 03:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
um it it can delay the property tax
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
rates if we have to wait for that number
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
I understand so
 
03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:46.110 align:start position:0%
I understand so
Yeah

03:10:46.110 --> 03:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
Yeah
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
question representative wer I guess I
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
I'll wait I'll wait till later this this
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
isn't uh the area these gentlemen are
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
offering in about what this bill says to
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
me anyway thank you I'll talk
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
later are there any uh other questions
 
03:11:08.349 --> 03:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I guess you're free
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
to go thank you thank
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:14.469 align:start position:0%
to go thank you thank
you

03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
so a question for again Mr
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
Hoffman the fiscal note is quite dated
 
03:11:23.070 --> 03:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
is we have an update as far as
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
the 27.1 three million or is that pretty
 
03:11:33.550 --> 03:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
much oh Marty sure we take the mic
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
please I can't I can speak to the fiscal
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
node because the bill hasn't been
 
03:11:40.469 --> 03:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
amended okay so we still have the
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
introduced version of this all right
 
03:11:46.110 --> 03:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah I I knew uh Mr Hoffman could
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
handle that I I just to kind of follow
 
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
up on on the previous testimony just to
 
03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
explain the mechanics of how this has
 
03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
worked in the past um for the
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
committee's edification the the numbers
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note are
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
represent uh contributions made in the
 
03:12:05.550 --> 03:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
prior fiscal year rolled forward at the
 
03:12:07.389 --> 03:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
payroll growth assumption for each of
 
03:12:11.150 --> 03:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
the respective member groups which is um
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh 2.75 for um police and fire and um
 
03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
2.25 for teachers so we just took the
 
03:12:22.030 --> 03:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
prior fiscal year numbers roll them
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
forward to to get that number and then
 
03:12:25.710 --> 03:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
the the second year of the fiscal note
 
03:12:27.790 --> 03:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
is a roll forward on those assumptions
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
again so we the employers report to us
 
03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
essentially not not quite in real time
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
but on a one-month lag and the rates are
 
03:12:39.309 --> 03:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
a percentage of covered payroll so we
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
can estimate or individual municipality
 
03:12:44.429 --> 03:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
your school district can can estimate
 
03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
what their payroll costs are going to be
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
next October but they're not going to
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
know what those costs are until they've
 
03:12:52.469 --> 03:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
already paid the checks people have left
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's vacancies there's hires things
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
like that so so we don't give them a
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
projected amount to pay you know going
 
03:13:03.630 --> 03:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
forward so uh in the past when the state
 
03:13:07.630 --> 03:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
subsidy um was was in effect uh through
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal 11 I believe um the we had the
 
03:13:17.550 --> 03:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
employers pay 75% of the rate and then
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
the other 25% in that in that last
 
03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year was coming from the state of
 
03:13:23.550 --> 03:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I understand that the
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
folks from Dr budgets are already set
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 25 and that rate is funded at
 
03:13:31.950 --> 03:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
100% of covered payroll so if the state
 
03:13:36.070 --> 03:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
was reimbursing over the course of um um
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
beginning july24 that would be Revenue
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
that they didn't wouldn't have to raise
 
03:13:43.070 --> 03:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
taxes on I think that would FL itself
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
out after that first year um the way it
 
03:13:48.269 --> 03:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
would be is is um beginning in July
 
03:13:50.590 --> 03:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
employers would be reporting June wages
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
and paying contributions on a percent of
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
those wages in August they'd be
 
03:13:56.830 --> 03:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
reporting July wages and paying a
 
03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
percent and so on and then um you know
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's in a perfect world where all the
 
03:14:03.910 --> 03:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
numbers add up and there's no
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
reconciliation issues occasionally with
 
03:14:08.349 --> 03:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
employer reporting you know there are
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
some discrepancies and it's it's
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
statutorily due um by the 15 of the
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
month but we may have have to do some
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
post reporting reconciliation to to Drew
 
03:14:21.550 --> 03:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
up the numbers so it's it's um it's not
 
03:14:23.630 --> 03:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
as clean as you know we're not sending a
 
03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
bill to to the employer for the next
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
quarter or the next fiscal year we're
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
taking the taking a percentage of their
 
03:14:35.950 --> 03:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
month all right
 
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
now thank you welcome um
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm interested in is the rates that
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
were the employer pays the fire police
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
and teachers and so on and what what
 
03:14:55.870 --> 03:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
they pay and what the employee pays do
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
you have those off the top of your head
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
I I can give you a pretty close
 
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
approximation off the top of my head um
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
for group one uh employees and Teachers
 
03:15:07.950 --> 03:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
Pay 7% out of their you know pay check
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
each period towards nhrs contributions
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's 11.55 for police and 11.8 for fire
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
and those are those are exact numbers on
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
the um on the employer side the one I am
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
least confident in I know it's in this
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
range but it's it's U between 13 and 14%
 
03:15:28.319 --> 03:15:29.070 align:start position:0%
range but it's it's U between 13 and 14%
of

03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
pay um the teacher employers of teachers
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
pay 19.6% of pay and um police and fire
 
03:15:41.229 --> 03:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
are in the 29 and a half to 30% of pay
 
03:15:43.389 --> 03:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
range I mean and I get and I'll forward
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
this over it's posted on the website no
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh cuz I remember when in
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
2011 when we took out the contribution
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
from the state we raised those all up to
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
those percentages they are now correct
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that made up for the fact that the
 
03:16:01.469 --> 03:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
state wasn't contributing everybody
 
03:16:03.070 --> 03:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
forgets that when they keep coming in
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
and saying oh oh you owe it to us you
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
promised us and I I remember in that
 
03:16:10.990 --> 03:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
little town I I have lived in since 1970
 
03:16:12.750 --> 03:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
when this Retirement System first came
 
03:16:15.070 --> 03:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
in the only people in my town that were
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system were the
 
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
teachers and since that time um there
 
03:16:24.030 --> 03:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
were on call firemen there were police
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
that were paid parttime and since that
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
time now we have probably 25 employees
 
03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
that are in this retirement system
 
03:16:34.990 --> 03:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
people forget that the system in 68 had
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
very few of these Town employees it was
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
mostly teachers and they were weren't as
 
03:16:42.269 --> 03:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
many as there are now and and they keep
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
crying about oh that what we're doing it
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
we we need to reduce so last year they
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
put in one time 7.5% and they call this
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
the property tax reduction
 
03:16:57.670 --> 03:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
act along with that this committee sent
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
100 million back from the excess swept
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
money so we sent 126 million back for
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
the 2023 taxes to be reduced they were
 
03:17:12.269 --> 03:17:12.279 align:start position:0%
not so again this is this is a kind of a
 
03:17:14.429 --> 03:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
wasteful way of spending money that
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really amount to anything it
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the town the contribution
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
is so minimal that um you know and
 
03:17:24.070 --> 03:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
another figure I've asked for and maybe
 
03:17:27.229 --> 03:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
you can find it is there was a time when
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
the towns didn't pay very much they were
 
03:17:31.389 --> 03:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
paying at two and a half% while all
 
03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
these other people were paying like five
 
03:17:35.550 --> 03:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
and and and seven and eight and
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
nine when is the point when the employer
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
has contributed more money than the the
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
employees um that's I I have a chart
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
that can present that I know just from
 
03:17:51.950 --> 03:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
from past testimony uh for for the
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
employee and the group one side it was
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
about 2007 was the crossing point where
 
03:17:58.950 --> 03:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
the employer rate was greater than the
 
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
the member rate uh for police and fire
 
03:18:05.309 --> 03:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
for most of the first 30 years of the
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
plan the member was paying more but for
 
03:18:09.630 --> 03:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
about a 10-year period in the 80s the
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
employer rates were were were fairly
 
03:18:13.950 --> 03:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
high for police fire but then they they
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
went back down in the '90s and then um
 
03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
probably early 2000s they they crossed
 
03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
over again so the employer piece was
 
03:18:22.510 --> 03:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
less the law was changed I think in
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
either 2007 or 8 so that the employer
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
rate could never be lower than the
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
member rate and they move in lock step
 
03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
if it ever got back down to that point
 
03:18:34.349 --> 03:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank
 
03:18:36.790 --> 03:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
you representative Griffin followed by
 
03:18:39.150 --> 03:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
03:18:41.790 --> 03:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh thanks for taking the question
 
03:18:44.189 --> 03:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
last last year we had a similar Bill to
 
03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
this and we just we amended that bill to
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
put the money into the unfunded
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
liability so is that for your
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
calculating purposes is that a cleaner
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
calculation because it probably doesn't
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
get affected until the next year yeah
 
03:19:08.349 --> 03:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
only from the acturial calculation if we
 
03:19:11.469 --> 03:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
had an appropriation of x million when
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers are done for the year and
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the actual RRS it up and sets the rate
 
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know they'd be basing it on that so
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know that would reduce the employer
 
03:19:23.030 --> 03:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
contributions by a smaller amount over a
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know a 20-year period essentially
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
while that would be recognized so there'
 
03:19:30.510 --> 03:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
be a oneye lag right yeah yeah the uh we
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
we're just we the board will be getting
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
and and certifying the fiscal 2627
 
03:19:40.110 --> 03:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates this coming
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
summer and and by the same same token
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality would get the benefit
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
more than one year right they continue
 
03:19:50.910 --> 03:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
to get that benefit in terms of less
 
03:19:54.070 --> 03:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
payment of the unfunded liability to to
 
03:19:55.870 --> 03:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
the extent that the liability is less
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
than projected you know that lowers
 
03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
employer rates and and this this bill
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
has structured funds the 7 and a half%
 
03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
going forward as well so there's a
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's a savings on both sides that way
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
the 2022 was a onetime payment that was
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
a little weird because it was
 
03:20:14.189 --> 03:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
we had to wait for the end of the fiscal
 
03:20:16.510 --> 03:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
year true up the numbers and then you
 
03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
know the state cut a check for a lumpsum
 
03:20:20.349 --> 03:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
rather than on a monthly basis so that
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
that also caused some issues with uh
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue with some towns we weren't able
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
to to reconcile till quite late in the
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
year thank you represent Maguire thank
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Marty for
 
03:20:37.389 --> 03:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
coming um the difference you mentioned
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
between group one and teachers is that
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
mainly due to the lower number of group
 
03:20:46.349 --> 03:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
one employees who get bested uh couple
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
of couple of factors there yeah they um
 
03:20:52.590 --> 03:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
group as a whole group one employees
 
03:20:55.229 --> 03:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
tend to retire those who go on to
 
03:20:57.790 --> 03:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
retirement retire with fewer years you
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
you think teacher police and fire those
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
sort of Lifetime career type jobs it's
 
03:21:05.070 --> 03:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
not unheard of to put in 25 30 years
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
certainly there's a lot of career state
 
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
employees who've put in that kind of
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
years but when you think about the
 
03:21:12.269 --> 03:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
smaller towns there's a lot of CH so may
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
work there 5 years 10 years and that's
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that that and the the pay differences
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
between say a Municipal Employee and a
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
teacher salary are the two reasons why
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
the rates are lower those those
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
demographic issues right if I can follow
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
up what um what fraction of group ones
 
03:21:32.110 --> 03:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
work for the state versus
 
03:21:35.790 --> 03:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities um we have uh there's
 
03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's about 10 about 10,000 group one
 
03:21:42.830 --> 03:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
state employees and group one as a whole
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to I we have about
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
24,500 total group one that's the
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
largest group it's about half of the
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
total population half okay when you when
 
03:21:56.429 --> 03:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
you throw in state state employees with
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
a capital plus the group two state
 
03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
employees State policing Corrections
 
03:22:05.309 --> 03:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
membership did you have a question
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny no
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
s so just a let the committee know where
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill came from it was vacated uh
 
03:22:18.750 --> 03:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
from Edna to us we held a public Hearing
 
03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
in full Finance on the 29th of
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
January and we must act quickly we never
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
have to act quickly but well this has a
 
03:22:30.429 --> 03:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
different deadline the most so I I guess
 
03:22:33.389 --> 03:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
you're all set Marty with us I see the
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor here Mike do you have
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:48.349 align:start position:0%
 
or

03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:50.349 --> 03:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
and just uh state your name for the
 
03:22:50.359 --> 03:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
and just uh state your name for the
record

03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
please uh yes Mr chairman uh my name is
 
03:23:04.670 --> 03:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
Mike Edgar I represent Hampton and uh
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes this is my bill I did speak on it on
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
the 29th of
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
January I'll try not to cry while I'm up
 
03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
here as I'm talking about this this bill
 
03:23:16.110 --> 03:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh and asking for money for the for the
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
towns the counties and others that
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
benefited from this this onetime payment
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know recently so um you
 
03:23:29.710 --> 03:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
know the towns benefited from this the
 
03:23:31.510 --> 03:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
counties benefited from it when we had
 
03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the one year yeah they got they
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually got money and uh so I guess the
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
question is if in fact would be uh it
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be good to do this long term
 
03:23:44.110 --> 03:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
and my good friend reny talked to me
 
03:23:45.790 --> 03:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
about this for a long time and and
 
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I brought it
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
back again um it does benefit the towns
 
03:23:53.309 --> 03:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
and it benefits it in a more direct way
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
if you give them an actual payment
 
03:23:58.590 --> 03:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
versus decreasing the uh unfunded
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
liability you know over a period of 10
 
03:24:03.389 --> 03:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
20 years the difference that the way it
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
affects the towns themselves is amazing
 
03:24:09.189 --> 03:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's tough to judge how
 
03:24:10.469 --> 03:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
what was going to happen or how it
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
happened with a a onee um dispersement
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
that you gave if it was longterm then
 
03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
the towns and the counties could count
 
03:24:22.590 --> 03:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
on it even some of the you know some of
 
03:24:24.389 --> 03:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
these these groups you know they didn't
 
03:24:26.590 --> 03:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
you for the one year because of the way
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
the budget's go and everything it didn't
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
decrease but uh I think that this is a
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill it's really could
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
benefit the towns cities counties and um
 
03:24:41.670 --> 03:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
I know that there's a little bit of
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's some paperwork involved and I
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
know our people can handle it so is
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
there any questions for
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
me any
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone out there that would
 
03:25:05.950 --> 03:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the bill seeing
 
03:25:08.590 --> 03:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
none uh what would the division like to
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
wer did this last year it was labeled
 
03:25:16.830 --> 03:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
property tax reduction Bill the same
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
75% it didn't make any difference even
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
when we included 100 million of reduced
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
swep payments so we spent six 126
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
million back to the towns did anybody
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
here see a tax reduction in
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
2023 that was with another 100 million
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
on top of it this is a waste as you hear
 
03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
it gets complicated for what they do
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
with Dr it gets complicated for all
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
these things that they have to do a lot
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
of work a lot of paperwork and the
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
results are not there I would move in
 
03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:51.510 align:start position:0%
results are not there I would move in
expedient

03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
expedient
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
second the motion's been made by
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative Wier and seconded by
 
03:25:56.279 --> 03:25:57.510 align:start position:0%
representative Wier and seconded by
representative

03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
Maguire inexpedient to legislate are
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
there any comments questions before we
 
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
vote I I'll make it yeah sure thank so
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is we've already had
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
this bill last year right this was house
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill 50 I think identical and as you may
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
remember we made a big compromise on
 
03:26:22.349 --> 03:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
that to switch it to 50 million for the
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability the house passed it
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the floor we put it in the budget the
 
03:26:31.630 --> 03:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
Senate ripped it out so this year we
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
repurposed House Bill 436 for the exact
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
same purpose and uh that is now in the
 
03:26:40.590 --> 03:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
Senate and when it comes to a hearing I
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
will go in for it um so so in my mind
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is is already still active
 
03:26:51.670 --> 03:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
even though it's in a different form but
 
03:26:54.189 --> 03:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
it but it essentially meets the same
 
03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
purpose not in the same way so that's
 
03:27:00.429 --> 03:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
why I think we it's inappropriate to
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
pass it now thank
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
you are there any more comments I guess
 
03:27:09.189 --> 03:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to say is even though I do
 
03:27:12.030 --> 03:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
support what this bill is looking for a
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
$27 million hit at this time when we
 
03:27:16.990 --> 03:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
have probably over a hundred million
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
still on division one's plate is
 
03:27:21.070 --> 03:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
something we need to consider
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and I have a
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
retirement bill which I think has about
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
$50 million which is based on a
 
03:27:31.950 --> 03:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
commission recommendation so um I will
 
03:27:34.030 --> 03:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
be voting in support of the itl because
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have the sufficient
 
03:27:39.389 --> 03:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
this and that being said if the clerk is
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
ready please call the
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%

January somebody here like to speak the
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:14.030 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
State

03:29:14.030 --> 03:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Secretary of State David
 
03:29:20.830 --> 03:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
scanlin and I did do a little research
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
to kind of get some costs on uh uh on
 
03:29:26.189 --> 03:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
what a New Hampshire Constitution would
 
03:29:28.269 --> 03:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
look like I've got a prototype here I'm
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
around uh interestingly the cover is
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually the ratification copy of the
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
ratification document that that uh made
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
us a country so that's kind of neat but
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
anyway uh in terms of the cost of
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
printing that uh
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
5,000 copies is just over
 
03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
$5,000 10,000 copies is about
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
$9,000 and 15,000 copies is uh right
 
03:30:01.080 --> 03:30:02.590 align:start position:0%
$9,000 and 15,000 copies is uh right
around

03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
$112,000 uh in contrast we print the the
 
03:30:07.469 --> 03:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
larger Constitution that is made
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
available for school children uh in New
 
03:30:13.790 --> 03:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we print 5,000 of those uh
 
03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
every year um and that at a cost of
 
03:30:17.840 --> 03:30:19.150 align:start position:0%
every year um and that at a cost of
about

03:30:19.150 --> 03:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:30:22.510 --> 03:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
$7,500 so uh those are are a little bit
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.790 --> 03:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
um the um you know in terms if the
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee decides to move forward with
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
that in terms of uh
 
03:30:37.870 --> 03:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
timing uh there are going to be a couple
 
03:30:38.830 --> 03:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like there are going to be a
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
couple of constitutional questions on
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh this fall and if they pass obviously
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
the text of the Constitution is going to
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
change accordingly so uh you might want
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
to consider that when uh uh you know if
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
you decide to move forward and make an
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation that you know if you do
 
03:31:00.990 --> 03:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
decide to have some of those printed I
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
would suggest doing maybe
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
5,000 and then after the election's over
 
03:31:08.070 --> 03:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
we can see if there's going to be any
 
03:31:11.070 --> 03:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
textual changes to the Constitution and
 
03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
then print a larger amount after
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
that questions for the secretary um sure
 
03:31:20.030 --> 03:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire thank you so um thank
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
you for coming obviously
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm surprised the price difference
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
isn't that much right the other book is
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
more than twice that size and and you're
 
03:31:32.670 --> 03:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
said this this one's a dollar and that
 
03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:33.630 align:start position:0%
said this this one's a dollar and that
one's

03:31:33.630 --> 03:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
one's
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
a150 is that right yeah the um so using
 
03:31:41.070 --> 03:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
5,000 because that's the number that uh
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the cost of the larger ones is about
 
03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
7500 yeah and the cost of the smaller
 
03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
one is just under Ju Just over 5,000
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so the larger ones are well that'
 
03:31:57.870 --> 03:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
be about 50% more expensive um you know
 
03:31:59.710 --> 03:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of the cost and I'm
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
speculating here I don't know this for
 
03:32:03.630 --> 03:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
certain I think a lot of the cost is the
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
setup charges uh things like that and
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
then that is a nice glossy cover so that
 
03:32:11.950 --> 03:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
that adds a little bit to the expense as
 
03:32:11.960 --> 03:32:17.070 align:start position:0%
that adds a little bit to the expense as
well

03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:19.469 --> 03:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
okay are there any additional questions
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
for the secretary seeing none thank you
 
03:32:22.479 --> 03:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
for the secretary seeing none thank you
sir

03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I I have an amendment oh no you
 
03:32:34.590 --> 03:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
does if you could see that the secretary
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:32:44.750 --> 03:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
once everybody yeah once everybody has a
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
copy representative McGuire will discuss
 
03:32:46.960 --> 03:33:03.389 align:start position:0%
copy representative McGuire will discuss
his

03:33:03.389 --> 03:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.399 --> 03:33:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's all right represent all right so
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment does two things right
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
first of all the timing so I agree with
 
03:33:18.670 --> 03:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
um secretary of state that the
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
constitution because we passed that
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
slavery Constitutional Amendment it
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
seems very likely that that will change
 
03:33:28.429 --> 03:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
the constitution in this November so
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment takes effect um in the
 
03:33:34.750 --> 03:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
next budget basically July 1st
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
2025 so that we don't end up printing
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
ones that are going to be quickly
 
03:33:42.510 --> 03:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
obsolete right so
 
03:33:46.349 --> 03:33:46.359 align:start position:0%
um and so the idea is they can develop
 
03:33:48.189 --> 03:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
it and it looks like he's already got it
 
03:33:50.670 --> 03:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I was thinking over the spring
 
03:33:54.750 --> 03:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
next year and then um print it starting
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
July 1 and put the money in his budget
 
03:34:00.670 --> 03:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that this amendment
 
03:34:03.790 --> 03:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
does um is
 
03:34:07.150 --> 03:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
that and I don't oh yeah is that if
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wants like a box of them they
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to give it way for free they
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
can charge them for the costs right so I
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
don't think it's right for the state to
 
03:34:20.429 --> 03:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
be subsidizing groups or whatever so so
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
this lets him charge the cost for for
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
the boxes that's
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
all are there questions for
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire concerning his OT
 
03:34:30.359 --> 03:34:31.189 align:start position:0%

motion could could we change the date
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
make maybe make it an earlier date than
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
July because we're going to know in
 
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
November what the Constitution is going
 
03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
to be that's true but I I wanted it the
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
money for it he can put it in his budget
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
put in his budget okay thank

I have am
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
22 but I don't think
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
22 but I don't think
it's

03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
for me sen Bill 22 is the most
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
problematic bill
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%

03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
right and I again it's two separate
 
03:40:16.239 --> 03:40:19.830 align:start position:0%
right and I again it's two separate
things

03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%

03:54:58.269 --> 03:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.279 --> 03:55:01.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah that's in case get years hey Sir Mr
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members for the
 
03:55:09.070 --> 03:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
record on Major General David mtis the
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
General New Hampshire National Guard
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
03:55:14.149 --> 03:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
veteran services and I'm Warren Perry
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy agent general for the
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
veteran services I'll keep this brief um
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge to the Department
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
of Defense today is not China or Russia
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's our ability to maintain our all
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer Force how do we man it there's
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
two major levels levers assession
 
03:55:32.830 --> 03:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
getting kids to join and retention
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
keeping them in uniform two years ago
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
you solved our sort of ass sessions
 
03:55:39.630 --> 03:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
challenge where we offer $1,000 referral
 
03:55:41.790 --> 03:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
bonus to anyone refer someone to join
 
03:55:44.110 --> 03:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
the National Guard how do we take care
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
of retention those mid-career sergeants
 
03:55:50.189 --> 03:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
right generally speaking there is a
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
federal retention bonus when there is
 
03:55:57.070 --> 03:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
not we want to use state general funds
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
to apply to a state retention bonus for
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
our mid-career sergeants to keep them in
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about when we
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
testified at the federal labor uh
 
03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing
 
03:56:10.990 --> 03:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
we said we would live within our means
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
we are comfortable doing that within our
 
03:56:12.680 --> 03:56:13.510 align:start position:0%
we are comfortable doing that within our
current

03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation I don't want to mislead
 
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
you maybe two years from now we come
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
back to you for additional funds we'll
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
cross that bridge when we get there
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
right now we're comfortable with living
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
within our means figuring out what the
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
demand signal is how that budget goes
 
03:56:29.550 --> 03:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'll reconsider a re-evaluate
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
at that point in time subject to your
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions that's all I have thank you
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
I have two questions first um why would
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
some members be eligible for a federal
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
bonus and some
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't sir great question is super
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
complicated uh we have different
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
categories of service members you could
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
be a full-time active duty Guardsman we
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
call AGR active Guard Reserve you we
 
03:57:04.750 --> 03:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
have it's also so called a title 32 dual
 
03:57:06.429 --> 03:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
status technician where you're a federal
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
employee Monday to Friday and wear a
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
uniform then you drill a week in a month
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
and though by the way we have
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
traditional Guardsmen who drill a week
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
and a month and have 70% of our Force
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
you have that next thing you have is you
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
have Deployable units you have non-
 
03:57:20.429 --> 03:57:20.439 align:start position:0%
Deployable units right you have
 
03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
Deployable units like a high Mars
 
03:57:22.830 --> 03:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
Battalion that just came back from the
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
Middle East a military police who just
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
came back from the Southwest border but
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
then we have like a Garrison unit like
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
the headquarters element that doesn't
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
deploy those different C classifications
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
and categories dictate who can and
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
cannot qualify for a federal retention
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
bonus so so at at the end of the day
 
03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
units that are not in table of
 
03:57:45.630 --> 03:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
organizational equipment units so
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're called table of
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
distribution allowances so they're just
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
kind of support folks that run the the
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
the state headquarters they're not
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
eligible Federal technicians who are
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
actively serving that that in that as a
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
federal employee and their dual status
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the guard are not eligible for
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
reinvestment bonuses so that's that's
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
generally the answer to your question is
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
it all right so just to follow up on
 
03:58:12.149 --> 03:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
that is it is this a very small number
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the total force is that it or yes sir
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's like less than 200 people
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
would be eligible okay compared to like
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh 2800 gotcha okay thank you my my
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
other question was are are is the
 
03:58:27.189 --> 03:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
National Guard still assisting the
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections in the prisons
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
no we are not it was a 90-day mission
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
that ended last April we are not no oh I
 
03:58:41.149 --> 03:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
see okay so they hired enough to
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they we we'll let we'll let
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks answer that question
 
03:58:47.309 --> 03:58:47.319 align:start position:0%

04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
visit with our friends in division
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
3 this passed on a Voice vote back on
 
04:41:45.440 --> 04:41:46.788 align:start position:0%
3 this passed on a Voice vote back on
January

04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
January
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
3D uh the division has already had one
 
04:41:52.110 --> 04:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill back on the
 
04:41:54.510 --> 04:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
16th and initially it passed out a
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice 20 to
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
Z so someone here that would like to
 
04:42:03.310 --> 04:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
speak to Senate Bill
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
252 yes
 
04:42:08.948 --> 04:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
you take a seat and just identify
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.910 --> 04:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
record my name is uh representative
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
David Muse I am from uh from Portsmouth
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm the deputy ranking member of
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice and Public Safety
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:35.830 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice and Public Safety
Committee

04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
um right now one of the things that uh
 
04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
is being distributed to you is
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
essentially an overview of the bail Bill
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
compromise uh that uh we came to after
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
many many many uh work sessions um so
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
the the compromise itself is spread over
 
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
four bills uh s SP 252 is is one of the
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
four bills um and essentially what we're
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
trying to do is Achieve the legislative
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
objectives that you see uh at the top of
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
this sheet uh across four bills uh which
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
isn't terribly easy um
 
04:43:15.070 --> 04:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
so while I think it's uh always best to
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh have all four bills open in front of
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
you um that can be a little bit taxing
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I thought it would be uh uh
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
useful to just put together a quick
 
04:43:26.430 --> 04:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
summary uh like this it kind of shows
 
04:43:26.440 --> 04:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
summary uh like this it kind of shows
you

04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
essentially uh what the different moving
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
parts are in the different
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
bills this particular Bill SB 252 uh
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
relative uh to release of a defendant
 
04:43:41.070 --> 04:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
pending trial directing establishment of
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring program for def
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants released on bail uh
 
04:43:49.230 --> 04:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
and making an appropriation uh therefore
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
um is a bill that actually achieves I
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
think one of the main policy objectives
 
04:43:55.230 --> 04:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to achieve uh in New
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for quite a while um it's
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
essentially creating a situation where
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're reducing the risk of a of a person
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
who uh has committed uh a a violent
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
serious uh felony level crime uh from
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
actually being uh inappropriately
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
released uh and then um uh potentially
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
reoffending while out on bail uh so what
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill does is IT
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
addresses those 12 felony level crimes
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
um it also allows the court or
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
magistrate we talked about magistrates
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
this morning to order preventive
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
detention uh for these or for other
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
crimes if it's determined by clear and
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
convincing EV evidence that release will
 
04:44:43.470 --> 04:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
endanger the safety of that person or
 
04:44:47.110 --> 04:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
the public uh so the bottom line is it's
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
not necessarily limited to these 12
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
felony level offenses similar to the
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
current statute uh there's a provision
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
in there that allows prevent preventive
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
detention um in the event that there's
 
04:45:00.030 --> 04:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that this
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
person presents a danger to themselves
 
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
or others the other thing that it does
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
is it sets a 24-hour limit on the time
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
that a person can be held without a bail
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
hearing um over the course of many many
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
many public hearings and getting the
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
input of uh uh folks from the Judiciary
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
folks from the ACLU and and all kinds of
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders one of the things I
 
04:45:27.868 --> 04:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
think that we learn consistently is that
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
there are definite issues with holding
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
people in jail uh for long periods of
 
04:45:36.030 --> 04:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
time who haven't yet been convicted of a
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
crime um uh that's something that in a
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
lot of ways is aberant uh to our
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
Judicial System um so in addition to
 
04:45:49.310 --> 04:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
setting the 24-hour limit um and and one
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we set the 24hour limit
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
is some of these bills that have come
 
04:45:56.910 --> 04:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
before us have had limits of uh 72 hours
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes longer when you run into a
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
situation like that uh a person who may
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
have been accused of a crime and not
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
convicted stands a good chance to lose
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
their job they might lose their housing
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh they might lose their kids uh there
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
are a lot of consequences to being held
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh held in jail like that so the idea is
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh no matter what
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
crime you're accused of you have a
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing within 24 hours and the
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
magistrate part of the bill which is
 
04:46:25.150 --> 04:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
something that we talked about this
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
morning is one of the things that allows
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
that to happen within that 24hour period
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh currently uh our judges don't work on
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
the weekends
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh and if we are going to have uh if we
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
are going to treat these crimes
 
04:46:40.628 --> 04:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
differently one of the things that we
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
need to do is we need to have a
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
provision in there that essentially
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
allows people to have their cases heard
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
uh over the weekend in a timely
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
fashion uh the bill also uh requires
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring uh for anybody
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
who's released under a protective order
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
so for instance this is an issue that
 
04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
will come up um for instance in a
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
domestic violence situation a
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor domestic violence situation
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
um where the uh the offender and and the
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
victim sometimes may both want to have
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
the person released uh or the or the or
 
04:47:21.628 --> 04:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
the victim may be concerned that the uh
 
04:47:24.310 --> 04:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh that the accused offender may be you
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
know coming back for a second bout or
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
something like that with what what this
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
would require is something that isn't
 
04:47:32.590 --> 04:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
part of our system now which would be a
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
24-hour Electric monitoring for people
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
accused of uh of crimes that are subject
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
to a protective
 
04:47:43.628 --> 04:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
order um the bill also uh authorizes
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
courts to set cash bail amounts only at
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
a level uh that the person being charged
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
can meet so I think the issue here isn't
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
how much money uh we're we're making as
 
04:47:55.708 --> 04:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
a state or not making as a state from
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
bail um the the real issue is do we hold
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
a person uh or do we release some
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
unpersonalized are if there are good
 
04:48:08.310 --> 04:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
reasons to hold a person we hold the
 
04:48:11.708 --> 04:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
person um that that does not change but
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that you have uh you you may be
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
Indigent you may be a low-income person
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
your your income uh once a decision has
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
been made that it's okay to release you
 
04:48:26.350 --> 04:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
um your income really shouldn't play a
 
04:48:28.830 --> 04:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
role in affecting that decision so
 
04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's also part of the uh part of this
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
well um there there are also fiscal
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are made in the bill
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
um there's a
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
$750,000 appropriation uh for the fiscal
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30th 2024 that's this
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh for the State Police to
 
04:48:49.230 --> 04:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
develop a a computerized system that
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
will finally allow uh the court system
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
database to actually uh communicate
 
04:48:57.868 --> 04:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
effectively with law enforcement in the
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
field one of the things that was
 
04:49:01.948 --> 04:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
identified in several of our hearings as
 
04:49:05.470 --> 04:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
a as a significant issue for our police
 
04:49:07.628 --> 04:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
departments was they really have almost
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing unless they were the
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
the the officers who arrested the person
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
before if a person that they're
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
arresting on another crime um is is a
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
person who is currently out on bail so
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh by creating this system that would
 
04:49:26.190 --> 04:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
let an officer know right away if he's
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
arresting somebody who's actually uh
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
who's who's reoffended uh who's been out
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
on bail um it would also appropriate uh
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
$986,000 to the judicial branch uh to uh
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry uh let me see I think I
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
screwed that I mess messed that
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
up um uh and I'm just trying to think of
 
04:49:54.548 --> 04:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
the I would have to look at the bill
 
04:49:56.548 --> 04:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
look at the bill itself it looks like I
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
AG

04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:08.110 --> 04:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
is what happens when you put things
 
04:50:08.120 --> 04:50:18.390 align:start position:0%
is what happens when you put things
together

04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.750 --> 04:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
to I think these are these are separate
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so one is the Department
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
of Safety to implement their part of the
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
system the other is uh to the judicial
 
04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
branch to uh Implement their part of the
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
system um but again this is what this
 
04:50:41.070 --> 04:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
does is it finally would put law
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the field in a
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
position where they would actually have
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
the information that they need in order
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
determination so one of the things I
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
think you can see is that um where we
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
started on S sp250 2 and where we wound
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
up were different places and I think
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was um uh pretty common for all of
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
these bills one of the things that we
 
04:51:14.310 --> 04:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
that I think we really wanted uh to try
 
04:51:19.150 --> 04:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
to do um was to come to um number one I
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
think we wanted to come to a bipartisan
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
agreement that uh that addressed the
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental underlying issues uh that
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
cause our bail system periodically to
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
fail us from a public safety standpoint
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
but I think the the other thing that was
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
really important to us was making sure
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
that we did it in a way that didn't
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
violate people's civil liberties um you
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
know that uh and that uh that
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
essentially protected rights that I
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
think all of us would want to have if we
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
were ever in a situation where we were
 
04:51:54.510 --> 04:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
unfairly um accused of one of these
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
crimes so I think that's one of the
 
04:51:58.548 --> 04:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
things that we have with that I think we
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
had to balance from a a policy
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
perspective is it was important for us
 
04:52:07.548 --> 04:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
to to sit there to listen to the data uh
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
and we got different pictures of the
 
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
data from different people with with
 
04:52:14.190 --> 04:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
different points of view um but I think
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
the most important thing was to to
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually sit there and and listen hard
 
04:52:20.830 --> 04:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
to what everybody had to say and and I
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we came to
 
04:52:26.670 --> 04:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
a realization of is that um there there
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
are there are issues with a system there
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
are ways for us to improve it from a
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
public safety perspective but there are
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
also some fundamental uh underlying
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
systemic problems um that make it more
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that actually increase the risk of
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
people who shouldn't be released of get
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
of getting released and and some of
 
04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
those are with the way that we current
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
do currently do the bail commissioner
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
system um uh others have to do with the
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
fact that you know we have a situation
 
04:53:02.590 --> 04:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
where we continually have um uh the same
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
people being arrested over and over for
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
minor crimes um and uh and and being
 
04:53:11.670 --> 04:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
released and and I think well it's hard
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
to address every single issue you know
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
in in the context of even a compromise
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
like this one of the things that I think
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do is in a situation like
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
that where the underlying systemic issue
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with homelessness has a
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
lot to do with drug abuse has a lot to
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
do with mental health problems is to you
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
know to put the state and and the people
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
of the state in a better position to
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
solve that problem going forward so um I
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think what we tried to do overall in
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
the compromise was to address the things
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
that we could address within the
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and to try to
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
set some things up uh and for instance
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
the um uh HB 653 actually tries to set
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
things up so that issues like um
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
pre-trial services for people who are
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
homeless and who have drug abuse
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
problems and who have mental health
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
issues are things that are approached um
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
not just from a county level but maybe
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
more from a state level more from a a
 
04:54:17.548 --> 04:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
systemic planning level uh and and I
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
think that's really kind of where we
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
tried to tried to get to so as you can
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
see we we had a lot on our plate we took
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
this extremely seriously and um and one
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the things I can't emphasize to you
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
enough is is how important it is to pass
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
this as a
 
04:54:38.120 --> 04:54:40.670 align:start position:0%
this as a
package

04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
package
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
um and with that I can take any
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
questions that you
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
have representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:54:49.548 --> 04:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
coming um the way I look at Senate Bill
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
252 is it has three main parts that all
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
cost money all right and let's start
 
04:55:02.590 --> 04:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
with one of them is the fact that you
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
can't use bail Commissioners for serious
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
crimes that means you need magistrates
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
they need to work on weekends etc etc or
 
04:55:12.788 --> 04:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
judges do one is the electronic
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring of certain um accused while
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're out on bail right and one is
 
04:55:23.548 --> 04:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
this database of sharing uh uh who's on
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
bail with with among law enforcement all
 
04:55:28.510 --> 04:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
right so let's start with the easy one
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
first and that is the electronic
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring as far as I can tell the bill
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
contains no appropriation for that at
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
all um no nothing to buy the ankle
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
bracelets nothing for the people that
 
04:55:54.670 --> 04:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
right okay all right we think it's right
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
all right so second question
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
so the bill
 
04:56:07.390 --> 04:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
um asked I think it asked the Judiciary
 
04:56:08.708 --> 04:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring and um but in reality as I
 
04:56:17.070 --> 04:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
understand it it's the counties who have
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh control over uh defendants right so
 
04:56:22.590 --> 04:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
they're either in county jail or they're
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
placed on bail and they can be monitored
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
by County
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
officers and
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
so it's and beyond that there are at
 
04:56:35.910 --> 04:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
least one County straford County and
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
maybe others that already use ankle
 
04:56:41.548 --> 04:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
bracelets and all already do this kind
 
04:56:44.430 --> 04:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
of monitoring that the bill wants for
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
everybody do you know of is that correct
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
from your your knowledge yes yes okay so
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
um in my sort of back of the envelope
 
04:56:58.030 --> 04:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
calculation I was told that that
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
straford County had 50 ankle
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
bracelets and there's roughly say 300
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
people on on bail at any time in
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
straford County but only 50 of them are
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
wearing ankle bracelets because those
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
are the serious cases and that they have
 
04:57:17.788 --> 04:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
five officers dedicated to monitoring
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
and checking up on those 300 people and
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
so if if I sort of multiply the numbers
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
and say Well straford County might be 8%
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
9% or something of the total that would
 
04:57:34.548 --> 04:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
mean we'd want roughly six 600 ankle
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
bracelets for the whole state does that
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
make sense MH okay so um but I'm I'm
 
04:57:45.750 --> 04:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of changing this so that that
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
becomes a responsibility of the
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
counties and for 28a issues we add some
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
money in here to pay for the ankle
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
bracelets but they they counties are
 
04:57:59.948 --> 04:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
presumably already monitoring they
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
already have the Personnel Etc so
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
therefore we wouldn't put extra money
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
for that we would just put money to buy
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
them equipment right so does that sort
 
04:58:14.110 --> 04:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
of make sense to you it it makes sense
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
and I and I think it's kind of the
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
difference between criminal justice as a
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
policy committee and and this committee
 
04:58:22.948 --> 04:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know with the with the U
 
04:58:26.030 --> 04:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to actually uh you know
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
manage the fiscal part of it um I I
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
think the the important thing not to
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
lose from a a policy perspective is that
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
this will give uh especially victims of
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh and for people who
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
would be protected by protected or
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
protective orders a level of protection
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
that they do not have now uh so this
 
04:58:46.030 --> 04:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
would actually be a significant
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
improvement from a public safety
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
perspective so this was one of the
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
things that we we we looked at really
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
hard when we were going through and and
 
04:58:57.070 --> 04:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
and looking at this bill um because
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
there are there are there are going to
 
04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
be situations and we we heard about them
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
time and time again where you will have
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
people who are under protective orders
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
who who have to be released and and I
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
think we've read about those incidents
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
time after time in the newspapers where
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who's you know been uh who is
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
out on a protective order goes back um
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
gets in contact with person they're
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to stay away from and and
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes violence uh violence as a
 
04:59:27.070 --> 04:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
result so I don't think that that's an
 
04:59:29.070 --> 04:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable outcome to anybody and I
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
think part of what we're attempting to
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
do with this is to to again kind of walk
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
the fine line between simply not taking
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
a person like that putting them in jail
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
and throwing them away you know locking
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
them up and throwing away the key
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
because that person could be the bread
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
winner in the household if that person
 
04:59:51.310 --> 04:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
isn't able to work they may lose their
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
home you know there are all these other
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
things that that that we've heard about
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
so how do you increase Public Safety in
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
a in a situation like that and
 
05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring is a solution that is you
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
said is already used in one County um
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
and is in widespread use for this
 
05:00:10.750 --> 05:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
purpose across the country okay all
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
right so let's let's assume we we've got
 
05:00:16.590 --> 05:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring sort of under control or you
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
know we have a we think we know what to
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
do there um let's go on to database so
 
05:00:28.350 --> 05:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
this bill spends $1.7 million to between
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
the two Department Department of
 
05:00:33.070 --> 05:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Department of Safety to to
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
create a database of essentially
 
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
everybody who's out on bail and and it
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
would be used by police officers when
 
05:00:43.390 --> 05:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
they when they arrest somebody to say
 
05:00:46.990 --> 05:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm arresting you in ASA and
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
find out oh you're on bail in Manchester
 
05:00:51.910 --> 05:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
right something like that is that that's
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
right that's right okay so I spoke to
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
some police officers and they told me
 
05:01:00.030 --> 05:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
they already do this for domestic
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
violence cases maybe not all but but a
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
lot and they use a system they call
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
ncic are you familiar with that system
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
yes so is that essentially the same
 
05:01:16.270 --> 05:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
thing but for just some
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
cases I think it's it's similar I I
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
think what we're talking about would
 
05:01:23.708 --> 05:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
have wider scope and would involve more
 
05:01:26.670 --> 05:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
offenses than NC than what I understand
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes it would more cases right yeah and
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
and I asked my the officer who told me
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
about it is there any reason why you
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't use
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
ncic for the for every case why
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
everybody was on bail couldn't you put
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
them in and they said I don't see why
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
not so do we really need so the question
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
is and maybe somebody behind you can
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
answer better do we really need to spend
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
this money or do we just need to somehow
 
05:01:51.520 --> 05:01:52.430 align:start position:0%
this money or do we just need to somehow
use

05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:01:54.868 --> 05:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
ncic more thoroughly more more
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
extensively a lot of the a lot of the
 
05:01:59.310 --> 05:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
conversations uh that took place around
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen on the back
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
end and hooking the systems up and
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
things of that nature um I think those
 
05:02:07.628 --> 05:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
were between representative Roy um and
 
05:02:09.070 --> 05:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
folks in the judicial branch there may
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
be someone in the judicial branch here
 
05:02:12.548 --> 05:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
who might be able to answer some of
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
those questions okay all right well
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
we'll go on then so now the last one is
 
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
also quite expensive and that is you
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
want to say that you can't use bail
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for certain very serious
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
crimes do we have and and and we're not
 
05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
we have the same problem with with 318
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
is 318 also has this list of crimes that
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners can't be used on I I
 
05:02:45.070 --> 05:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
assume it's the same list essentially
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
right right um but we yeah I'm not sure
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
we have accurate numbers yet as to how
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
many such cases there
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
are uh statewide right so um we're going
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
to need that to know whether that makes
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
sense but just just from your committee
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint this is quite an expensive
 
05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
item because it it requires us to hire
 
05:03:12.920 --> 05:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
item because it it requires us to hire
these

05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
magistrates um just for those particular
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
things and and we heard earlier and
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe this is just anecdotal from from
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
um representative scitec who's a bail
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner that in his 23 years of
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
doing it no judge has ever changed his
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
bail condition
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
right so so is this really a case where
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
the bail
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are are making errors I
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
mean obviously they're human they're
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to make some errors but but so is
 
05:03:47.708 --> 05:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
a judge right so
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
um is there is there a concept here that
 
05:03:51.000 --> 05:03:52.868 align:start position:0%
um is there is there a concept here that
there's

05:03:52.868 --> 05:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
serious you know day after day kind of
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
Errors among the bail Commissioners or
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
is it or is this just you've had a bad
 
05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
case once and twice you know something
 
05:04:03.558 --> 05:04:04.948 align:start position:0%
case once and twice you know something
like

05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we have we've deal we have tried to
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
deal over the last three sessions uh
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
with the whole issues of issue of bail
 
05:04:13.948 --> 05:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the training of bail
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the payment of bail bail
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um we've had a lot of
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
bills that have come before our
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
committee and and one of the things one
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
of my personal observations is that when
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
we get those bills we we tend to get
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
folks from the bail commissioner
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
All-Star team uh who who come and
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
testify and representative scitec is one
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
of them I mean these are people who are
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated public servants they work for
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
next to nothing they a lot of times
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're getting up at midnight to go to
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
a police station um they perform an an
 
05:04:47.948 --> 05:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
incredible service for the State of New
 
05:04:51.830 --> 05:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the issue is is they are
 
05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
leaving uh some of them because they're
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
not being compensated adequately some
 
05:04:59.948 --> 05:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
because they're just sort of Aging out
 
05:05:02.270 --> 05:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
and it's time to go on to something else
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
and it's just a really really difficult
 
05:05:07.470 --> 05:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
to recruit new people uh new people to
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
so in the absence of that one one of the
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
other things you also have going on is
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
um the inconsistency of
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
training um so one of the things we were
 
05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear in in the last session
 
05:05:26.310 --> 05:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
was that after um the initial round of
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
bail reform um uh a lot of the bail
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who came to us had said
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
that they had never received any formal
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
training we also found out that the bail
 
05:05:38.070 --> 05:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner handbook hadn't actually
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
been updated after that initial training
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
so it's it's something where we have
 
05:05:44.430 --> 05:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
these people who perform this great
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
service for us they work virtually for
 
05:05:49.390 --> 05:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
free um and we kind of expect this
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
little machine to sort of keep chugging
 
05:05:52.750 --> 05:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
along and and I think one of the things
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we've realized um and it and it may
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
be through just a handful of of in
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
incidents like this but there have been
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
incidents where people were
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have released people um
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
who might not have been released by a
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
judge uh and and I think one of the
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
things that calls into question is the
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications for being a bail
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner are very different than the
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
qualifications for being a judge or a
 
05:06:21.628 --> 05:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
magistrate and and I think what what
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
what I think uh it it comes down to is
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
the the offenses that are the most
 
05:06:31.868 --> 05:06:31.878 align:start position:0%
serious crimes um should be heard by the
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
most quality ified people when it comes
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
to making a bail decision and I think
 
05:06:38.670 --> 05:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about the problem is
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
if you go too far the other way and you
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate bail Commissioners altogether
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
you wind up with a number of hearings in
 
05:06:48.430 --> 05:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
court that becomes totally unmanageable
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
for our judicial system without
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
significantly increasing the number of
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
Judges so one of the challenges for us
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
is how could we get to a better result
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
um within the bounds of our Constitution
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
and within the bounds of our leg legal
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
framework to protect Public Safety you
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
know how could we do that uh without
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
breaking the bank in terms of the the
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
number of hearings that would be
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
required and the number of Judges that
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
would be required to to sit in on those
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
hearings and public defenders to
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
represent people during those
 
05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
hearings uh so magistrates 15
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
magistrates it seems like a lot it it
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a it seems like a like a big
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
investment but I I would say it's an
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
investment in a better in a
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally better process I think
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a process that establishes clear
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails for um the bill
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners themselves they're going
 
05:07:45.510 --> 05:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
to know what cases they can hear and
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
what cases they can't um uh it's going
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
to create a situation where where people
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
who haven't been convicted of crimes um
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
aren't going to languish away in jail uh
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
just because they've been accused of a
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
bad crime they're going to get a hearing
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours hours and a
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
determination will be made whether they
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
need to keep sitting in jail or whether
 
05:08:09.310 --> 05:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
they can be released so I mean these are
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is sort of where it gets
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
complicated and I mean one of one of the
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why I think we we eventually
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
wound up coming together on this is I
 
05:08:21.868 --> 05:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
think we all realized that there was no
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
way we could individually get everything
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to get out of this
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
process so I so I think part of it was
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
to try and get to a point where
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
um you know where we could we could
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
point to specific things in the bill and
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
say these specific things will
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
measurably improve um Public Safety in
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
the state and they're be and they're
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
supported by processes that are actually
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
workable you know that that's the thing
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of we we can make all kinds of
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
directives as a legislature um but I but
 
05:09:00.270 --> 05:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
I think you know part of our
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility um isn't just to be the
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
folks who stand up on a you know stand
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
up on a Podium and and yell the loudest
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
I mean our our constituents depend on us
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
to actually work together to come up
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
with Solutions and and and good faith
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
Solutions and I think that's what we've
 
05:09:21.628 --> 05:09:21.638 align:start position:0%
tried to do thank you um and I
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand that you want this whole
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
package but you know resources are
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
limited and
 
05:09:37.548 --> 05:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
um it's it's possible that a a partial
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
solution will give you a good way toward
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
the toward you know solving problems
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
right so so you know we might be
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
inclined to to do some but not
 
05:09:50.548 --> 05:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
everything that you want here and and in
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
particular you talked about making a
 
05:09:52.320 --> 05:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
particular you talked about making a
workable

05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
workable
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
solution I'm concerned
 
05:09:59.948 --> 05:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
um we are definitely I think going to
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
give you the bail the the strengthening
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioner system more
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
money definitely paid training all that
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff right and hopefully to get
 
05:10:17.868 --> 05:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
build up the the the um the body of bail
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the problem with the
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
magistrates judges the magistrates
 
05:10:27.150 --> 05:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
system you said you wanted something
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
sort of more effective and more workable
 
05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
but but bail commissioners
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
visit and speak to in person the accused
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the arrested person in the police
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
station right so they get to see them
 
05:10:43.440 --> 05:10:44.670 align:start position:0%
station right so they get to see them
oneon-one

05:10:44.670 --> 05:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
oneon-one
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
and and take the measure of those people
 
05:10:48.680 --> 05:10:50.788 align:start position:0%
and and take the measure of those people
right

05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:10:53.548 --> 05:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
and we're never going to have enough
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
magistrates necessarily to cover the
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
entire state in such a way that people
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
the get together in person it seems to
 
05:11:06.990 --> 05:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
me right and so well they maybe they're
 
05:11:08.830 --> 05:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
going to do it on Zoom or something like
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
that you know but
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's there's an aspect you know maybe
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
the person's better trained but maybe
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're not as effective in that way so
 
05:11:22.270 --> 05:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's something we have to think
 
05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
about further
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions I have a
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
few so looking at the bill is amended um
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
by the house you did mention the
 
05:11:37.548 --> 05:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
$750,000 uh for the State Police and
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
then the $986,000 for the judicial
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
branch data platform and electronic
 
05:11:47.948 --> 05:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
sharing of individuals bail
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
conditions and I looked back at the
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
original um fiscal note and it mentioned
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
U the cost of the judges and Court
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
assistance four judges Court assistance
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
for for a price of $1.5
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
million um that is now I assume gone I
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't see that in the new
 
05:12:17.400 --> 05:12:18.910 align:start position:0%
don't see that in the new
language

05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:12:22.230 --> 05:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
however the latest fiscal note that we
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
have the department of safety says that
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
the U Department anticipates their costs
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
will be significant and I'm not not sure
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
what that is leading to is that
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
significant millions of dollars hundreds
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars and then the
 
05:12:40.990 --> 05:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and we do have a
 
05:12:43.868 --> 05:12:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative here uh from the judicial
 
05:12:46.670 --> 05:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
branch but the judicial branch says the
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
cost of hiring magistrates and again
 
05:12:52.510 --> 05:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
this is the most updated uh fiscal note
 
05:12:54.990 --> 05:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
says that will exceed $2 million so
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
there appears to be maybe Mr Hoffman or
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
Melissa can help me some disconnect over
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
all the different numbers
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh at representative McGuire's
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
request we've invited people from safety
 
05:13:11.070 --> 05:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
um um eron here from the judicial branch
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
and someone from straford County to talk
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
about the electronic
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring um the original fiscal note
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
is now I think this bill was from last
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
year so that was on the bill was
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
introduced yeah the latest one I have it
 
05:13:30.670 --> 05:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
says amended 116 so January but that's
 
05:13:33.310 --> 05:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
almost last year uh or the re the
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
revised the revised one February this
 
05:13:38.708 --> 05:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
year I think is most
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe yeah I have it revised amended
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
on the 16th and revised on the 23rd yeah
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
which has those statements from the
 
05:13:54.830 --> 05:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
court and the department of safety so
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost that's correct it I don't know if
 
05:14:04.350 --> 05:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
this is 100% relevant but in House Bill
 
05:14:06.910 --> 05:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
two last year there was a bill that
 
05:14:10.150 --> 05:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
included Appropriations for this the
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
system yeah and then the Senate amended
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
that came in at the end of the house
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
that's where those dollar amounts for
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations came from at the time
 
05:14:23.430 --> 05:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
um at the Senate's requests we worked
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
with safety in the judicial branch to
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
come up with those numbers for the the
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the systems the $1.7
 
05:14:34.030 --> 05:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.788 --> 05:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
okay because when I get when I add up
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
all the numbers based on the um the bill
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
itself is amended plus the fiscal not
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's like $3.2
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
million so well we'll hear from the
 
05:14:48.548 --> 05:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and Department of Safety
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
and others that try to square this
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
up all right are further questions for
 
05:14:53.400 --> 05:14:54.548 align:start position:0%
up all right are further questions for
representative

05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:56.670 --> 05:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
Muse representative
 
05:14:56.680 --> 05:14:58.510 align:start position:0%
Muse representative
huitt

05:14:58.510 --> 05:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
huitt
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
well part of the problem here is that
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with something that's
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
old uh for example the provision of
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
baale uh in the city of
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
lonia is made by a municipal
 
05:15:19.270 --> 05:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance and
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
the people are arrested all the time and
 
05:15:26.670 --> 05:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
they get brought to in in many cases
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
they get brought to
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
jail there are approximately at the
 
05:15:35.830 --> 05:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
moment I think we have four or five
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
active people who are bail Commissioners
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
within the city of Leonia I haven't been
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
there for a while so I hav not sure but
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
when I was there uh we conduct I cond
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
conducted training sessions uh at least
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
three or four times a year for the bail
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and had individual
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
sessions with new bail
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because that's a difficult
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
job as we're all we're all finding out
 
05:16:04.350 --> 05:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
here here and part of the problem here
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
is money and what we what we got here is
 
05:16:10.590 --> 05:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
not only that we have AR spending enough
 
05:16:13.510 --> 05:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
money we don't know how much we're
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
spending right and based on everything
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing for the last couple of
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
days uh we don't know how much we're
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
spending because we avoid it to the
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
greatest extent possible so if you want
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you want a a a a report on how much
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
money is being spent it's going to be
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
very difficult because number one a
 
05:16:43.230 --> 05:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
large number of people who are arrested
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
brought to the local law enforcement
 
05:16:48.548 --> 05:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
agency and sit around for a while until
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner can be
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
produced uh or if it gets so Tak so long
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
that they can't find a bail commissioner
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the the local judge winds up trying
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
to de divide the
 
05:17:03.240 --> 05:17:04.990 align:start position:0%
to de divide the
spoils

05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
spoils
 
05:17:08.830 --> 05:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.670 --> 05:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
they the the the money the the people
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
are bailed and of course cash bail is
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
not a very popular thing not because not
 
05:17:23.708 --> 05:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
because we only arrest poor people um
 
05:17:26.230 --> 05:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
but because in addition to arresting
 
05:17:29.708 --> 05:17:29.718 align:start position:0%
poor people we have we arrest people who
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
would have the money don't have it
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
available on hand and there is no
 
05:17:38.350 --> 05:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
procedure for getting the money from
 
05:17:40.830 --> 05:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
wherever the heck it is to the to the
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
police station these are they are all
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of crazy little problems that go
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
into this uh and hiring some judges and
 
05:17:51.200 --> 05:17:52.430 align:start position:0%
into this uh and hiring some judges and
some

05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
magistrates not going to do you a bit of
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
good I'm sure the court system will find
 
05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
many good things with them to do uh
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
but and and you can't you can't just
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
bring people in and then let them go
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
home that's the pro that's the situation
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
we have now now and what your problem is
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
representative news is that you can't
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
find all the problems because many of
 
05:18:22.030 --> 05:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
them aren't
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
visible many of the problems are uh
 
05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
invisible to to to everybody
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
except the individuals who are
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
involved because nobody wants to talk
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
about it either so I I I'm when we have
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
it when we have a work session on this
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll empty the room by by giving a
 
05:18:48.670 --> 05:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
speech um but at the at the present time
 
05:18:50.910 --> 05:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
what we're faced with is a
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
dilemma and the work your committee has
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
done is is is
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
outstanding uh and that and the
 
05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
information that you've developed and
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the IDE ideas that you have developed
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
need not be
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
destroyed uh because those are the
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
things that are ultimately going to
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
solve the problem but before you can
 
05:19:13.868 --> 05:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
solve the problem you've got to identify
 
05:19:13.878 --> 05:19:14.590 align:start position:0%
solve the problem you've got to identify
the

05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
cause and know there
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
are I don't know I don't know how many
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners there are in the in
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
the state 95 95 bail Commissioners in
 
05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
the state you know how much they get
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
paid it depends on on where you are
 
05:19:37.070 --> 05:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
because in some places like lonia there
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
is a municipal ordinance I haven't read
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
the ordinance in many years but I don't
 
05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
think it says anything about money uh
 
05:19:49.708 --> 05:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
and money is not available all the time
 
05:19:55.230 --> 05:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
to you know to to furnish the the system
 
05:19:58.030 --> 05:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
with the wherewithal to keep the thing
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
going and and and likewise people are
 
05:20:04.350 --> 05:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
arrested uh in the middle of the night
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
tend not to have a lot of money
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
available right and that's that's that's
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
too bad and it's a bad thing that they
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
know they're going they're going to stay
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
overnight but it ain't their fault and
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
it ain't our
 
05:20:23.788 --> 05:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
fault we got to we got to figure out how
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
how to solve the problem
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
and what youve done of views is you have
 
05:20:35.708 --> 05:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
you have cast cast a light on the on the
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
overall problem and now it's if the if
 
05:20:40.830 --> 05:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature is going to work on it
 
05:20:42.430 --> 05:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to work on it a piece
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
at a time all these you know two new
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
judges well you know what you going to
 
05:20:50.750 --> 05:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
do with two new two new uh Superior
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
Court style judges uh on on bail
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
cases and and it goes on and on the
 
05:21:03.390 --> 05:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
police the the counties most in except
 
05:21:03.400 --> 05:21:05.150 align:start position:0%
police the the counties most in except
for

05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:21:05.160 --> 05:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
for
Hillsboro

05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
05:21:07.760 --> 05:21:09.750 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
um

05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
the over that that that area uh and
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
bringham is not an awful lot of County
 
05:21:20.990 --> 05:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
activity involved in the in the bail
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
system and
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
so I I want I just want to say that you
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
you've done Yan's
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
Duty and and the committee can't be
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
can't be accused of having done anything
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
wrong or about dropping the ball because
 
05:21:41.868 --> 05:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not armed with all
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
the necessary
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
information and finding the information
 
05:21:46.400 --> 05:21:47.910 align:start position:0%
information and finding the information
is

05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
difficult further questions
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative evil I have a just a
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
simple question what is the status of
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
s249 and HB 653 because you said this is
 
05:22:00.718 --> 05:22:01.548 align:start position:0%
s249 and HB 653 because you said this is
a

05:22:01.548 --> 05:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
combination of four bills and I wondered
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
where the other two bills
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
were I believe those passed on consent
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
on the 3 of H January and are back in
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
the hands of the Senate
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay well one of them is the Senate
 
05:22:23.708 --> 05:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
Bill speech 249 I mean maybe you know
 
05:22:23.718 --> 05:22:24.868 align:start position:0%
Bill speech 249 I mean maybe you know
the

05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
answer 653 I think was on consent as
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
well yeah okay Senate Bill 249 was
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
heavily mod modified in the house and um
 
05:22:36.670 --> 05:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
did not come to our well we waved it
 
05:22:39.708 --> 05:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
actually um and so because it didn't
 
05:22:43.788 --> 05:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
have a a anything in the fiscal note um
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
but possibly that was a mistake I don't
 
05:22:50.670 --> 05:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
know um but uh so it's back in the
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Senate um as an amended bill and I don't
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
think they've acted on it and I'm not
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.878 --> 05:23:07.150 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:23:07.150 --> 05:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:10.110 --> 05:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
we'll make that decision shortly I hope
 
05:23:10.120 --> 05:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
we'll make that decision shortly I hope
thank

05:23:11.720 --> 05:23:11.730 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:23:11.730 --> 05:23:13.310 align:start position:0%
thank
[Laughter]

05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
you we still got two more don't yeah
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
we'll have to move this long are there
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative use seeing none I'd like
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
to call the representative from the
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.878 --> 05:23:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
could

05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.400 --> 05:23:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
be

05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
pay hello again Erin krian for the
 
05:23:45.080 --> 05:23:46.470 align:start position:0%
pay hello again Erin krian for the
judicial

05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
branch so obviously you heard there were
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
some questions and uh so to your
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge as far as Senate Bill
 
05:23:58.110 --> 05:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
252 what's the impact on the judicial
 
05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
branch because we've seen a couple
 
05:24:01.150 --> 05:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
different numbers here whether there
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
judges included in that
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
magistrat U the court along with the
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety said there was some
 
05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
significant impact I think the court
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
said $2 million so what can you tell us
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
us thank you for that question there's
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that are
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
addressed very directly in this
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and then there are some
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
that are sort of spread across the
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
package and what what I didn't want to
 
05:24:25.230 --> 05:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
do when I Was preparing some of these
 
05:24:27.548 --> 05:24:27.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes is failed to note that it
 
05:24:29.310 --> 05:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
would be connected so for example the
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
magistrate appropriation is not in this
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
uh but there's extensive reference to
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
magistrates so I noted the cost of
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
magistrates but that is not two million
 
05:24:41.110 --> 05:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
for each of these bills it's 2.2 million
 
05:24:43.150 --> 05:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
across the board to add 15
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
magistrates um the the major cost that
 
05:24:46.760 --> 05:24:47.628 align:start position:0%
magistrates um the the major cost that
are

05:24:47.628 --> 05:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
discussed here uh are the building of
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
this electronic bail data platform and
 
05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of electronic monitoring uh the
 
05:24:57.548 --> 05:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
cost of electronic monitoring I don't
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
know and I really appreciate rep McGuire
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
having looked into it with the counties
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
because I think they are in the best
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
position to tell you what their current
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
costs are so that you can try to
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
extrapolate what the cost for that would
 
05:25:09.628 --> 05:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
be for the State uh it's not something
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
we we currently handle so there would
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
certainly be a large cost if we're
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
responsible but it's very difficult to
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
estimate without doing that work right
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
now what that cost would be uh for the
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
electronic bail data uh interface we did
 
05:25:28.030 --> 05:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
actually bid that with a a vendor uh at
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the time that these questions were asked
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
back with hb2 as Mr Hoffman was
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
mentioning uh and this is the the sort
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
of two-year contract price to which has
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
the very very high front end building
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
the system cost and then the annual
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost after that I believe
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
dropped to a little bit under 300,000
 
05:25:46.830 --> 05:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
which is about the cost of transitioning
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
a case type to P from a paper to
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
electronic system uh you know New
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like many states does not have
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
a fully electronic uh case management
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
system many case types are still done in
 
05:26:00.110 --> 05:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
paper people mail their filings to the
 
05:26:01.948 --> 05:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
court or come in person and file them in
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
paper and that's true for a number of
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
our criminal cases as well a number of
 
05:26:07.390 --> 05:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal cases that occur in the
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
circuit courts are done in paper so bail
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are going to the um
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
different police stations sometimes the
 
05:26:16.750 --> 05:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
jails and they are filling out a bail
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
form in paper and that is brought to the
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
court uh where if it's Superior Court it
 
05:26:23.230 --> 05:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
might be entered on an electronic docket
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
where you can see it if it's Circuit
 
05:26:26.110 --> 05:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
Court there's a notation that a bail
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
order exists but you can't see it and
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it says uh so that
 
05:26:30.240 --> 05:26:31.110 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it says uh so that
is

05:26:31.110 --> 05:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
an issue that we still have a highly as
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
many states do highly paper-based system
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
for a large number of cases and I think
 
05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
that was something that the committee uh
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
the policy committee noted impeded
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
communication on an individual who's
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
committing a series of crimes and
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
impeded the ability to get information
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
on their current bail conditions so the
 
05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
so The Upfront cost again you said
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
continuing it would be $300,000 a year
 
05:26:58.350 --> 05:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
what's the initial impact the high the
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
the highest impact is the 700,000 for
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
first year setup and then this is a
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
2-year contract so it has uh about
 
05:27:07.750 --> 05:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
700,000 for year 1 about 300,000 every
 
05:27:07.760 --> 05:27:08.548 align:start position:0%
700,000 for year 1 about 300,000 every
year

05:27:08.548 --> 05:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
thereafter um so that that's a part of
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
why the cost is so high for this this
 
05:27:14.990 --> 05:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
front end because we don't have the
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
system we'll have to create an interface
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
where a bail commissioner will be
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
instead of writing things on a paper
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
electronically entering into this
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
interface all of the data so that it
 
05:27:26.430 --> 05:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
lives there in real time so where did
 
05:27:29.548 --> 05:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
the $986,000 figure come from in the
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill this is the the vendor that we bid
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
it from okay yes and if we if we so that
 
05:27:37.310 --> 05:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
number can be lower than in the bill the
 
05:27:40.190 --> 05:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
986 I don't know if we can get a lower
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
Bill bid we can certainly put it to RFP
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
and see if a lower bid's available for
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety no this one the 986
 
05:27:49.110 --> 05:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
for uh sharing of individual Bill
 
05:27:49.120 --> 05:27:50.030 align:start position:0%
for uh sharing of individual Bill
condition

05:27:50.030 --> 05:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:27:52.510 --> 05:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
status right but it's together with that
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
no it's separate n 750 for state police
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
986 for judicial my understanding is
 
05:28:02.350 --> 05:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
that's for the whole system is is both
 
05:28:05.230 --> 05:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
of those this system involves two
 
05:28:08.830 --> 05:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
different areas the police and one's the
 
05:28:10.350 --> 05:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch one's the judicial
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
branch one's the state police but it's
 
05:28:15.390 --> 05:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
for the SI the same system yes it it is
 
05:28:17.310 --> 05:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
I think originally when uh this was
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
first discussed it it was only put to
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety what their cost
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be but without the information
 
05:28:23.548 --> 05:28:23.558 align:start position:0%
entered by bail Commissioners and the
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
courts it just wouldn't be complete and
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
so it was we were asked to give an
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would be for us to
 
05:28:30.430 --> 05:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
also be feeding into the system and so
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
the combined cost setup costs is about
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
1.7 million I I don't know what the
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
annual costs after that for the um
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety are but for the
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch they're under 300,000 a
 
05:28:43.868 --> 05:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
year after
 
05:28:43.878 --> 05:28:45.390 align:start position:0%
year after
that

05:28:45.390 --> 05:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:45.400 --> 05:28:46.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:49.788 --> 05:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
surek can you or maybe somebody behind
 
05:28:52.270 --> 05:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
answer my question about the NCC
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
database this gentlemen I
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
can thank you so ncic is a a federally
 
05:28:59.708 --> 05:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
administered database I I don't know
 
05:29:02.990 --> 05:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
what our ability is to to add Fields
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
but the what's contemplated is to make a
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
system that is exactly like our existing
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
bail order form but it is being filled
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
out electronically so instead of living
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
in paper it's going to live in an
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
electronic system I don't know whether
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's a way to compel the federal
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
system to to take a form like that or to
 
05:29:21.390 --> 05:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
process that as part of their
 
05:29:23.190 --> 05:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
information it's just not something I've
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
into further
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none but don't go
 
05:29:35.150 --> 05:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere I think um Rett McGuire I did
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
attempt to get some numbers for you uh
 
05:29:39.070 --> 05:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
could I ask if you could uh just repeat
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
your question so I make sure that I'm
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
giving you the correct numbers so how
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
many for the for the um cases that are
 
05:29:49.270 --> 05:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
being taken away from the bail
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners how many such cases are
 
05:29:56.430 --> 05:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
there every year uh based on 2021 data
 
05:29:56.440 --> 05:29:59.230 align:start position:0%
there every year uh based on 2021 data
that

05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.240 --> 05:30:05.310 align:start position:0%
 
is400

05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.628 --> 05:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
okay and the I think the average number
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
of people that see a bail commissioner
 
05:30:10.750 --> 05:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
in one way or the other is actually
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
exceeds 10,000 I think I thought it was
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
a little less than that it's actually
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
probably over 10,000 as I looked into it
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
all right so my math would say 1,400
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
cases 15 magistrates each one would do a
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
100 a year or two a week so that's not
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
very much work for a magistrate yeah I I
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
think if that were the only thing that
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
they were doing that would that would be
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
a very good point that may be something
 
05:30:35.788 --> 05:30:35.798 align:start position:0%
that the committee uh considered because
 
05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
I was looking I think it might be
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
249 that actually lays out more yes I
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
think it is 249 that also gives them the
 
05:30:46.310 --> 05:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
ability to issue search warrants hold a
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
hold arraignments and other preliminary
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and I think the thought with
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
that was that there's a potential cost
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
saving because a magistrate would be
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
less than a a Judicial officer to
 
05:30:57.470 --> 05:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
perform some of those functions uh in a
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
large Court arraignments are a full day
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
calendar every day has to be kind of
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
heard by a Judicial officer so I I think
 
05:31:05.030 --> 05:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're right if that were the only thing
 
05:31:06.430 --> 05:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
that magistrates were doing in addition
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
to training bail Commissioners and some
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
of the other responsibilities they've
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
been assigned in this package you you
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
could have an inefficiency there but I
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
think they their answer to that and of
 
05:31:15.390 --> 05:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
course they probably shouldn't be
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
speaking for them was to add some other
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
duties as well for a
 
05:31:20.830 --> 05:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
magistrate representa Sweeney thank you
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you again for being
 
05:31:24.230 --> 05:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
here not to throw a question to you with
 
05:31:25.868 --> 05:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
you might not have the number for right
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
now but for the existing judges that we
 
05:31:30.190 --> 05:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
do have obviously we don't have
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates what is their weekly
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
workload or case load that they deal
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
with that's a great question um I'd love
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
to send you if you wouldn't mind uh we
 
05:31:40.350 --> 05:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
had a we had a weighted case load study
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
done by the national Center for Cas uh
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
state courts which was really good we
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
knew we were busy but we didn't know how
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
to quantify it and they helpfully did um
 
05:31:51.310 --> 05:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
and what they did basically is separate
 
05:31:52.830 --> 05:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's a number of timelines in our
 
05:31:54.510 --> 05:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
statutes where uh the legislatur
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
determine that the court has to do
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
something in a certain period of time
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
and if we meet all of those deadlines
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything else goes into the second
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
bucket which is drastically
 
05:32:03.708 --> 05:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
underresourced um and I think we
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
determined we were about six or seven uh
 
05:32:08.830 --> 05:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
judges short to meet the the goals of
 
05:32:10.510 --> 05:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
that bucket and I know that there are
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
many legislators who have taken that up
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
and are working on that so I I don't
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
want to belabor that point um but at the
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
moment we're we're a little short on
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
judges thank you if I if I may Mr just
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
to add a comment I think there might be
 
05:32:25.270 --> 05:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
a healthy balance here with the the case
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
load that we can expect 1400 cases for
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
the magistrates there might be a formula
 
05:32:32.430 --> 05:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
we can figure out what the proper number
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
is based on that case load a year and
 
05:32:38.390 --> 05:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
Burg down by a week as to what existing
 
05:32:41.070 --> 05:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
judicial officers have to deal with
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
so and rep Sweeney may I may I burden
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
You by also responding to a question I
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
think you asked me earlier that I now
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
also ran down about the 848 number
 
05:32:51.548 --> 05:32:51.558 align:start position:0%
that's our total estimated annual unpaid
 
05:32:53.910 --> 05:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not that number decreased by an
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
expect expectation that half of that
 
05:32:57.510 --> 05:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be repaid that's the number that's
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
left over assuming that we're able to
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
pay everyone else it's it's more like
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
1.6 1.7 in total bail commissioner fees
 
05:33:06.390 --> 05:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a year that's what we're expecting we
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
need to pay to compensate all of the
 
05:33:10.350 --> 05:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill Commissioners who have an Indigent
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
defendant appear before
 
05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much now if we could
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
have someone from the Department of
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
there yes the young lady that's been
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
is it okay we have three oh absolutely
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
two chairs more and if you could all
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves if you have a
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
difficult last name spell it for our
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
Clerk and yes please use the mic yes my
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
name is Jennifer Hackett I am the
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
administrator 3 for the J1 program of
 
05:33:49.430 --> 05:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State
 
05:33:52.990 --> 05:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
Police my name is Jen Jessica mcfaden
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
that's Mac fad Zen MC fadson I'm the
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.708 --> 05:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
police I'm Jeff Leong I am the J1
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
technical lead for New Hampshire State
 
05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
Police so obviously you heard we had
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
some questions and one that comes to
 
05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
mind is that your department thought
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
there'd be some significant impact of
 
05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation so I'd kind of like to
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
boil it down to see significant in money
 
05:34:26.430 --> 05:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
or what it's all yours sure I believe
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
two areas that we would like to address
 
05:34:30.190 --> 05:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
first is two questions that were brought
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
up during the discussion around the NCC
 
05:34:35.470 --> 05:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
system itself and specifically around
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
the cost let's start with the NCC system
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
itself um I'm going to kick it over to
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
Jessica to clarify that because the
 
05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
system the way that's our spot system
 
05:34:47.788 --> 05:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
the way that it set up now will not
 
05:34:50.110 --> 05:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
allow us to retain that information and
 
05:34:53.230 --> 05:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
disseminate that information through NCC
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now and there's some
 
05:34:58.270 --> 05:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
regulations on why that can't happen and
 
05:34:59.830 --> 05:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
I'll let Jess go into further detail
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
detail on that just to clarify that for
 
05:35:06.350 --> 05:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you Jen um again when we talk
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
about the ncic system it contains 15
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
different persons files and the one that
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
you were referencing is actually
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
referred to as the protection order file
 
05:35:18.510 --> 05:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
that file was designed by the FBI and
 
05:35:20.670 --> 05:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
the entry criteria that were allowed to
 
05:35:23.548 --> 05:35:23.558 align:start position:0%
use to put information into that file is
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
only for those persons that have had a
 
05:35:28.548 --> 05:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
protection order issued against them so
 
05:35:30.750 --> 05:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
the only bail condition we can enter
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
into that file in the database would be
 
05:35:35.670 --> 05:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
those criminal bail orders that are
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
related to domestic violence related
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
offenses where the bail order becomes a
 
05:35:43.788 --> 05:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
domestic violence restraining order so
 
05:35:46.270 --> 05:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
any other bail orders that are issued
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
for any other crimes that are not DV
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
related would not meet the criteria
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
mandated by the FBI for us to enter into
 
05:35:56.430 --> 05:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
that protection order file and the other
 
05:35:58.910 --> 05:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
14 persons files that we have none of
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
them have cr criteria that allow for
 
05:36:03.310 --> 05:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
entry of anything related to bail
 
05:36:03.320 --> 05:36:06.830 align:start position:0%
entry of anything related to bail
conditions

05:36:06.830 --> 05:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.430 --> 05:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
either thank you thank you for coming
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's very useful
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
so how do we know somebody gets arrested
 
05:36:14.638 --> 05:36:15.868 align:start position:0%
so how do we know somebody gets arrested
in

05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester isn't the system there so
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
that they know this guy jumped bail in
 
05:36:25.270 --> 05:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
Atlanta or something like that no no the
 
05:36:27.868 --> 05:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
way the system is designed to work in
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
order to put somebody into any of the
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
those 15 files each file has its own
 
05:36:35.070 --> 05:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
specific criteria so in your example if
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an individual that
 
05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
jumped bail in Atlanta in order for them
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
to be entered into NCC they would have
 
05:36:44.670 --> 05:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
to meet one of the criteria for those 15
 
05:36:47.470 --> 05:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
files most likely in this case if we
 
05:36:49.708 --> 05:36:49.718 align:start position:0%
were going to see them in the database
 
05:36:51.270 --> 05:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
then someone in Atlanta would have had
 
05:36:53.548 --> 05:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
to have issued a warrant for them and
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
then they would go into the wanted
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
person file the fact that they're on
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
bail by itself would not meet crit IIA
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
for any of the files once they violate
 
05:37:05.310 --> 05:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
bail the agency that issued bail could
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
get a warrant and then that warrant
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
could be entered into the system where
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's available Nationwide I see so this
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
system is to find out they're on bail
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
now but they're still in in U compliance
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
with that bail right because the you
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
know the court case hasn't come up yet
 
05:37:25.830 --> 05:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
or something like that but that's
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
relevant to us because if you're already
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
on bail and now you commit another crime
 
05:37:33.948 --> 05:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
maybe your bail should be revoked is
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
that the idea yes that would be the idea
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay thank
 
05:37:41.230 --> 05:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:37:45.150 --> 05:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions represented grassy no
 
05:37:48.190 --> 05:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
Griffin cell
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
no all right um that question of cost
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes so I'd just like to address one
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
specific area around cost when we were
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
first approached and was speaking with
 
05:38:01.990 --> 05:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
the courts about this particular
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
initiative there were two different
 
05:38:06.190 --> 05:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
avenues that we could pursue the most
 
05:38:10.948 --> 05:38:10.958 align:start position:0%
coste effective and the most um the the
 
05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
the plan that would give us the most um
 
05:38:16.110 --> 05:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
accessibility excuse me to the
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
information is by having the judicial
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
branch um enhance their existing system
 
05:38:26.910 --> 05:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
by doing that J1 or ncic the only thing
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we are doing is we're building a
 
05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
hot file via NCC for that information to
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
travel from the court system into NCC to
 
05:38:39.628 --> 05:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
allow law enforcement to access that if
 
05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
we follow that pathway the cost for us
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
does drop in many ways and probably
 
05:38:49.230 --> 05:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
pretty significantly building a hot file
 
05:38:52.350 --> 05:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
is a little less cost prohibited so it
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
probably would only cost the state uh
 
05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police somewhere in
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
the range of
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to build that particular hot
 
05:39:01.948 --> 05:39:01.958 align:start position:0%
file because of the fact that we're not
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
building the forms in which the agencies
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
or the individuals would enter this
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
information so it does change that a
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
little bit um as far as the cost for
 
05:39:16.030 --> 05:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
that so you go down from 750 which the
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
bill highlighted from the state police
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
down to roughly 200 then correct okay
 
05:39:23.708 --> 05:39:23.718 align:start position:0%
thank you y that's very
 
05:39:25.868 --> 05:39:25.878 align:start position:0%
helpful one more
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
question I feel like Columbo here all
 
05:39:28.920 --> 05:39:30.510 align:start position:0%
question I feel like Columbo here all
right

05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:39:34.868 --> 05:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
um so let's let's talk let's explore how
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
useful this system would be right so
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're we we're thinking about a case
 
05:39:42.670 --> 05:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
where somebody goes out on bail they
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
enter it into the
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
system and later they get arrested for
 
05:39:47.680 --> 05:39:48.708 align:start position:0%
system and later they get arrested for
something

05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
else but currently we don't know because
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere else right it's not in
 
05:39:56.948 --> 05:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
both if both are in Manchester right now
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
we would know it presumably right but if
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
one of them's in nashille and one of
 
05:40:04.708 --> 05:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
them's in Manchester we wouldn't so um
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
So currently this second this person is
 
05:40:09.990 --> 05:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
arrested the second time is bailed out a
 
05:40:13.150 --> 05:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
second time um whereas with this system
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
they won't be bailed out the second time
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes all right so the question
 
05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
is how many times does it occur that
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
such a person currently commits a third
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
crime okay because this system will not
 
05:40:32.788 --> 05:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
prevent the first
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
two it will only prevent the third one
 
05:40:37.270 --> 05:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one and the fifth one
 
05:40:42.110 --> 05:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
like that do we know how many times that
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
happens what I can say is that I
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
specifically don't know the stats on how
 
05:40:49.868 --> 05:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
how often that happens Jess and Jeff I'm
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
not sure if whether or not either of you
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
have that information either but what I
 
05:40:56.070 --> 05:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
would say is we can also look at it from
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
this perspective of not necessarily how
 
05:40:58.920 --> 05:41:00.110 align:start position:0%
this perspective of not necessarily how
many

05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
but how law enforcement is able to react
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
to that person that they're now having
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
contact with because with that
 
05:41:09.628 --> 05:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
additional information they will be able
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
to see what the conditions are of that
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
person's bail so if they pull that
 
05:41:17.468 --> 05:41:17.478 align:start position:0%
person over and that person is violating
 
05:41:19.628 --> 05:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
any of those conditions they will then
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
know how to respond and without that
 
05:41:24.110 --> 05:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
information there's a kind of a gaping
 
05:41:26.788 --> 05:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
hole on exactly how to respond to that
 
05:41:29.548 --> 05:41:29.558 align:start position:0%
but the exact numbers of how frequent
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
that happens I don't have that
 
05:41:32.430 --> 05:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
information right now just from their
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
license plate or you mean so the query
 
05:41:38.590 --> 05:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
would be correct me if I'm wrong the
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
query would be spawned off of a license
 
05:41:44.350 --> 05:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
plate query yes okay yeah now this is
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
important for me because my my town had
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
an officer killed in a situation like
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
this right they pulled over somebody and
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
and got shot and they didn't know that

Commissioner elected Police Commissioner
 
05:42:30.920 --> 05:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
Commissioner elected Police Commissioner
in

05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um I've been working uh I've
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
been involved in the criminal legal
 
05:42:39.270 --> 05:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire for the last 43
 
05:42:42.430 --> 05:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
years um so for lack of better putting
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
it I've been around um I I also have
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
been involved in uh the bail issues ever
 
05:42:52.110 --> 05:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
since the original bail Reform Act
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
sponsored by uh Senator felus which uh I
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
authored that for Senator felus uh and
 
05:42:59.708 --> 05:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
I've been involved
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh in talking endlessly with members of
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
the House criminal justice Public Safety
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
Committee so this is something that
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
matters to me both as a police
 
05:43:11.948 --> 05:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner as a law professor and just
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
as a resident of New Hampshire there's a
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
a a bunch of pieces of questions that
 
05:43:20.270 --> 05:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
been asked that I think I can add some
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
additional light to so I apologize for
 
05:43:24.670 --> 05:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
Dr jumping around but uh part of the
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
part of the problem in terms of the the
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
the data and the money uh in uh s SP 252
 
05:43:33.708 --> 05:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
it starts to solve a a bigger systemic
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
problem the court system uh for reasons
 
05:43:40.910 --> 05:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
of money and history uh does not have a
 
05:43:43.150 --> 05:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
data collection system it has a case
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
management system so the court system uh
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
not intentionally by any means on their
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
part but just the way things are they
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many people who had
 
05:43:55.708 --> 05:43:55.718 align:start position:0%
bail set in two different cases and a
 
05:43:57.548 --> 05:43:57.558 align:start position:0%
third time get involved they can't give
 
05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
you that number not that they don't want
 
05:44:01.708 --> 05:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
to but they just can't because we need
 
05:44:04.990 --> 05:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
to spend you know separate issue for
 
05:44:06.990 --> 05:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the future sometime
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to put in place a
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
data collection system from the for the
 
05:44:13.708 --> 05:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
court system so uh that's the
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
overarching concern this money in SV 252
 
05:44:20.670 --> 05:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
is to create a smaller
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
system uh at least financially to cure
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
this problem represented by a case I
 
05:44:30.510 --> 05:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
wrote about uh in uh an oped piece in
 
05:44:33.628 --> 05:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
the union leader uh several months ago
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
an individual was arrested and charged
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
with attempted first-degree assault in
 
05:44:41.948 --> 05:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
hillsbor in Manchester uh he uh went in
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
front of a judge had a bail Hearing in
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
front of a judge and because it was a
 
05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
relatively weak case uh the judge set
 
05:44:51.788 --> 05:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail with some
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
conditions um that was in early July I
 
05:44:59.230 --> 05:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe in later July he was arrested uh
 
05:45:03.468 --> 05:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
in uh man Nashua for some misdemeanors
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
including uh refusing to leave a
 
05:45:10.310 --> 05:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
McDonald's as I recall uh and um that
 
05:45:10.320 --> 05:45:11.468 align:start position:0%
McDonald's as I recall uh and um that
bail

05:45:11.468 --> 05:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
bail
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
hearing the arraignment on those
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges was Poston till late
 
05:45:20.110 --> 05:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
August uh in late August he was arrested
 
05:45:24.430 --> 05:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
a third time on uh a bunch of additional
 
05:45:25.708 --> 05:45:25.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors in
 
05:45:29.788 --> 05:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
nashaa um at the bail Hearing in in late
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
August early
 
05:45:33.910 --> 05:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
September the prosecutor who was arguing
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
bail on that
 
05:45:37.948 --> 05:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
case didn't mention a word about him
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
being out on personal recognizance bail
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
on the first attempted first-degree
 
05:45:44.750 --> 05:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
assault it never come up likely she
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
didn't know about
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
it uh and the prior Manchester CH the
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester charges that happen in Late
 
05:45:54.190 --> 05:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
July those didn't come up either nor did
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor uh on the original
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
attempted first-degree assault
 
05:46:03.948 --> 05:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
cases apparently notied that these two
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent sets of arrests had occurred
 
05:46:09.390 --> 05:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and Nashua uh so that
 
05:46:11.868 --> 05:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
prosecutor uh did not file a motion to
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
revoke Veil on the attempted
 
05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault the reason I bring
 
05:46:18.590 --> 05:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
this case up is in uh within a week of
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
that bail hearing where the person was
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
again released on PR bail uh he
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
allegedly uh killed an individual in
 
05:46:27.798 --> 05:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
allegedly uh killed an individual in
Manchester

05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
originally as uh you know as as things
 
05:46:36.390 --> 05:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
happen some in the news media went
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
ballistic and said this is why we need
 
05:46:41.548 --> 05:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
to change the bail system well the truth
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
was we didn't there were plenty of
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the bail statute as it was
 
05:46:49.110 --> 05:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with this guy the first time he
 
05:46:50.910 --> 05:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
was arrested on misdemeanors after the
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
original felony bail was set but nobody
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
knew about it this problem was the
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
communication of the bail status of that
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
individual once his bail was Set uh
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
person PR bail was set in the attempted
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
first-degree murder apparently nobody
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
nobody who was paying was Prosecuting
 
05:47:14.310 --> 05:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the first set of additional
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or the second set of
 
05:47:17.948 --> 05:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
additional Meers knew about it so they
 
05:47:19.468 --> 05:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
didn't raise it he clearly would have
 
05:47:23.948 --> 05:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
been held by any judge uh that's why
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
this system is
 
05:47:30.468 --> 05:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
important um because it it it tries to
 
05:47:34.468 --> 05:47:34.478 align:start position:0%
create it will create a system where
 
05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
when somebody is put on bail it
 
05:47:39.548 --> 05:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
instantly goes into a system and
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:47:43.150 --> 05:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
knows about it every prosecutor every
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
police officer knows about and for that
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
matter the way the system's going to be
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
set up every defense lawyer knows about
 
05:47:51.390 --> 05:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
it too um that's what this is
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
about uh to to cure that problem um it's
 
05:47:59.548 --> 05:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
it feels expensive in the short term in
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
the setup money but uh it's uh boy is it
 
05:48:03.680 --> 05:48:04.468 align:start position:0%
the setup money but uh it's uh boy is it
worth

05:48:04.468 --> 05:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
worth
 
05:48:07.230 --> 05:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
it um you know
 
05:48:09.270 --> 05:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
arguably I don't think I'm overstating
 
05:48:11.948 --> 05:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
it there will be one less person who is
 
05:48:11.958 --> 05:48:12.750 align:start position:0%
it there will be one less person who is
now

05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
deceased with this system and know let's
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
not go to the philosophical debate of
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
how how much it's worth a system to do
 
05:48:24.510 --> 05:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
that um so that's uh that's what that's
 
05:48:26.270 --> 05:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
all about and that's why the money's
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
there significant startup cost no doubt
 
05:48:35.310 --> 05:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
about that um uh in terms of um the
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
magistrate judges uh I I I you know I
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
work I was at almost every single
 
05:48:43.468 --> 05:48:43.478 align:start position:0%
hearing that house criminal justice
 
05:48:45.868 --> 05:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
Public Safety held from September to
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
November uh you know three months of
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
hearings and every stakeholder that we
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
could scare up had an opportunity to
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
testify and what we heard over and over
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
again particularly from the Manchester
 
05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
Police Department was we don't want to
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
keep going in front of bail
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they keep screwing things
 
05:49:05.190 --> 05:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
up we want these people on these serious
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
crimes to go in front of
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
judges and that was a major impetus for
 
05:49:16.110 --> 05:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
the magistrate system and we as we
 
05:49:18.430 --> 05:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
started to think about it I apologize
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
for this um as we started to think about
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
it as a committee started to think about
 
05:49:25.310 --> 05:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
it uh and we're talking about it you
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
know there as uh the representative from
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
the court system testified there's
 
05:49:32.350 --> 05:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of additional benefits to
 
05:49:34.468 --> 05:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
having these magistrate judges that go
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
beyond sitting as judges on uh as more
 
05:49:41.468 --> 05:49:41.478 align:start position:0%
substantial uh uh judges there's a
 
05:49:46.110 --> 05:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that they be lawyers uh um
 
05:49:48.788 --> 05:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
they can they can uh do search warrants
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh they can do arraignments you know it
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
it helps manage the Court's overwhelming
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
case load at this point particularly at
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
the circuit court level or the district
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
court level where uh the legislature has
 
05:50:04.270 --> 05:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
sent has gotten rid of what's called
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
felonies first so probable cause
 
05:50:10.350 --> 05:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
hearings and felonies if they were going
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
to occur had been occurring in Superior
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
Court they're now be they weren't having
 
05:50:18.468 --> 05:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
probable course cause hearings up there
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
they're now going back they've been in
 
05:50:23.468 --> 05:50:23.478 align:start position:0%
circuit court now since January first a
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
lot more case load for for district
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
court judges so the the the Magistrate
 
05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
Judge is judges are not just a one-off
 
05:50:33.190 --> 05:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
to get rid of those damn bail
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I I really encourage you
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
not to think about it that way it really
 
05:50:41.310 --> 05:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
stabilizes in important ways a lot about
 
05:50:43.390 --> 05:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
the court system which has been
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by a host of changes over
 
05:50:49.590 --> 05:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
the last several years
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
um electronic monitoring uh I point out
 
05:50:56.270 --> 05:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
that the cost that straford county is is
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
incurring for electronic monitoring is
 
05:51:00.510 --> 05:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
for they have a pre-trial Services
 
05:51:03.468 --> 05:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
Program because they're uh for these
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
purposes they're a wealthy County
 
05:51:07.548 --> 05:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
because they house a lot of federal
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
inmates and make a lot of money off of
 
05:51:12.510 --> 05:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
that as chesher county is now doing uh
 
05:51:13.948 --> 05:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
and they're starting to have a pre-trial
 
05:51:17.070 --> 05:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
Services Program so but the people who
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
are getting electronic monitoring
 
05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
straford County go well
 
05:51:26.110 --> 05:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
beyond those who have had a protective
 
05:51:29.948 --> 05:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
order placed on them this legislation
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
only has it only accounts for electronic
 
05:51:35.788 --> 05:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
monitoring for people who have a
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
protective order against them it's a
 
05:51:41.110 --> 05:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored thing so uh just
 
05:51:43.788 --> 05:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
be cautious about extrapolating from
 
05:51:47.468 --> 05:51:47.478 align:start position:0%
straber county numbers uh Statewide you
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
know I because I think it's a small
 
05:51:52.468 --> 05:51:52.478 align:start position:0%
subset if any of those stford County
 
05:51:55.230 --> 05:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
cases were protective order cases which
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
is what the only thing that this uh uh
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
249 is it 249 we're talking
 
05:52:05.110 --> 05:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
about 250 uh yeah 252 excuse me that
 
05:52:06.350 --> 05:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's all that
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
252 uh talks about um let me I apologize
 
05:52:12.320 --> 05:52:13.390 align:start position:0%
252 uh talks about um let me I apologize
uh

05:52:13.390 --> 05:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
for uh just as a backdrop to what the uh
 
05:52:19.270 --> 05:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice Public Safety
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
understood there's some data coming out
 
05:52:24.190 --> 05:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
of hearings uh that I and others
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
attended several years ago involving the
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
office of of Cost Containment which is
 
05:52:32.670 --> 05:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to this discussion except out
 
05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
of that hearing came the information
 
05:52:39.230 --> 05:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
from uh the criminal justice system uh
 
05:52:41.310 --> 05:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
both from then chief justice Netto and
 
05:52:42.750 --> 05:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
from the director of the public defender
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
program that somewhere between 25% 25
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
and 35% of all misdemeanors and felonies
 
05:52:51.628 --> 05:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
for which Council was appointed were
 
05:52:54.030 --> 05:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
either the finding was either not guilty
 
05:52:55.990 --> 05:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
or they were completely
 
05:53:00.070 --> 05:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
dismissed so this issue of bail is you
 
05:53:05.070 --> 05:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
know making sure we don't incarcerate
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
people too many people we don't ER in
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
the direction of over incarcerating
 
05:53:13.230 --> 05:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial is really significant when you
 
05:53:16.150 --> 05:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
contemplate that say 20 25% of those
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
people who might be held might be held
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh and are later found not guilty or
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
their case dismissed I think that's an
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
important context
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm done I apologize for taking so
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
long presenta Maguire thank you Mr
 
05:53:41.708 --> 05:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Professor for
 
05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
coming um I want to push back slightly
 
05:53:47.468 --> 05:53:47.478 align:start position:0%
on your first example of the fellow who
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
was um arraigned on on attempted murder
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
and then later attemped first degree
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
assault what whatever it was okay and
 
05:54:00.270 --> 05:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
then later this and or that and so on um
 
05:54:02.510 --> 05:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
the way I understand the Court's
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
database is it's called Odyssey and it's
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
essentially a filing cabinet with a
 
05:54:11.708 --> 05:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
folder for each person and in the folder
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
is scanned copies of all the paper that
 
05:54:16.750 --> 05:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
has come in on this person right So
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
eventually scanned right so so when they
 
05:54:22.310 --> 05:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
were put on bail in the first place by
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
the first judge that piece of paper
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
would get scanned it would be in the
 
05:54:28.510 --> 05:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
folder in theory it would would be
 
05:54:33.070 --> 05:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
unclear at what time that's right so so
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
either in your in your example was it
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
was the time too narrow or was it error
 
05:54:42.830 --> 05:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
on the part of the prosecutor in the
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
second case just to not look in the
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
folder and not read every piece of paper
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
that was on the folder you see what I
 
05:54:51.030 --> 05:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
mean oh I understand what I understand
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
what you're asking and you know um I
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in the criminal
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
justice system in New Hampshire
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
forever and uh I've seen every possible
 
05:55:05.070 --> 05:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
kind of error made except for the next
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
new one that's made I mean it really you
 
05:55:11.350 --> 05:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
know so uh you know I was I was a public
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
defender for 13 years um and so you know
 
05:55:17.070 --> 05:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
back when I was a public defender I was
 
05:55:18.590 --> 05:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
more than prone to say well it's the
 
05:55:21.310 --> 05:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
damn Prosecutor's fault you know uh but
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
or you know every so often if I could
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
get away with it without pissing the
 
05:55:26.310 --> 05:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
judge off it's the damn judge's fault
 
05:55:27.628 --> 05:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
you never you never said it was the
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
clerk's fall cuz then you're in trouble
 
05:55:33.070 --> 05:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know it could have been any
 
05:55:34.548 --> 05:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
of those things it could have been the
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
information didn't get in the system it
 
05:55:40.270 --> 05:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
could have been an overworked prosecutor
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
in those offices who didn't have time to
 
05:55:44.830 --> 05:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
look at that it could be a lazy
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
prosecutor uh it could be some a
 
05:55:49.468 --> 05:55:49.478 align:start position:0%
prosecutor who's got a lot of experience
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
and knows that well it's never worth
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's not worth checking cuz nothing ever
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
comes of it you know we it's not going
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
to it's not going to make make the
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
system perfect because you know the good
 
05:56:02.628 --> 05:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
thing and the bad thing about the
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is we still
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
depend on people um and so you know it's
 
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
still going to be the case no matter how
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
accessible and instantly accessible it
 
05:56:15.270 --> 05:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
is emphasis on instantly accessible it
 
05:56:17.310 --> 05:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
is people are still going to screw up
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
but boy I don't think what happened in
 
05:56:22.030 --> 05:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester or the case I described would
 
05:56:24.350 --> 05:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
have happened if this system were in
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
place thank
 
05:56:26.878 --> 05:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
place thank
you

05:56:38.788 --> 05:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
I remind everyone we try to be I'll be
 
05:56:41.670 --> 05:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
quick I promise I'm straford count okay
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
so we try to focus on the uh Financial
 
05:56:46.990 --> 05:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
issues here in finance and not so much
 
05:56:49.070 --> 05:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
policy but some policy information is
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
good I'm I'm really not here to to talk
 
05:56:53.708 --> 05:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
about the merits of the bill at all but
 
05:56:55.510 --> 05:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
just simply to provide you the financial
 
05:56:57.910 --> 05:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
information which we're pass which we
 
05:57:00.910 --> 05:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
passing out now um I I do want to say
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing pre-trial we could
 
05:57:05.708 --> 05:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
have your name the record sorry my name
 
05:57:09.948 --> 05:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
is Raymond Bower b w r uh and I'm the
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
County Administrator but I also um
 
05:57:15.788 --> 05:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
originated the pre-trial program uh we
 
05:57:18.868 --> 05:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
currently monitor 571 people in the
 
05:57:22.230 --> 05:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
community and 80 incarcerated in the
 
05:57:24.190 --> 05:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
house of correction so give you an idea
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's about six or seven to one in the
 
05:57:28.708 --> 05:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
community uh 73 of those
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
people are on electronic monitoring for
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
a whole variety of reasons and the
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
professor's correct that uh only a
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
portion of which uh is for domestic
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
violence related issues the nice part
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
about about electronic monitoring for
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
domestic violence related issues is you
 
05:57:50.830 --> 05:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
can put zones into the uh electronic
 
05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring and those zones um if there's
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
a violation of that zone um it will be
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
reported but you're right we do have a
 
05:58:01.040 --> 05:58:02.190 align:start position:0%
reported but you're right we do have a
whole

05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
whole
 
05:58:06.310 --> 05:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
pre-trial uh segment obviously to watch
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
571 people and it's for a whole variety
 
05:58:12.830 --> 05:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
of Criminal Justice uh related issues um
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
everything from uh habitual offender
 
05:58:20.430 --> 05:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
information to uh child support
 
05:58:22.990 --> 05:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
information to everything and the goal
 
05:58:25.548 --> 05:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
is to keep people out of jail that don't
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
need to be there and it's a significant
 
05:58:33.070 --> 05:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh 175 people that we monitor are people
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
that are mentally ill um so that we
 
05:58:40.030 --> 05:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't uh flood our nothing's to me more
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
sinful than to incarcerate someone who's
 
05:58:44.190 --> 05:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime primarily because
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
they're mentally ill so um the last page
 
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
the first two pages of the handout
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
really are the every time someone is
 
05:58:57.390 --> 05:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
brought into the jail before they uh and
 
05:59:00.030 --> 05:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has decided to set some
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
form of conditions that doesn't allow
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
them to be released immediately meaning
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
arraignment I have an employee that goes
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
in and interviews the specific person
 
05:59:18.150 --> 05:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
face tace and then takes time to check
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
on the information that that person
 
05:59:22.590 --> 05:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
provides obviously they can't check
 
05:59:24.910 --> 05:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
every single thing but they check the
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
pertinent things uh so that this can
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
then be presented to the judge at the
 
05:59:32.070 --> 05:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
time of arraignment and the judge can
 
05:59:35.070 --> 05:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
use that information to make a more
 
05:59:37.948 --> 05:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
informed Veil determination which could
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
very well include them being ordered to
 
05:59:40.080 --> 05:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
very well include them being ordered to
our

05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:59:44.670 --> 05:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
program the second document that I have
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
we I've passed out is actually a new
 
05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
assessment form U the first one is is
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
called the um color Colorado risk
 
05:59:56.350 --> 05:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
assessment form the second one is one
 
05:59:58.270 --> 05:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's been piloted
 
06:00:00.510 --> 06:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
probably a million cases now across the
 
06:00:03.150 --> 06:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
United States um
 
06:00:06.990 --> 06:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
for more actually more inclined to weed
 
06:00:10.190 --> 06:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
out violent offenders and offenders who
 
06:00:14.670 --> 06:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
have uh skipped from previous uh Court
 
06:00:14.680 --> 06:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
have uh skipped from previous uh Court
obligations

06:00:16.230 --> 06:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it's also a relatively simple form
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
um and it's ad it's recommended by the
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
national pre-trial assessment
 
06:00:26.520 --> 06:00:28.750 align:start position:0%
national pre-trial assessment
Association

06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
Association
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
so in the last page is um we currently
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
have 70 as of March 1st 77 people on
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring last year we had
 
06:00:45.030 --> 06:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
234 uh total people costs um are listed
 
06:00:49.230 --> 06:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
there uh we charge $100 per week however
 
06:00:52.548 --> 06:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
if no one if no one is eliminated from
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the program if they can't afford it we
 
06:00:58.350 --> 06:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
allow them to uh work in our community
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
work program which uh if they work for
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
eight hours which could be anything I'll
 
06:01:05.948 --> 06:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
give you an example now we're helping
 
06:01:07.830 --> 06:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
Special Olympics that's our adopted
 
06:01:10.750 --> 06:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
charity so we're uh getting ready for
 
06:01:13.150 --> 06:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
the Winnie dip this coming weekend and
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
they can come and help us set up for the
 
06:01:17.270 --> 06:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
wiy dip they're supervised by
 
06:01:20.468 --> 06:01:20.478 align:start position:0%
correctional officers and they can earn
 
06:01:24.270 --> 06:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
$120 credit off of this bill for working
 
06:01:26.948 --> 06:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
one eight hour day so you know our goal
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
is not to tremendously burden the
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer U uh straford County taxpayer
 
06:01:36.830 --> 06:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
in in this um a lot of what's been
 
06:01:39.628 --> 06:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
focused on is providing information to
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety uh indicating
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
State Police State Police have almost no
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
involvement in this program so I simply
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
ask that if that is something that this
 
06:01:52.910 --> 06:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee is seriously considering that
 
06:01:55.270 --> 06:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
you give a lot more than the department
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
of safety access to this information
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh obviously would be of tremendous
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
value to us although I'd like to think
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
that we rarely miss someone who's out on
 
06:02:09.628 --> 06:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
a previous uh pre-trial situation
 
06:02:10.910 --> 06:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
especially if they're from straford
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
County because we interview every single
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
person um and I'd be happy to answer any
 
06:02:19.708 --> 06:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
questions repres quick represent Maguire
 
06:02:22.468 --> 06:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
thank you so do you think you're
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
presumably uh this is costing you
 
06:02:28.230 --> 06:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
roughly uh $500 a case it looks like if
 
06:02:32.310 --> 06:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're spending 118,000 for 234
 
06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
cases um do you feel like doing this is
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
much cheaper than somebody in jail is
 
06:02:40.990 --> 06:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
that the idea oh much cheaper I mean
 
06:02:43.310 --> 06:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
that this $500 a case somebody could be
 
06:02:45.788 --> 06:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
on an electronic monitoring for months
 
06:02:49.350 --> 06:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
right um and and although I will tell is
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
jail like a 100 a day 100 a week not not
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
in my jail okay we're we're $79.89 and
 
06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that includes depre apption of the
 
06:03:00.830 --> 06:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
building and everything so it's not just
 
06:03:04.030 --> 06:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
an operating cost per day it per day
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I um and we I know that for a fact
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
because we as it was pointed out we do
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
board federal inmates and we need to
 
06:03:15.070 --> 06:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
quantify those costs in order to uh get
 
06:03:17.110 --> 06:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
a rate set by the feds for the inmates
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
that we board for them so I'm positive
 
06:03:21.628 --> 06:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
number any further questions see none
 
06:03:27.150 --> 06:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
wait I have a really represent what's
 
06:03:30.430 --> 06:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
the the uh lifespan of an electric
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring unit um really it's
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
indefinite um as long as the battery's
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
charged and that's part of the
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
requirement you know is is that the the
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
person keeps the battery
 
06:03:46.270 --> 06:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
charged you know they just need to plug
 
06:03:47.830 --> 06:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
themselves in basically it's like your
 
06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
phone you need to plug yourself in
 
06:03:51.788 --> 06:03:51.798 align:start position:0%
obviously the most con a lot of times
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
there's curfew set um so they can plug
 
06:03:56.910 --> 06:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
they can plug themselves in during their
 
06:03:59.548 --> 06:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
Reg curfew
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
time and if you don't have a house we'll
 
06:04:04.110 --> 06:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
we'll find you a place to live we'll
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
provide you one if that's the only
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
reason you're incarcerated is you don't
 
06:04:10.750 --> 06:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
have a reliable residence to go to we
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
run a um we have about 30 beds in for
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
men and women obviously separately um
 
06:04:23.070 --> 06:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
that uh we provide and a number of the
 
06:04:25.708 --> 06:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
people that we house there are are
 
06:04:28.830 --> 06:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
people that have no access to permanent
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
housing um which is one of the
 
06:04:32.628 --> 06:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
requirements of the program certainly we
 
06:04:34.990 --> 06:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
need to know where they
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
are all right well thank you very much
 
06:04:39.868 --> 06:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
and before you go representative Muse I
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a quick
 
06:04:45.868 --> 06:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you thanks a good
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
job repres grassy would not allowing me
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do anything less I assure you he
 
06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
keeps a tight leash on all of us here so
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
so hopefully this will be a a quick
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
question with a quick answer so in 252
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
it makes reference for instance on page
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
two the decision of bail shall be made
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
by a magistrate within 24 hours of
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
arrest that's on line seven and 8 but
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's no Financial note for that but
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
but in the document which is helpful you
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
gave us on Senate Bill 249 it talks
 
06:05:35.390 --> 06:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
about the 15 magistrates so if 249
 
06:05:39.510 --> 06:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass and how does 252
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
work it's a good
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
question I'm just kind of curious why
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
maybe they weren't combined so you'd
 
06:05:51.150 --> 06:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
have the magistrates at 252 has in it as
 
06:05:54.190 --> 06:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
reference for bail are covered in cost
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
so it just seems like we're going to
 
06:06:00.070 --> 06:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
have to try to Mel them together or well
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
part of the uh part of the compromise
 
06:06:05.510 --> 06:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
process is trusting the Judgment of your
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
chair in terms of how things should be
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
arranged in the bills that are part of
 
06:06:13.350 --> 06:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
the compromise um I think things are are
 
06:06:16.990 --> 06:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
the way they are uh because um in his
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
judgment and I don't want to speak for
 
06:06:19.990 --> 06:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
him but but I think in his judgment he
 
06:06:21.468 --> 06:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
thought it was the most effective way to
 
06:06:24.430 --> 06:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
move forward uh with the bill so all
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
right well thank you that's all I have
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you all for oh I'm sorry just
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.190 --> 06:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
please we're going to hold you to two
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
minutes representative Maguire is not
 
06:06:40.590 --> 06:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask a question either
 
06:06:43.390 --> 06:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
so so if you could see that's
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but my name is Pat suin I'm
 
06:06:47.390 --> 06:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
the executive director for the New
 
06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
police I'm retired police chief from
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
gtown um currently still employed in law
 
06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement for over 42 years now
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
um with that I'd like to thank chairman
 
06:07:02.910 --> 06:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
Lesman and committee members for
 
06:07:05.230 --> 06:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
entertaining me uh a couple of things
 
06:07:07.868 --> 06:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
this bill reform is a huge priority for
 
06:07:10.350 --> 06:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs Association and we support
 
06:07:11.468 --> 06:07:11.478 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly um it surgically
 
06:07:16.270 --> 06:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
reinstates the 13 most egregious
 
06:07:21.310 --> 06:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
offenses um for bail um and that we
 
06:07:24.310 --> 06:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
feel that the money it's obviously an
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
issue but at what point do we
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
place money above Public Safety and we
 
06:07:32.150 --> 06:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
can debate all day long about the
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman in Manchester and the uh
 
06:07:34.920 --> 06:07:36.430 align:start position:0%
gentleman in Manchester and the uh
release

06:07:36.430 --> 06:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
release
 
06:07:39.868 --> 06:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
Etc but we need to protect the
 
06:07:42.030 --> 06:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
public that should be about two minutes
 
06:07:44.430 --> 06:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if you have them
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
well there's like 30 seconds left so
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
represent you have a question okay no
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendments not yet thank
 
06:07:57.070 --> 06:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you all very much uh we'll
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
close the work session on
 
06:08:01.150 --> 06:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
252 I don't believe we're going to make
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
a decision today but we will have
 
06:08:04.910 --> 06:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
another work session which will be
 
06:08:10.590 --> 06:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
calendar does does anyone need a quick
 
06:08:15.030 --> 06:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
five minute
 
06:08:18.430 --> 06:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
break uh represent grassy absolutely
 
06:08:23.830 --> 06:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:28.868 --> 06:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
see did a good job you did a good
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.190 --> 06:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:09:14.110 align:start position:0%
 
why

06:09:14.110 --> 06:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:18.190 --> 06:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
so you said that 249 was completely
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
revamped but are the 15 magistrates
 
06:09:25.468 --> 06:09:25.478 align:start position:0%
in9 yes but in a very weird way and also
 
06:12:48.830 --> 06:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:50.830 --> 06:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll call the work
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
session back
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
together so we have House Bill 1178
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
relative to an employees unused earned
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
time this came out of the committee
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
labor committee 1010 with no
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation or unanimous
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation anyway it was uh on the
 
06:13:10.520 --> 06:13:11.510 align:start position:0%
recommendation anyway it was uh on the
house

06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
floor uh as amended and the vote was 199
 
06:13:15.680 --> 06:13:17.190 align:start position:0%
floor uh as amended and the vote was 199
to

06:13:17.190 --> 06:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
179 and then the bill as amended passed
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
on a Voice vote on the 24th of
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
February um representative Cahill if you
 
06:13:29.310 --> 06:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself for our committee
 
06:13:31.150 --> 06:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon members of the
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael kahill I
 
06:13:35.788 --> 06:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of newfields and New
 
06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
Market in Rockingham
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
10 and uh this is not a new this is not
 
06:13:45.070 --> 06:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
a new idea this uh legislation we've
 
06:13:47.350 --> 06:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
talked about it before but there are a
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
couple of differences which I think are
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
relevant um as in the document I I I
 
06:13:56.830 --> 06:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
provided uh a key difference was that
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill last year HB 74 had a
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
language that it would be applied if the
 
06:14:05.468 --> 06:14:05.478 align:start position:0%
employee left in good standing that is
 
06:14:08.110 --> 06:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
they gave notice work their notice
 
06:14:10.030 --> 06:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps helped train the replacement you
 
06:14:11.948 --> 06:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
know any things that people like to do
 
06:14:14.110 --> 06:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
out of courtesy and it works good for
 
06:14:16.590 --> 06:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee but I
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
removed that because that was an
 
06:14:20.390 --> 06:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
impediment for for some and the other
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
body so uh it is an issue where you know
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
it does happen I provided some some
 
06:14:29.070 --> 06:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
information about how frequently uh
 
06:14:33.430 --> 06:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
claims involving uh um unused and unpaid
 
06:14:36.510 --> 06:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
vacation turn up in wage claims it
 
06:14:39.270 --> 06:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
impacts uh if you if you lay someone off
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
or they and they you don't them their U
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
week or two vacation uh the first thing
 
06:14:47.468 --> 06:14:47.478 align:start position:0%
they do is collect unemployment which
 
06:14:49.708 --> 06:14:49.718 align:start position:0%
affects the the unemployment trust fund
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'd like to protect that in the House
 
06:14:51.840 --> 06:14:52.708 align:start position:0%
we'd like to protect that in the House
labor

06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
labor
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee so you know there are some
 
06:14:57.310 --> 06:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
impacts and plus the the idea the person
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
who had earned this vacation time and
 
06:15:01.910 --> 06:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
now it vanishes through no fault of
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
their own uh they don't have you know if
 
06:15:06.830 --> 06:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
they go and file for unemployment it may
 
06:15:08.830 --> 06:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
take a week or two to get that to happen
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then they they're lucky if they get
 
06:15:14.350 --> 06:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
60% of their pay so it's a significant
 
06:15:16.670 --> 06:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
event the person may may begin to run up
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
their credit card bills may fall behind
 
06:15:21.310 --> 06:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
on the rent this is It's a societal
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
impact and basically I I think that many
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
employers would do this without being
 
06:15:28.430 --> 06:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
told by the
 
06:15:30.990 --> 06:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
legislature but it's unfortunate that
 
06:15:34.030 --> 06:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
some won't and so that is this this
 
06:15:36.070 --> 06:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
really is for those people that that
 
06:15:38.670 --> 06:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
don't do it and that leave people you
 
06:15:42.350 --> 06:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
know with you know a few hundred dollars
 
06:15:43.868 --> 06:15:43.878 align:start position:0%
that would have made a difference at the
 
06:15:46.150 --> 06:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
end of their employment and now it's now
 
06:15:48.270 --> 06:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's gone it's not there and I've I've
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
given you examples of that happening uh
 
06:15:53.628 --> 06:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
the scenario where the companies changed
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
hands and the people stayed on working
 
06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the new employer but they each lost
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
several hundred in vacation time that
 
06:16:04.590 --> 06:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
just vanished uh another example I think
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
as proud of serus is a a person was laid
 
06:16:09.708 --> 06:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
off without notice which is how it
 
06:16:12.830 --> 06:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
usually happens and she had I think it
 
06:16:12.840 --> 06:16:13.708 align:start position:0%
usually happens and she had I think it
was

06:16:13.708 --> 06:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
$2,300 in earned vacation that
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
disappeared and this was because uh she
 
06:16:22.510 --> 06:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
was not able to request the vacation
 
06:16:24.788 --> 06:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
time in two weeks with two weeks advance
 
06:16:27.030 --> 06:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
notice which if you're laid off with no
 
06:16:29.830 --> 06:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
notice it's you can't it's impossible
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's a catch 22 so we talked about the
 
06:16:35.468 --> 06:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
policy issue which the labor committee
 
06:16:38.548 --> 06:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh did not agree on but the uh the the
 
06:16:40.830 --> 06:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
the house certainly did as it has
 
06:16:44.350 --> 06:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
several times in the past now uh I also
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
gave you document about uh I found this
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Business Review
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday looking beyond the pink slips
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
of layoffs and that talks about how
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
layoffs uh also negatively impact the
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
company those who stay behind may not be
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
the best that that are staying behind
 
06:17:04.230 --> 06:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're not there to the people
 
06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
who left aren't there to help restore
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
the business so layoffs are bad for
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
business they're bad for employees
 
06:17:13.628 --> 06:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
really to be avoided but again when you
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
lay someone off and you say well I I
 
06:17:18.310 --> 06:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay your vacation time
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's like another kick in the pants
 
06:17:22.788 --> 06:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
and let's not let's not keep doing that
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh I do want to be straight with you uh
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the f note and and my my good friend
 
06:17:31.030 --> 06:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
David J brought this to my attention
 
06:17:33.070 --> 06:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
there is there was an error in the
 
06:17:35.990 --> 06:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill that passed
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
and my intent is to when we go to the
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
other body ask them please and thank you
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
to fix it I do have a a a short phrase
 
06:17:47.948 --> 06:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
that will fix it but the uh in in an
 
06:17:51.230 --> 06:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
effort to to make to appease the people
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
who sometimes have like seasonal workers
 
06:17:58.030 --> 06:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
and lay them on for this winter they're
 
06:18:00.190 --> 06:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
not going to pave roads or whatever it
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
is and then they there was reluctance to
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
pay them the vacation time when the
 
06:18:07.190 --> 06:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
intent is to have them come back when
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know spring is over you know spring
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
is back so in effort to do that I
 
06:18:15.110 --> 06:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
inserted some language uh about the uh
 
06:18:18.110 --> 06:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
layoff with no reasonable Assurance of
 
06:18:20.830 --> 06:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
the employee returning however there was
 
06:18:23.628 --> 06:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
an error there because uh it leaves the
 
06:18:25.350 --> 06:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
impression that if you lay someone if
 
06:18:27.510 --> 06:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
you fire someone for cause or they quit
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
they also get the vacation pay and that
 
06:18:32.030 --> 06:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
was not my intent uh unfortunately when
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about something and
 
06:18:36.110 --> 06:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
trying to fix it you sort of Miss the
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
forest for the trees so uh upon getting
 
06:18:41.868 --> 06:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
this to the other body I will ask uh
 
06:18:43.310 --> 06:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the other in that other
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
smaller chamber to fix that I'll provide
 
06:18:49.150 --> 06:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
the language uh which uh it was straight
 
06:18:52.190 --> 06:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
away just clear that right up I didn't
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
want to EMB burden you with that or I
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:59.868 --> 06:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
can I me take any
 
06:19:02.708 --> 06:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
questions are
 
06:19:05.030 --> 06:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative evil where
 
06:19:08.830 --> 06:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
is the error in the bill itself um okay
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
um not withstanding RSA
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
275 43 Roman
 
06:19:17.830 --> 06:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
5 18 it looks I don't have the lines
 
06:19:17.840 --> 06:19:18.788 align:start position:0%
5 18 it looks I don't have the lines
here

06:19:18.788 --> 06:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:19:21.670 --> 06:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
sorry all right so if an employee is
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
separated from an employer as defined in
 
06:19:28.430 --> 06:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 275 col 35a which by the way is new
 
06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
created in this bill uh because the
 
06:19:32.670 --> 06:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
employer's business closed changed
 
06:19:35.788 --> 06:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
ownership or what it says there is
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
because their employment ended with no
 
06:19:40.030 --> 06:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable Assurance of the employee
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
being able to return to set employee
 
06:19:45.310 --> 06:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
this is where the fix would be uh we
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
cross out strike out because their
 
06:19:51.150 --> 06:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
employment ended and replace that with
 
06:19:54.030 --> 06:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
due to a layoff so it will say due to a
 
06:20:07.788 --> 06:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
Assurance are there further
 
06:20:14.510 --> 06:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions I do have a couple of my own
 
06:20:16.750 --> 06:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
now looking at your the document you
 
06:20:19.750 --> 06:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
gave us uh dated
 
06:20:23.628 --> 06:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
today you have five bullet points has
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
sold the business closed the business
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
has laid off what if someone
 
06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
quits they don't get they don't get
 
06:20:33.070 --> 06:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
their vacation pay or they don't have to
 
06:20:36.070 --> 06:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
under the law an employer can do it many
 
06:20:38.468 --> 06:20:38.478 align:start position:0%
many many will but they don't have to
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
under the
 
06:20:43.150 --> 06:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
law and just a nine Financial question I
 
06:20:46.830 --> 06:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
guess how did you determine 15 was a
 
06:20:48.750 --> 06:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable cut off because I've heard
 
06:20:50.670 --> 06:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
from smaller businesses that are in the
 
06:20:53.708 --> 06:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 range and they're a little
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
upset they're someone's propos they be
 
06:21:00.350 --> 06:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
told how to manage there right uh the 15
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
was was provided by the Department of
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
Labor as a number that small businesses
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
are familiar with for a variety of other
 
06:21:10.230 --> 06:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
things so 15 is not a new number to to
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
watch out for um and previously I did
 
06:21:18.190 --> 06:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
have I did have a very nice letter uh
 
06:21:20.548 --> 06:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
from the uh anasua Chamber of Commerce I
 
06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
think it was where they were supportive
 
06:21:24.190 --> 06:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
of the concept and I think largely
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
threshold I I know Mr Burk you would
 
06:21:31.830 --> 06:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
like it to be 50 or 100 employees but
 
06:21:33.390 --> 06:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
that's not reasonable and I don't know
 
06:21:36.510 --> 06:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
if small businesses actually offer paid
 
06:21:40.030 --> 06:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
time off mine does yours I'm good for
 
06:21:43.510 --> 06:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah you're doing the right thing
 
06:21:46.190 --> 06:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and I have less than 15 employees
 
06:21:49.110 --> 06:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
but that's beside the point are they we
 
06:21:51.868 --> 06:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
ask represent cells yeah I just like to
 
06:21:53.708 --> 06:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
06:21:56.270 --> 06:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh to me
 
06:21:58.670 --> 06:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
um if uh first of all it's a good thing
 
06:22:01.070 --> 06:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't occur that often you
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
by by by your own numbers right very but
 
06:22:08.350 --> 06:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
it does occur um the thing is uh if a
 
06:22:11.230 --> 06:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
company chooses to use that policy and
 
06:22:14.270 --> 06:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
not pay vacation for somebody who's been
 
06:22:16.708 --> 06:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
terminated that I I think that's a bad
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
policy for them and
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
um but yet it's their policy so the
 
06:22:24.788 --> 06:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
employee took that job knowing that that
 
06:22:26.190 --> 06:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
was the policy
 
06:22:29.548 --> 06:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
of the company so again I think it's bad
 
06:22:31.150 --> 06:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
policy I don't think any company should
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
be doing it uh it will not help them to
 
06:22:36.070 --> 06:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
retain employees or to hire employees so
 
06:22:37.948 --> 06:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
I think that t the issue takes care of
 
06:22:40.510 --> 06:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
itself and for that reason I wouldn't
 
06:22:42.628 --> 06:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
think that this was
 
06:22:45.948 --> 06:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
necessary um thank you for your comments
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
I understand you know that you
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your situation I I want to
 
06:22:51.990 --> 06:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
add that the effective date is January 2
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
January 1 2025 so it gives people a bit
 
06:22:58.590 --> 06:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
as hands to adjust their policies and
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
again you know is it happens often
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
enough to where it CAU my attention it
 
06:23:06.910 --> 06:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
never happened to me but uh if it did
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
you my representative would have heard
 
06:23:10.230 --> 06:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
about it and they would have said well
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do and that's not
 
06:23:13.390 --> 06:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
a good enough
 
06:23:13.400 --> 06:23:15.708 align:start position:0%
a good enough
answer

06:23:15.708 --> 06:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
frankly further question represent
 
06:23:20.310 --> 06:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
grassy oh just just a comment and and in
 
06:23:23.270 --> 06:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
relation to representative gr Bell's Pro
 
06:23:25.990 --> 06:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
um I was in a situation where um we had
 
06:23:28.948 --> 06:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
a layoff because of covid we acred our
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
vacation time on January 1st people who
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
took their vacation time before covid
 
06:23:34.830 --> 06:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
got their vacations people who took
 
06:23:36.868 --> 06:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
their vacation time after Co didn't get
 
06:23:39.390 --> 06:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
paid for any vacation time it just ended
 
06:23:40.948 --> 06:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
we didn't get our vacation our vacations
 
06:23:43.590 --> 06:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
were four years you so you've been there
 
06:23:45.708 --> 06:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
and done that bill last year I well it
 
06:23:51.230 --> 06:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:56.430 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
representative

06:23:56.430 --> 06:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
representative EO I just want to clarify
 
06:24:02.190 --> 06:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
there's no state or Municipal impact
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
from this bill or um previously uh last
 
06:24:11.230 --> 06:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
last year Charlie commissioner Arling
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
house appeared before Labor I I've
 
06:24:15.708 --> 06:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
invited him to come down here and talk
 
06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
to finance but he appeared in labor and
 
06:24:21.150 --> 06:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
he said that the cost to the state would
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
be di
 
06:24:25.948 --> 06:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
Minimus uh then it doesn't happen and if
 
06:24:28.468 --> 06:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
it did it wouldn't be big and I have
 
06:24:31.788 --> 06:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
some uh I have some U supporters from
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association and I believe
 
06:24:37.070 --> 06:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a again because of
 
06:24:39.868 --> 06:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
the the the error making the recent
 
06:24:42.110 --> 06:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh the university had some
 
06:24:44.390 --> 06:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about this but that that was
 
06:24:46.948 --> 06:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the bill and I had uh
 
06:24:49.310 --> 06:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
been in contact with Miss proventure
 
06:24:52.468 --> 06:24:52.478 align:start position:0%
previously before the amendment and she
 
06:24:53.910 --> 06:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
had indicated that they had no
 
06:24:56.310 --> 06:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
objections at that time I just have to
 
06:24:58.590 --> 06:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
fix this or ask our friends in the
 
06:25:00.350 --> 06:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
Senate to fix
 
06:25:00.360 --> 06:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
Senate to fix
it

06:25:01.910 --> 06:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:25:04.310 --> 06:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
Melissa um in your packet there is an
 
06:25:06.910 --> 06:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
amended fiscal impact so the 2 million
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
is not um with the bill as
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
amended the statute that is amended in
 
06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is not applicable to the state so
 
06:25:16.830 --> 06:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact legislative branch
 
06:25:19.390 --> 06:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
executive branch or judicial branch the
 
06:25:21.070 --> 06:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
municipal Association said there's no
 
06:25:25.350 --> 06:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
impact to them the um university system
 
06:25:27.070 --> 06:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
did say there was an impact to them but
 
06:25:29.788 --> 06:25:29.798 align:start position:0%
I believe it will be reduced if the
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor Amendment go through because
 
06:25:34.708 --> 06:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
basically the um impact was due to
 
06:25:37.150 --> 06:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
employees who were let go for misconduct
 
06:25:39.110 --> 06:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
so if the amendment goes through that
 
06:25:41.788 --> 06:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
number would be
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
reduced and representative K you said
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
you'd bring that Amendment forward in
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate I think that's the best place
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:54.390 --> 06:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes or we as my clerk reminded we can do
 
06:25:55.830 --> 06:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
it here but
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would be in favor of that I
 
06:26:00.868 --> 06:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of passing on
 
06:26:04.150 --> 06:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
mistakes to we never we never have so
 
06:26:07.310 --> 06:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
why start why start
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
now all right so uh you can work with
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and grassy to
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
bring forward an amendment to straighten
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
this out please I'll be happy to all
 
06:26:20.548 --> 06:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
right you'll
 
06:26:23.670 --> 06:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
see some notice in the future of our
 
06:26:25.788 --> 06:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
final work session on your bill thank
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay finally we have House Bill
 
06:26:44.350 --> 06:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
1307 providing a supplemental
 
06:26:46.150 --> 06:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation for members of the
 
06:26:46.160 --> 06:26:47.708 align:start position:0%
appropriation for members of the
retirement

06:26:47.708 --> 06:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
system oh oh I'm sorry I'm
 
06:26:59.230 --> 06:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:02.430 --> 06:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
than record my name is Dave I'm senior
 
06:27:04.350 --> 06:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
vice president public policy with the
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
business industry
 
06:27:08.670 --> 06:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
Association almost never before this
 
06:27:19.788 --> 06:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:23.310 --> 06:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
are in all past iterations of this bill
 
06:27:25.708 --> 06:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
we have been opposed
 
06:27:30.350 --> 06:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
for the reason you stated C that these
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:38.868 --> 06:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
design should be the employer that makes
 
06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
decision not State over the summer and
 
06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh fall uh represent kill and I worked
 
06:27:49.468 --> 06:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
with each other and I said perhaps you
 
06:27:53.430 --> 06:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
might want to consider a very narrow
 
06:27:55.750 --> 06:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
proposal which would
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um benefit those employees who received
 
06:28:02.750 --> 06:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
AC crov vacation time but never had the
 
06:28:05.150 --> 06:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use it and it was
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
completely out of their hands so we
 
06:28:11.548 --> 06:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
settled up a layoff with no reasonable
 
06:28:12.628 --> 06:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
chance of
 
06:28:16.510 --> 06:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
beinged a business closure or a business
 
06:28:20.110 --> 06:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
sale if the new owner of the business
 
06:28:23.468 --> 06:28:23.478 align:start position:0%
was not recognizing that and that's
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
that's it um even that the Bia did not
 
06:28:30.948 --> 06:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
support the bill however we did not
 
06:28:33.468 --> 06:28:33.478 align:start position:0%
oppose and I tried to
 
06:28:36.788 --> 06:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
explain how I thought this would be fair
 
06:28:41.948 --> 06:28:41.958 align:start position:0%
for employ no never have the opportunity
 
06:28:43.868 --> 06:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
take and it
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
would impact certain businesses
 
06:28:50.190 --> 06:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
certainly but when you look at the
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
incidence of of layoffs business
 
06:28:56.468 --> 06:28:56.478 align:start position:0%
closures it's a
 
06:28:59.750 --> 06:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
address microphone oh sorry I thought I
 
06:29:04.390 --> 06:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
had sorry do I need to start from the
 
06:29:06.190 --> 06:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
beginning no
 
06:29:11.310 --> 06:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
you're um the 15 uh employees is is a is
 
06:29:13.948 --> 06:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
a somewhat arbitrary number and the
 
06:29:18.390 --> 06:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
state could choose 15 25 50 is the
 
06:29:20.948 --> 06:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
number that's often used for for federal
 
06:29:20.958 --> 06:29:22.310 align:start position:0%
number that's often used for for federal
employment

06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
employment
 
06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
regulations the the 15 is not uncommon
 
06:29:27.628 --> 06:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
in the state though for uh
 
06:29:29.708 --> 06:29:29.718 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination uh statutes that
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
businesses have to comply the number is
 
06:29:34.868 --> 06:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
generally 15 employees or more so I
 
06:29:36.910 --> 06:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
think that's what the number that was
 
06:29:40.270 --> 06:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
settled upon but it's it's it it is
 
06:29:44.310 --> 06:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary um I did want to
 
06:29:46.788 --> 06:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
point out because uh representative
 
06:29:49.070 --> 06:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
kahill and I did have a
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
conversation about what passed on the
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
house floor and he was right the um
 
06:29:57.990 --> 06:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
the wording starting on line 17 and
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
continuing through line 19 does not
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
reflect what our conversation and
 
06:30:06.670 --> 06:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
general agreement was there's another
 
06:30:09.868 --> 06:30:09.878 align:start position:0%
area that that I'll be bringing up in
 
06:30:12.030 --> 06:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate I don't expect this committee
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
to take it up because I understand
 
06:30:15.628 --> 06:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
you're not a policy committee but on
 
06:30:19.150 --> 06:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
line um starting on line 26 it says in L
 
06:30:22.070 --> 06:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
of payment for unused paid time off an
 
06:30:24.270 --> 06:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
employee uh may agree in writing that
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're unused used paid time off can be
 
06:30:27.990 --> 06:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
carried forward and transferred to the
 
06:30:30.350 --> 06:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent employer our belief is that
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the employees decision that
 
06:30:36.190 --> 06:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
should be the employer the the seller of
 
06:30:38.670 --> 06:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
the business and the new buyer and in
 
06:30:40.110 --> 06:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
cases where the new buyer doesn't
 
06:30:42.230 --> 06:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the time then that should be
 
06:30:45.030 --> 06:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
paid to the employee but the employee in
 
06:30:49.310 --> 06:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
our our uh belief is should not have the
 
06:30:52.030 --> 06:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
um latitude to say they want their pay
 
06:30:53.830 --> 06:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
now regardless of what the new employer
 
06:30:56.388 --> 06:30:56.398 align:start position:0%
says but uh I'll again I'll be dealing
 
06:30:57.830 --> 06:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
with that on the Senate side if this
 
06:31:00.350 --> 06:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
Bill gets over thank you Mr chair happy
 
06:31:03.548 --> 06:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions represent grassy
 
06:31:05.270 --> 06:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah just a question on that on on line
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
20 uh 26 or you said there it says in
 
06:31:09.708 --> 06:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
Lee of payment for unused time an
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
employee described may agree it doesn't
 
06:31:13.948 --> 06:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
say that they're the one that asking for
 
06:31:15.510 --> 06:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
but that they may agree to have it so if
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
their employers asked them if they were
 
06:31:19.708 --> 06:31:19.718 align:start position:0%
willing to do that they may agree to do
 
06:31:22.270 --> 06:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
it but they don't necessarily they're
 
06:31:24.230 --> 06:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
not requesting it it's the employer who
 
06:31:27.350 --> 06:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:29.868 --> 06:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
them I agree with you and if they don't
 
06:31:31.388 --> 06:31:31.398 align:start position:0%
want it they can get their money right
 
06:31:32.990 --> 06:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
then and there that that makes it less
 
06:31:34.670 --> 06:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
egregious yeah that I guess that would
 
06:31:37.070 --> 06:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
essentially be saying the the employer
 
06:31:39.788 --> 06:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
says you know we're divesting oursel of
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
this business and and we'll just pay for
 
06:31:44.750 --> 06:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
any acred time and not leave it up to it
 
06:31:46.430 --> 06:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a part of the but he said
 
06:31:48.948 --> 06:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
as part of the sale I'm transferring it
 
06:31:51.788 --> 06:31:51.798 align:start position:0%
over with your benefits right in intact
 
06:31:53.468 --> 06:31:53.478 align:start position:0%
and he said sure I'll take that it's a
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:00.750 --> 06:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
so representative grassy and Maguire
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
you'll make sure that works right good
 
06:32:06.510 --> 06:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
all right we sometimes do do a little
 
06:32:07.948 --> 06:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
policy here if we think we're making
 
06:32:09.788 --> 06:32:09.798 align:start position:0%
things better but often we mess it up
 
06:32:12.830 --> 06:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll try we'll try to make it
 
06:32:15.230 --> 06:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly yeah I think we'll be okay
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
I I can't imagine uh any messing up that
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly occur not on this not out
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
of here no
 
06:32:23.638 --> 06:32:27.510 align:start position:0%
of here no
any

06:32:27.510 --> 06:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:30.510 --> 06:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
or he'll bring an amendment to fix it so
 
06:32:31.990 --> 06:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much so
 
06:32:35.830 --> 06:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
now we'll move to House Bill

$50,000 over the last decade the cost of

living based B on a CPI has gone up
 
06:34:00.270 --> 06:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 29. 33% while col is
 
06:34:01.910 --> 06:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
granted to group two police and
 
06:34:04.310 --> 06:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters over the same time period
 
06:34:04.320 --> 06:34:05.708 align:start position:0%
firefighters over the same time period
were

06:34:05.708 --> 06:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:34:08.510 --> 06:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
1.5% over the last 20 years the cost of
 
06:34:12.430 --> 06:34:12.440 align:start position:0%

06:34:14.388 --> 06:34:14.398 align:start position:0%
while col is granted to group two police
 
06:34:17.868 --> 06:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
and fire over the same time period were
 
06:34:21.990 --> 06:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
12.25% and 15% respectively that is over
 
06:34:24.670 --> 06:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
52% of a pensioner's buying power that
 
06:34:27.030 --> 06:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
has been eliminated due to inflation and
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
the lack of adequate cers in 2022 the
 
06:34:34.868 --> 06:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
$500 stien granted uh went predominantly
 
06:34:38.910 --> 06:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
to group one out of the $ 11.6 million
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note group one received $10.75
 
06:34:46.430 --> 06:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
million over 92% of the 11.6 million
 
06:34:51.150 --> 06:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
went to group one over the 23, 267
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
eligible recipients there were only 498
 
06:34:57.468 --> 06:34:57.478 align:start position:0%
Group Two Fire receiving the stien last
 
06:34:59.310 --> 06:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
year the Senate changed a bill that
 
06:35:02.750 --> 06:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
allowed for group two uh Cola benefits
 
06:35:05.110 --> 06:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
to include group one and change the
 
06:35:08.230 --> 06:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility of the stien to a members
 
06:35:09.868 --> 06:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
earning less than
 
06:35:12.868 --> 06:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
$30,000 again those changes eliminated a
 
06:35:15.190 --> 06:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
large number of group two members the
 
06:35:16.750 --> 06:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
average pension for a group two
 
06:35:18.948 --> 06:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
firefighter is approximately
 
06:35:21.350 --> 06:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
$45,000 remember group two does not
 
06:35:23.948 --> 06:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
receive Social Security social security
 
06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
has given its members an 88.7% increase
 
06:35:31.510 --> 06:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
in 2023 and 3.2% this year unfortunately
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
group two police and fire did not
 
06:35:36.030 --> 06:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
receive so don't receive Social Security
 
06:35:38.830 --> 06:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
under the windfall act in 1984 if a
 
06:35:40.750 --> 06:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
group two member were to be eligible for
 
06:35:42.750 --> 06:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
Social Security their benefits would be
 
06:35:45.868 --> 06:35:45.878 align:start position:0%
reduced by 40% at minimum and as much as
 
06:35:48.590 --> 06:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
90% depending on their pension
 
06:35:49.990 --> 06:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
predominantly the New Hampshire
 
06:35:51.628 --> 06:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
retirement system is the group two
 
06:35:53.948 --> 06:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
members uh is what group two members
 
06:35:56.788 --> 06:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
rely on for their retirement income very
 
06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
simple math shows that the members that
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
a matter of time without Coler
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment pensioners will be forced on
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
some kind of Social Services because
 
06:36:06.830 --> 06:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
their pensions will be devoured by
 
06:36:09.830 --> 06:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
inflation Most states provide a retire
 
06:36:11.590 --> 06:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
their retirees with a cost delivering
 
06:36:13.548 --> 06:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
adjustment the state of Maine for
 
06:36:15.910 --> 06:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
example who came to testify at the
 
06:36:18.468 --> 06:36:18.478 align:start position:0%
request of the denial committee offers a
 
06:36:21.990 --> 06:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
3% Coler to their retirees manchest uh
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts offers an ad hoc Cola
 
06:36:28.230 --> 06:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
based on a CPI of up to 500 5% applied
 
06:36:29.590 --> 06:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the first
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
$133,000 Vermont offers an automatic
 
06:36:35.868 --> 06:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
Cola based on a CPI up to 5% compounded
 
06:36:38.190 --> 06:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
granted a reasonable Cola granting a
 
06:36:40.110 --> 06:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable Cola for group two retirees
 
06:36:42.670 --> 06:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
will greatly reduce the impact inflation
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
has had on them over the last two
 
06:36:47.910 --> 06:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
decades the stien offer in House Bill
 
06:36:50.750 --> 06:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
1307 is nowhere near what the retiree
 
06:36:52.990 --> 06:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
should have received but is a step in
 
06:36:55.230 --> 06:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
the right direction I you please support
 
06:36:57.628 --> 06:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
your disabled workers and vote in favor
 
06:36:59.150 --> 06:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
06:37:03.150 --> 06:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
1307 um I have uh I got a text from uh
 
06:37:05.150 --> 06:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative Damon she would have been
 
06:37:09.388 --> 06:37:09.398 align:start position:0%
here but she was down in um uh education
 
06:37:11.110 --> 06:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then she had a meeting and she
 
06:37:13.150 --> 06:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
thought that uh representative Maguire
 
06:37:15.430 --> 06:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
was going to come in uh to present it uh
 
06:37:17.708 --> 06:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
for Edna but obviously that didn't
 
06:37:17.718 --> 06:37:19.388 align:start position:0%
for Edna but obviously that didn't
happen

06:37:19.388 --> 06:37:19.398 align:start position:0%
happen

an error an oversight that happened
 
06:38:44.788 --> 06:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
essentially two years ago when we gave a
 
06:38:50.548 --> 06:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
$500 um supplemental uh allowance to um
 
06:38:53.310 --> 06:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
retirees who had been retired 20 years
 
06:38:54.548 --> 06:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
or more
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that and that it was sort of an
 
06:38:58.910 --> 06:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
oversight because disabled
 
06:39:01.830 --> 06:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
retirees often don't make it to 20 years
 
06:39:04.590 --> 06:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
but they wanted to give the this $500 to
 
06:39:07.628 --> 06:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
that group but the way I'm reading this
 
06:39:11.948 --> 06:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
is is it possible that there is disabled
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
employees who receive that 500 but would
 
06:39:19.070 --> 06:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
also receive this 500 yeah under the
 
06:39:22.270 --> 06:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
bill as written that that is true um I
 
06:39:24.670 --> 06:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
think the original uh impetus for the
 
06:39:27.388 --> 06:39:27.398 align:start position:0%
bill last year um there was a $500
 
06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
payment that was ultimately included in
 
06:39:31.388 --> 06:39:31.398 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 I forget the the original
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill number for it and it had a require
 
06:39:36.350 --> 06:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
had three requirements I had to be
 
06:39:39.750 --> 06:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
retired by 71 of 18 uh had to have a
 
06:39:42.990 --> 06:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
pension of under 40,000 and had to have
 
06:39:46.788 --> 06:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
had at least 20 years of service that is
 
06:39:50.708 --> 06:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
language that was uh used in a couple of
 
06:39:53.150 --> 06:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
other colas there was in a years of
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
service requ is onetime payments uh in
 
06:39:58.670 --> 06:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
past year not all of the $500 payments
 
06:39:59.788 --> 06:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
have had that
 
06:40:02.110 --> 06:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
requirement um so there was a
 
06:40:04.670 --> 06:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
constituent a representative Damon in my
 
06:40:05.830 --> 06:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
understanding from speaking with her
 
06:40:08.388 --> 06:40:08.398 align:start position:0%
that had was disabled on the job you
 
06:40:10.430 --> 06:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
know with 19 or so years of service and
 
06:40:12.868 --> 06:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
didn't receive that uh the bill as
 
06:40:17.110 --> 06:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
written came in would Grant $500 to all
 
06:40:19.868 --> 06:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
accidental uh disability retirement uh
 
06:40:22.388 --> 06:40:22.398 align:start position:0%
retirees or Ben beneficiaries receiving
 
06:40:25.708 --> 06:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
that benefit uh who were retired prior
 
06:40:30.030 --> 06:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
to 71 of 18 the benefit is under 50 um
 
06:40:32.468 --> 06:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
and there's no years required for that
 
06:40:35.468 --> 06:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
so it it is it is a SL so there could be
 
06:40:37.788 --> 06:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
if you do an overlay there certainly are
 
06:40:39.548 --> 06:40:39.558 align:start position:0%
probably some people who became dis
 
06:40:42.150 --> 06:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
disabled later in their careers after 20
 
06:40:44.388 --> 06:40:44.398 align:start position:0%
years I don't I don't have a number for
 
06:40:47.350 --> 06:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
that um but the total population for
 
06:40:50.510 --> 06:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
this as written is about $ 800 so
 
06:40:53.150 --> 06:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
$400,000 um the the fiscal note is still
 
06:40:53.160 --> 06:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
$400,000 um the the fiscal note is still
accurate

06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:40:58.230 --> 06:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's it
 
06:41:02.430 --> 06:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank so Marty 802 people are disabled
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
out there
 
06:41:07.388 --> 06:41:07.398 align:start position:0%
receiving yeah and um this is uh
 
06:41:09.230 --> 06:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
accidental disability so that's the
 
06:41:12.548 --> 06:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
statutory term that means job related
 
06:41:14.548 --> 06:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
there are other there probably a few
 
06:41:17.150 --> 06:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
other hundred or couple thousand people
 
06:41:18.948 --> 06:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
who are retired under what's called
 
06:41:20.868 --> 06:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
Ordinary disability that's non-job
 
06:41:22.868 --> 06:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
related you know they got a disease or
 
06:41:23.948 --> 06:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
you know fell off their roof or
 
06:41:26.388 --> 06:41:26.398 align:start position:0%
something not related to work um and are
 
06:41:27.750 --> 06:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
getting a benefit it's a different
 
06:41:30.030 --> 06:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
structure the this bill only covers The
 
06:41:32.910 --> 06:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
Accidental the folks injured on the
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
job represent McGuire does that include
 
06:41:42.430 --> 06:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
PTSD types um that is um part of that
 
06:41:44.510 --> 06:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
can be a diagnos the law was changed a
 
06:41:47.388 --> 06:41:47.398 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and we've had a a small
 
06:41:49.948 --> 06:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
number that that was the only Factor
 
06:41:51.948 --> 06:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
usually there are a number of factors
 
06:41:54.548 --> 06:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
that they're qualified under for
 
06:41:58.230 --> 06:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
disability U we did did a presentation
 
06:42:00.388 --> 06:42:00.398 align:start position:0%
for the there's a statutory committee on
 
06:42:02.750 --> 06:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
PTSD last summer I don't have the
 
06:42:05.750 --> 06:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
details of that at my fingertips but um
 
06:42:08.190 --> 06:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a fairly limited number
 
06:42:10.230 --> 06:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen an uptick in those cases
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
over the last five years since the law
 
06:42:14.548 --> 06:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
changed or
 
06:42:17.548 --> 06:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
06:42:21.670 --> 06:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions the division have a pleasure
 
06:42:23.388 --> 06:42:23.398 align:start position:0%
of what they would like to do with the
 
06:42:23.398 --> 06:42:24.750 align:start position:0%
of what they would like to do with the
bill

06:42:24.750 --> 06:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:42:27.150 --> 06:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
car told me to move out the path you
 
06:42:30.150 --> 06:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
better do you better do what she says
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:38.948 --> 06:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
thought anyway have to have a little
 
06:42:40.468 --> 06:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
humor right it's seconded by
 
06:42:43.310 --> 06:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative grassy is there any are
 
06:42:45.150 --> 06:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
there any further questions this is
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
house built
 
06:42:52.670 --> 06:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:52.680 --> 06:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
ready

06:42:56.990 --> 06:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:59.910 --> 06:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
