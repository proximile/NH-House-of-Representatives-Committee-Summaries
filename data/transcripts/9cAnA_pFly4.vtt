00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of hearings today
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to start off with the
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
if you're going to introduce the bill
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
senator guida
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the

committee for the record bob guy to
 
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
committee for the record bob guy to

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
senate district 2 and prime sponsor
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 239
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
grew out of
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
the seemingly never-ending saga of
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville and haverhill which are in my
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
district and it's been going on for
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
this bill's genesis was the fact that
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
the precinct of woodsville
 
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.110 align:start position:0%
the precinct of woodsville
despite

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
despite
 
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
despite
ordinance

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
requiring an audit annually
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
had literally never done a financial
 
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.790 align:start position:0%
had literally never done a financial
audit

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
despite 10 years of written telephonic
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
and electronic communications from dri
 
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
and electronic communications from dri
dra

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
requesting an audit
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
the problem is the dra had no teeth
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right and so
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh what this bill does
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
because i'm certain that there are other
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions out there that
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is to establish a
 
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is to establish a
requirement

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then to
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
put in a process for remediation of a
 
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.749 align:start position:0%
put in a process for remediation of a
delinquent

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
delinquent
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
i worked closely with dra to establish
 
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
i worked closely with dra to establish
this

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
and just to take you through the
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
provisos we worked very hard to give the
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivision every opportunity
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
god bless you every opportunity to
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
remedy the problem there are oversights
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
some very small precincts or very small
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
towns or whatever might have overlooked
 
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
towns or whatever might have overlooked
so

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
so
dra

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be required to give notice
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
to the community or to the political
 
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.749 align:start position:0%
to the community or to the political
subdivision

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
subdivision
right

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the absence of an audit
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
the community would have a period of
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
time to respond
 
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.710 align:start position:0%
time to respond
and

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
there would be a penalty assessed 250 up
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
to 250 a day
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
now for some towns that's a lot for some
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
some cities that may not be so much but
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's certainly going to raise eyebrows
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
and ask questions the purpose of this is
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
to require municipal officials to comply
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
with the audit requirement it's been in
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
law for years back in
 
00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
law for years back in
2011-12

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
2011-12
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
they stripped all the auditors out of a
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
dra so they don't have the ability to go
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
audit themselves we still haven't
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
restored those positions
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
but this puts into law the fact that if
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're a political subdivision you have
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to tax you have the ability
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
to spend
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
you certainly have the obligation to
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
report on a regular basis per the laws
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
that every other political subdivision
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the state is following and so that's
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose behind the bill i'm happy to
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
answer any details uh questions from the
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee any questions
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so upon um
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
examining the statutes
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
um in this section that the bill
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
pertains to one of the things that i
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
noted is that in section one roman
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
numeral no
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
number one of the bill
 
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.150 align:start position:0%
number one of the bill
um

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
lines five and six the the term
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is referenced
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
however um in section two of the bill
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
it specifies
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
citytown school district or village
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
district or precinct
 
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.189 align:start position:0%
district or precinct
so

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
i guess my
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is is do we need to define
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
political subdivision because i didn't
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
see a definition
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i know that in some some bills like
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
for example there's senate bill 259 of
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
this year where political subdivision
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
was specifically defined
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
as it pertained to that bill
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
so um could you just clarify that for me
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's no oversights
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
i would have no objection to an
 
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.469 align:start position:0%
i would have no objection to an
amendment

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
into specifying the specific little
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions up on uh
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
subdivisions up on uh
um

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
in section roman four i think it was as
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
as defined down below
 
00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
as defined down below
um

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
so again i think that's a technicality
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
there's certainly no intent to make any
 
00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:13.110 align:start position:0%
there's certainly no intent to make any
differentiation

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
differentiation
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps i know if dra has someone here
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
apparently not but i would have no
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
objection to refining that definition
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
and resolving the disparity that you
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative maturi
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it might be
 
00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it might be
piggybacking

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
piggybacking
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
um it might be piggybacking on the same
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
question does political subdivisions
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
include library trustees
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think it does because i don't
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
know that i'm not certain but i don't
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
think it does okay
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator i have a
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh some part of a hang up when you when
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
they delivering the fine you say fine it
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
says fine
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
of up to 250 per day that could be
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
anything up to 250
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it's written like it's discretionary
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
it could be fifty dollars a day to one
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
place and a hundred dollars was there
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
any reason why you weren't more specific
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
and said
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
it was two hundred and fifty dollars a
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
day instead of up to
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
that was i think the request of the of
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the dra it gives
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
them latitude
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know a minor infraction uh or an
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
oversight as opposed to a willful
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
disregard of the law just to give them
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
some latitude to apply their judgment
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
because ultimately the ones who they are
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ones who will make that adjudication
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
i understand that i'm just uh stating
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
and i'm kind of conferring concern what
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
it says up to because
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know could be all over the place and
 
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
you know could be all over the place and
uh

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
and nobody there's no oversight there so
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
raised the question why it wasn't more
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
specific thank you senator thank you
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.389 align:start position:0%
yes sir
representative

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh when you introduced this bill you
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that i believe woodsville was
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
violating an ordinance by not performing
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
an audit is that
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
state statute it's state statute so
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
in practice this bill would just provide
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
a fine some kind of a consequence
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's no consequence now for violating
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
statute no consequence in the way of
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement if there was one this gives
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
for the senator
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative service
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
in all of the years of non-compliance
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
by the town of woodsville
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh with with this statute has there been
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
any communication from woodsville to dra
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
as to why the audits are not being
 
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
as to why the audits are not being
performed

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that i introduced last year
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
it required forced by law
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay a statute that we passed
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
to not a statute a bill that we passed
 
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
to not a statute a bill that we passed
to

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh have a an audit done and the results
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
of those are that audit
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
independent audit by you know one of the
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of the municipal auditing firms be
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
returned over to dra we had to pass
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
a law
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
to require the precinct of woodsville
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
to do what was otherwise prescribed in
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
law because there was no other way to
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.030 align:start position:0%
yes
up

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um senator but i don't think
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
the question was answered
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
has there been any communication from
 
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
has there been any communication from
woodsville

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
to the dra or to you or any other
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
concerned parties as to why the audits
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes voluminous communications once we
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
put the law through
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
and then woodsville opened up there was
 
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
and then woodsville opened up there was
look

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
the results of the audit were not very
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
complimentary let's start with that just
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
leave it at that and and so there are
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
those that might assert there were
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
intentions there
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is still ongoing both litigation
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
between woodsville and haverhill and to
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question yes
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
but the communications was only once we
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
passed the law and put teeth into it
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
that required them to to do this
 
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.310 align:start position:0%
that required them to to do this
audit

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
which has turned up irregularities so
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
um woodsville basically ignored the dra
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
and i really wish someone from d.r.a was
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
here to testify to this but you can call
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner any time commissioner
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
stepp and and she'll be certain to
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
verify or james gary who handles the
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
municipal over there
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
his words not mine it was the worst
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
example of municipal accounting he's
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
seen in 30 years
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
there were years worth of checks and
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
back rooms and all kinds of stuff so
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
again the reason for an audit is to
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that this political subdivision
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay is not playing fast and loose with
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer authority the tax authority
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
that they have and the funds that they
 
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.710 align:start position:0%
that they have and the funds that they
raise

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
so there was really not much no no
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
communications up until the point that
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
the law we passed last year two years
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
ago now
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
was put in place to force the audit and
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
then at that point of course they saw
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
where this was going
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator i have a question
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
would you mind if i sat down before sure
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't want to walk in front
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
of you or the
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
person testifying without permission
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.199 --> 00:13:58.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
obviously there are other towns and
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and political
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
are in violation of this
 
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
are in violation of this
um

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
of one instance
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
of a school
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
where sometimes six months eight months
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
you would never see
 
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.069 align:start position:0%
you would never see
uh

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
any any audit posted
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
have you seen or heard of any other
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
situations for a long length of time
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
other than the two that you mentioned
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
again remember we're talking about fire
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
precincts water districts anyone has the
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
ability to tax
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
right or to raise revenue
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
under the guise of a public service or
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
as a public entity should be required to
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
be accountable for the the receipt and
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
dispensing of those funds appropriately
 
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.069 align:start position:0%
dispensing of those funds appropriately
um

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
and if they're not there's really no
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
remedy for a citizen other than to try
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
to take a town to court
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
right we do have standing now based on
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
the law we passed what four or five
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
but you know communities and precincts
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
you take an oath to support and defend
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
the constitution the laws of the state
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so help you god
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
and there are precincts and water
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
districts and other political
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or whatever category you
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
might want to say they're out there and
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
i don't say that they're doing anything
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
criminal i'm not saying that they're
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
willingly they may not be aware
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay but this also provides
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
gives a proviso
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
that dra will notify right
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
all governing bodies of all
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities political subdivisions
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
and counties subject to this statute
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
within 60 days the effective date
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
so it also makes absolutely sure that
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
every one of these entities that's out
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
there knows hey you need to do this
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
audit and there's a penalty coming
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
albeit we're pretty lenient and allowing
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
you latitude
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean you can either do the audit or
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
within 90 days present a contract that
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've had it contracted to be done by a
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
you know an auto municipal auditing firm
 
00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.910 align:start position:0%
you know an auto municipal auditing firm
so

00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.509 align:start position:0%
so
unfortunately

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
uh you know you have to do the stick and
 
00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:04.710 align:start position:0%
uh you know you have to do the stick and
carrot

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
carrot
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
we do need a stick and this would
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
provide the stick for those communities
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
or political subdivisions entities that
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
are recalcitrant in complying with the
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
audit requirements of the law thank you
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
senator isn't it
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
with reference to a question we had
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
earlier isn't it true that libraries
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
which would be would come under the
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
category of the municipal government and
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
therefore the audit would include them
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
i would think it would include the
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
library as a component of municipal
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
government whether or not it actually
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
audits the library itself that i'm not
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
audits the library itself that i'm not
certain

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh to follow up on the earlier questions
 
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
uh to follow up on the earlier questions
concerning

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
defining the political subdivision i
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that trust funds are
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
included in that
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
because trust funds
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
are seem separate from
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
at least in our community
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
from the town itself
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
so are you may i ask a question mr chair
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes are you asking
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
if the community has a trust fund
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
if the community has a trust fund
or

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know private sector trust fund no
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is the town trust fund that would
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
i'm sure be be carried categorized as an
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
asset to the town yes and therefore if
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's listed on the
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the ms form
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
then i'm quite certain that it would be
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
subject to review and if any
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
irregularities were found
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
if you're not comfortable i'm very
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with you adding a proviso
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
that would say maybe specifically
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
stipulate municipal trust funds to be
 
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
stipulate municipal trust funds to be
audited

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
audited
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe separately but i don't see them as
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
a separate component as long as they're
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
incorporated within the town's
 
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
incorporated within the town's
governance

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
governance
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
taking my um
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
in section
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
2 line 20
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
it as well as
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
line 30.
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill lists
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
municipality political subdivision or
 
00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:17.430 align:start position:0%
municipality political subdivision or
county

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of that is that this
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
bill would pertain to
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the county level as well
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
as far as audits are concerned
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
is that a correct interpretation that is
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you again he's got taxing
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
authority dispense lots of funds to make
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
sure they're in compliance you know with
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
gaap and the other the other accounting
 
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
gaap and the other the other accounting
principles

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
principles
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative davis did you have an
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
additional question
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure this is in the bill somewhere
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm just not seeing it but is this
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
an annual requirement i think it is an
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
annual audit requirement say that in the
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill correct
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
it says that in the bill it does not but
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's already an existing statute yeah
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none i think
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i appreciate your your
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
attendance and your uh testimony thank
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
you chairman dolan members of the
 
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.390 align:start position:0%
you chairman dolan members of the
committee

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
so we're going to stand in recess until
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to this this bill
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
when i asked if there's any additional
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
speakers or whatever just
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
get my attention like this
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative dolan and members of the
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee it's nice to be back i haven't
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
seen you in a while so nhma is here to
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill in part
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
we are not in opposition to performing
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
an audit and following the statutory
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
compliance recommendations and
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and rsa
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
21 j 19 and 20.
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's also best practice of course to
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
perform the municipal audit and do it in
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
a timely manner to make sure there's no
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
weakness and deficiency however we
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
oppose any penalties being levied
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
against municipalities as in many cases
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that could be a heavy lift for some of
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
our communities especially the smaller
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
ones we do understand that
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
the dra would give proper notice a
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
90-day notice to levy such a fine
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
however we do think that
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
in most cases our municipalities are
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
willing to be compliant and follow the
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
rules as long as they
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
have ample warning and understanding
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
of what the new law would entail
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
so we do want to explain that the annual
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
financial audit should be part and is
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
required to be part of the annual
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
financial reporting process and is
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
required to be placed in a town's annual
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
report the audit would contain other
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
accounts such as libraries trustees of
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
trust funds and other government
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
activities in order to assess the true
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
and accurate financial position of a
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
community so that should be required in
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
an audit and that would be performed
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
especially by the outside auditing firms
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
they would of course be providing that
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
information to a town so libraries and
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
trustees would be part of that process
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
so i did want to clarify that as that
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
was asked
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
so the other reason why
 
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
so the other reason why
towns

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
should be performing their audit and
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to be performing an audit is
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
because bonding requires an audit and
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
audited financials going back a number
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
of years as do tan and band notes and in
 
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.149 align:start position:0%
of years as do tan and band notes and in
the

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
situation where a town might require a
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
tax anticipation note or a bond
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
anticipation no the bond bank would be
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
requiring those statements so it's
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
always in the town's best interest to be
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
performing their annual audit and
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
uploading it to dra would just be one
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
more step that we certainly have no
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to in that process so i can
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you might have
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
any questions for nhma yes
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
what do you suggest we have to do to get
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
what do you uh suggest
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
that we do to get to town to comply with
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing the audit other than find them
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
in that particular situation it sounds
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
like the dra has been
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
in contact with that town
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to why that's happening in
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
that community i do hope that it is
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
one of the rare exceptions certainly we
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
know most of our towns if not all are
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
performing regular audits i know
 
00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
performing regular audits i know
auditors

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
auditors
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
it talks about having a year and there's
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
a reason for that is because we only
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount of auditing firms
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
and audits are scheduled as timely as
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
possible so
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
auditors you know do have to go through
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
each town and do their tests and go in
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and look at the books many times
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
physically certainly having a great
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
number of detailed reports and documents
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
provided to them but i can't speak to
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
what should be done for this particular
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
um community and i'm not familiar
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
intimately with that situation thank you
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
mr president
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
my question just a clarification so you
 
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.029 align:start position:0%
my question just a clarification so you
think

00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
statute that exists
 
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.789 align:start position:0%
statute that exists
is

00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh pretty detailed or required
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
this bill will make it more punitive
 
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
this bill will make it more punitive
for

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
if one any of the communities
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
does not comply with what's existing am
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
i correct in understanding you are
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
correct so um
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
are any other
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up mr chair yes go ahead
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
please um
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other statues or
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
have shown that going to the punitive
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
will not will either increase or
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
decrease the compliance
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
so i can speak to that anecdotally that
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have been assured
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire retirement system
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
or the dra that these fines are very
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
rarely if ever levied against
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that's really
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
reassuring to know that they don't often
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
have to take that action so in my
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
professional opinion that would mean if
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
they're very rarely the ones that exist
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
in statute now
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
levied that it probably is not
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:51.830 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
okay

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
as i
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh was headed before we're going to take
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
a recess for five minutes
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
tony thank you yes i'm going to turn my
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
stuff in after each hearing if it's okay
 
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
stuff in after each hearing if it's okay
um

00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
let's check and see if
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
it goes okay
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
make the determination towards the end
 
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:53.110 align:start position:0%
make the determination towards the end
okay

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh not yet
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
let's see the next one is 245
 
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.149 align:start position:0%
let's see the next one is 245
okay

00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:36.549 align:start position:0%
okay
245.

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
245.
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is the municipal and county
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is senator tom
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
sherman district 24
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
11 towns on the seacoast
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i am introducing sb 245 which is
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
agreements between developers and
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities on municipal trash
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
removal fees paid by condominium owners
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
and renters
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
this was brought to my attention uh with
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
a request to
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
fix the problem um
 
00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
fix the problem um
in

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
a practice that was occurring in one of
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
my towns
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
i've come to understand that it happens
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
intermittently across the state
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
and what this bill would do would be to
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
establish a committee to study
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
agreements between developers of
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
condominium units and municipalities
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
regarding municipal trash removal fees
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
in many circumstances unit owners
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay for private trash pickup
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
while at the same time that service is
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
included in their property taxes
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
so they're basically paying for a
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
service that they're not getting
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
and the goal of the study committee
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be to examine the agreements and
 
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.310 align:start position:0%
would be to examine the agreements and
determine

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
why fees are paid for services not
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
rendered and whether that's appropriate
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
i thought about putting in a bill that
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
just didn't allow this to happen but as
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
we all have learned over time
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
things that seem pretty simple
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
are actually very complicated and
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we came up with the study
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee to answer my constituents
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
concern i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
so

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
this seems relevant to one of my own
 
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
this seems relevant to one of my own
bills

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
i had a bill
 
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
i had a bill
to

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
require public housing
 
00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:18.789 align:start position:0%
require public housing
to

00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:22.789 align:start position:0%
to
provide

00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
provide for
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
compost and recycling services to
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
tenants who live in their public housing
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
and that got referred to interim study
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
for one of the
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
reasons where well how's it going to be
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
funded and
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
what what are the municipalities
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
with this once they pick it up so
 
00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:49.909 align:start position:0%
with this once they pick it up so
would

00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
this study committee help
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
to answer questions like that at all
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.029 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee the duties in line 11 through
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
13 either the committee shall examine
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
issues regarding agreements with
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
developers and municipalities i would
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
assume those developers could be
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
developers of any kind of housing
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
the result of which that
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and renters are
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
paying municipal fees to cover trash
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
removal services without receiving the
 
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
removal services without receiving the
benefit

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
same kind of agreement that we see
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
and this bill would not cover that with
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
things like private roads you know where
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
the inducements are that the
 
00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.269 align:start position:0%
the inducements are that the
uh

00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
uh
are

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
a benefit to the developer but not a
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
benefit to the people who actually end
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
up living there for
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
the lifetime of that development
 
00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
the lifetime of that development
so

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
i it might be a stretch for the
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
branch out to that but i i don't think
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
it would be something that they
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't take up
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
yes for a follow-up well so yeah
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up um would you support an
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
 
00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:11.909 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
to

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
um clear that up and make it a little
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a stretch say replacing the word
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
trash with waste so that way it's
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
broader and covers compost and recycling
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
as well absolutely sure okay thanks
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so my question
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
has to do with um wording
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill lines two and three
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
it it specifies condo owners and renters
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that the intention is
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
renters of the condos not just renters
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
in general like renters of apartments
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
right and i'd be open if you wanted to
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
make that more specific i'd be open to
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
wording change there but
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
the condos may be owned by
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
person x but person y is renting from
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
the condo owner
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this would or or the
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the committee would be looking at
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically the people living
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the complex
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to come
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.069 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
you had
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
talked with people about this
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
it uh it seems that you might have
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
been given uh
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
examples of
how

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
the municipalities are requiring
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
additional fees to to remove trash
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
could could you share one of those
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
examples with us yes i believe the
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
constituent who brought this is here to
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
testify but
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
in one of my towns hampton actually
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
provides as
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not in my district but exeter
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
also provides municipal trash pickup
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
owners of
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
certain condos in hampton
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
are currently paying municipal trash
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
haulage fees in as part of their
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative tripp oh you are you done
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
with uh no follow-up uh
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh gilman
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh since you
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
cited exeter and i represent exeter i'm
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
ask this question i'm not sure if i'll
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
be clear but
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
our program is a pay-as-you-throw
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
program so
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and renters can
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
pay as you throw get a bag they have to
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
buy a bag just like everybody else
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
put on the curbside just like everybody
 
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.829 align:start position:0%
put on the curbside just like everybody
else

00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
and they're not paying extra they're
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
paying what everyone else is paying to
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
remove the trash
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and just to clarify i know
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
exeter has municipal trash which is
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
was my point but i don't know of any
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
situations in exeter
 
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
situations in exeter
that

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
would be similar to what's happened in
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampton so at the time the condo
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
development was put in place in hampton
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
there is an agreement between the
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
developer and the town
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
developer and the town
that

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
the condo association has to provide its
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
own trash pickup but they're still being
 
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
own trash pickup but they're still being
charged

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
charged
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
the municipal rate uh so i i didn't mean
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
to malign exeter i love exeter i
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
practiced there for many years so um but
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
i know they do have a municipal system
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for clarifying that yeah i
 
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.589 align:start position:0%
um thank you for clarifying that yeah i
just

00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
just followed representative manjuputi
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
a clarification uh mr chair i'm one of
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors can i ask the question
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh thank you senator for
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question and clarification for
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
me was that
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
processing that's a big important issue
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
in our state and across the country
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh at this time and especially
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
following covet where the trash has
 
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
following covet where the trash has
increased

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and so
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh can you just
 
00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:44.230 align:start position:0%
uh can you just
um

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
point out how this addresses a small
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
piece of that to kind of it's a
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
one piece of the puzzle that we are
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
trying to solve
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
well i guess the only way i can
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
think that it really does address solid
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
waste management
 
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
waste management
is

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
many of the municipalities have
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
in fact hampton has worked really hard
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
on their solid waste disposal
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
and if they're
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
if all the condo associations which by
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
the way i doubt that's the case but all
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
the condo associations who have this
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
agreement between their development and
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities are doing separate solid
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
waste disposal outside of that system
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
there may not be the same level of
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
sophistication in that solid waste
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
disposal that's the only way i could
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
think that it might have some impact
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you just to highlight the fact
 
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
thank you just to highlight the fact
that

00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
we are trying to consolidate as a
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
municipal waste solid waste many of my
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
towns are really on that issue and doing
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
a great job with it
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative melvin
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
uh

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of curious you're only doing
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
this for condo associations
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.190 align:start position:0%
this for condo associations
correct

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
what about the businesses
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
what and and also what about uh plowing
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
in front of uh
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
on state roads that businesses they're
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
paying too they're paying for they're
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
also paying for the rubbish and this is
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
not included in this and why
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh the reason why it's not and thank you
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
for the question the reason why it's not
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
there you know as i mentioned private
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
roads have similar
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
agreements between the municipality and
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
the developer and and all of us i don't
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
know if you all are handling them here
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
but i'm on transportation in the senate
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
so we've had several private road bills
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
come through
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
so these are agreements that are put in
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
place i would have absolutely no problem
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
if the committee felt it was important
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
to expand this but the specific
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
problem that was brought to me by the
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
constituent was this one that's covered
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
as i looked into it i realized that
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people impacted
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
including businesses
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
condo owners
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
the renters the municipalities
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
so finding the right answer is not
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
or i didn't have the right answer and
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
i've found that committees are
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
but thorough way to figure out what is
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
the appropriate legislation
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i you know at one point i sat on 21
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
of them 21 committees commissions
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
council so i know it's a burden
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i also don't want to put in
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that's not thoroughly vetted
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
before it comes to
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
all of our attention so this was a very
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
specific issue raised by a constituent
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i kept it as narrow as
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
possible so that if if the you know the
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
senate has passed this if you all see
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
fit to pass it
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
it will be i think a very narrow focus
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the committee and something that
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
they can easily get done
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that if i mean it may be
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we discovered that it's not
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate to pass any legislation um
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the answer and that's
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
well the way this bill is right now i
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
got to be honest with you i'd have to
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
vote against it just to let you know
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
that is your prerogative you know and
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i voted for it you can vote against
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
it that's the way we work
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
but that leaves us with constituents who
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer and i still think
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
this is better than filing bad
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation i i think
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is the way in the legislature in my
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
experience after four terms here
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
this is the way
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we solve problems in the
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and make sure that the
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that's brought forward is
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the problem
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
but it's up to this committee and i'll
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
respect the decision of the committee
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the way the bill's written now it's
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
focusing on developers and
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities but would this also
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
include existing homeowner associations
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
um it certainly can it's a committee not
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
a commission so it's not meant to
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
exclude any voice um
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
it they
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
in my experience can call anybody they
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
want and it's a public forum so anybody
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
who has an interest in this
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
can come and speak and i pretty much
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee you my constituent who brought
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the issue to me will be there
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
to testify in front of the committee if
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
if we move forward with it does that
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
answer your question uh
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it it does it's
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
it just when i see it's to look at
 
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.230 align:start position:0%
it just when i see it's to look at
legislation

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
for agreements between developers and
 
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
for agreements between developers and
municipalities

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the developers are long gone
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
and an hoa may enact
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
a policy for for trash pickup i know in
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
my community of merrimack
 
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.950 align:start position:0%
my community of merrimack
um

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
specifically there's one condo community
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
where they pay property tax but they
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
also pay have to pay
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
for pickup
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
private pickup but they're still they
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
always have the option of going to the
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
transfer station
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
transfer station
to

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe dispose of large items or
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
large metal recycling things like that
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's not like they're they're not
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using the transfer
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
station but they
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
um but they do have to pay that fee for
 
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.109 align:start position:0%
um but they do have to pay that fee for
pickup

00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
pickup
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
so that that may be a component where
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have curbside pickup in
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
merrimack so
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
if we did that would then be
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i see so i think that i think the
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee is a good idea
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
i just think there may be a lot of
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
options in a lot of different situations
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
than just
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
that curbside pickup that's provided by
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you you are beautifully
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
pointing out how complicated something
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
fairly simple can become and that's why
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't feel just filing legislation
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
to impact
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
this without having a committee to study
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate and and i also
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh as several people have
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
stated including representative melvin
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
what would come out of this committee
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
could be used as a model for other
 
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:28.870 align:start position:0%
could be used as a model for other
similar

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
agreements between municipalities and
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
vendors or contractors
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that the playing field is level as
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to right now
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
in i'm not sure about merrimack but
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
certainly in some of my towns
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
and in hampton
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
people are paying for something they're
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
not getting
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
and it's simply because there was an
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
agreement at the time of the the
 
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.270 align:start position:0%
agreement at the time of the the
construction

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
so from then on everybody is paying for
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
something they're not getting and
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
rather than being
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
passing judgment myself i thought it
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for the legislature
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
to look at the issue
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
and there are many other examples where
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
this happens in municipalities and
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
this could potentially be a template for
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
next we're going to go to
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
representatives davis then
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative tripp then representative
 
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
representative tripp then representative
trello

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
trello
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
so i want to
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
ask you specifically about homeowners
 
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.510 align:start position:0%
ask you specifically about homeowners
associations

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
of which there is no
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
state law in new hampshire so how can
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
you possibly look at homeowners
 
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.030 align:start position:0%
you possibly look at homeowners
associations

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
within the penumbra of state law if
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
there is no state law governing hoas
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's one question and another question
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
specifically goes to the issue of trash
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
collection of why
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
this particular issue there are lots of
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
things that condominium owners and
 
00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
things that condominium owners and
renters

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
renters
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
and hoa owners and and renters pay for
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
quote unquote do not receive
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
yet they are able to receive them if
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
they so wish to receive them so my quest
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
my specific question is
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
are the
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
owners or renters of this specific
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
condominium of which this
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
idea came to fruition
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
able to access public trash collection
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
if they so wish
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
no is the answer they are not but
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
they're paying for it
 
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
they're paying for it
okay

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
so they have to do exactly what
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative wrong described
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
they are paying for public municipal
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
trash collection but they have to pay
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
separately to actually have their trash
 
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.510 align:start position:0%
separately to actually have their trash
collected

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
my presumption is that they could go
 
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.630 align:start position:0%
my presumption is that they could go
down

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
transfer station and drop off their
 
00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
transfer station and drop off their
trash

00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
but their neighbors who live in a single
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
family home
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
next door
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that and everybody's
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
paying for it and just to answer your
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
question about why this was the issue
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that was raised by my constituents so
 
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.069 align:start position:0%
that was raised by my constituents so
that's

00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
i was trying to address that issue i
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations you know
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured trailer parks there's all
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of groups
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
out there manufactured home
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
groups and we've seen those bills come
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
through as well but this is specifically
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
to answer the constituents concern that
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
was raised to me thank you
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
i thank you chair thank you for taking
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
like many people here i think we're all
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand what the
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
municipal trash pickup at no cost is
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
provided by hampton
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
not to the condo owners
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
but it is provided
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
within the town yes but it's not at no
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
cost there's an actual fee that's
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
attached to your
 
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.549 align:start position:0%
attached to your
municipal

00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
can i have another follow-up so so so
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's actually not free then because
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
say the homeowner
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
has to
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
register or sign up for this trash
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
pickup and he has to pay or they i don't
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
assume people's gender uh
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
they have to pay
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
an additional fee to get pic pick up
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
on their tax bill
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
yes in the sense that they have to pay
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
that fee
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
everybody pays that fee every homeowner
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
every condo owner everybody pays that
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
fee it's the condo owners who do not
 
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.470 align:start position:0%
fee it's the condo owners who do not
have

00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
let me i i'm sorry if this does sound
 
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.470 align:start position:0%
let me i i'm sorry if this does sound
complicated

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's why making any change
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what's happening
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
in this setting
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that the developer and the
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
municipality have come to an agreement
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
that allows the municipality to charge
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
that development
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
which is a condo in this case
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
a fee for a service they don't get
 
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
a fee for a service they don't get
forever

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can i'm trying to be as
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
clear as i possibly can that's what this
 
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
clear as i possibly can that's what this
is

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
and it is not simple it it seems like a
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
simple problem and and it is but when
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
you start looking into it it gets very
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
complicated very quickly which is why
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think it's necessarily right
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
for somebody to be charged for something
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
that they're not getting
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
but we do that and so the question is
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
whether this is right and i'm i don't
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
feel qualified to make that decision by
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
myself or file a bill based on that
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
without having a legislative study
 
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
without having a legislative study
committee

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much thank you
 
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.030 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much thank you
representative

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify before us just to
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing people solving a problem
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that or problems that your
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill is asking that we establish a
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee to study
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
these specific problems
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
and i see when i read the bill it's very
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
clear that we're going to we meaning
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
whoever is on the committee is going to
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
meet within 45 days what will constitute
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
a quorum and by november 1st
 
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.750 align:start position:0%
a quorum and by november 1st
2022

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
the committee shall report the findings
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
any recommendations
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the senate the clerk the governor and
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state library
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
so all we're voting on right now you're
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
asking us is to create this committee
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's it let's do it thank you
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
any other further questions for the
 
00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:05.829 align:start position:0%
any other further questions for the
senator

00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative mitchell
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
it just came to me thank you mr chair
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking in northampton we have
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
hydrant fees
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
not everybody has hydrant service but
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
your in your testimony it says the
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
question the committee the study
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee would tackle is should you be
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
paying for a service that you are not
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
receiving which we're hearing a lot here
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
but we are focused on trash for
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
condominiums i'm afraid of pandora's box
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
right no this is not opening pandora's
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
box okay because there are tons of
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
services that we understand
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
we pay for and and
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
but this one in particular was brought
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
to me by a constituent okay and
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
i felt
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
it was complicated enough as we've
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
as we figured out together today
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not something that once one
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
state rep or one senator
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
should be filing bills on before it's
 
00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:02.549 align:start position:0%
should be filing bills on before it's
studied

00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
where's oh there we are okay
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
i lived in hampton and i was on the
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
trash committee oh good and everybody
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
could have trash pickup that wanted it
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
they got two cans one recycling and one
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
for trash
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh some people and some businesses
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want it some condo association
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want it because it'd have 40
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
trash cans in front of it
 
00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
trash cans in front of it
now

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
whatever deal they made
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
is fine but they can go to the town and
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
pick up two of those cans for free
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
anytime they want
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't know if you served with dave
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
hartnett or others but
 
00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:46.950 align:start position:0%
hartnett or others but
the

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.390 align:start position:0%
the
constituent

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
brought this to me and i talked to the
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
town manager and in fact
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
some agreements were made between condo
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
developers and the town
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not just hampton this happens
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
in other municipalities but
 
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.109 align:start position:0%
in other municipalities but
where

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
those people in that condo association
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
have to contract out for their trash
 
00:54:09.839 --> 00:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
have to contract out for their trash
pickup

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
pickup
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
so they don't have
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
i believe if they made a deal with them
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
what are you looking for tax break for
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
the condos
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily i don't know exactly
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i put it in a committee was
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
to understand if we if we pass this bill
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
they get the 40 trash cans in front of
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
their building no if we pass this bill
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
we look at it and we see what is
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:40.549 align:start position:0%
we look at it and we see what is
one

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
is a solution needed
 
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
is a solution needed
and

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
two what would be that solution
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
and three as we think through those
 
00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
and three as we think through those
solutions

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
what would be the downstream impacts and
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that worth it
 
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.829 align:start position:0%
is that worth it
if

00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee the study committee
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
may come back and say
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
this does not need any intervention
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
so no there's
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is just a study committee this is
 
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.950 align:start position:0%
this is just a study committee this is
not

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to the problem and the answer
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
may be that there is no answer or that
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question unfortunately i'm
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
still a little bit confused with regards
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
these condo owners and condo renters
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
having to have to pay for a service that
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're not receiving so could you
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
clarify is
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
the payment of this trash pickup that
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're not receiving
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
is that a line item on their tax bill as
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
an add-on or
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
is it being
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
raised and appropriated through the
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's just a fine item on
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm trying to frame
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
my thought in the form of a question
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
um isn't that isn't it true that
 
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.430 align:start position:0%
um isn't that isn't it true that
uh

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
as different communities are facing some
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
have landfill
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
that can extend for next 50 years some
 
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.789 align:start position:0%
that can extend for next 50 years some
have

00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
that no space in the landfill
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
and like you pointed out one community
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
came to you
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
and there are other communities in the
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
state that are facing with municipal
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
solid waste and how they deal how they
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
charge what it is isn't that one of the
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
reasons that this commission
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh approach was taken
 
00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh approach was taken
um

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
well yes and no
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is a committee which in my mind is
 
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.870 align:start position:0%
this is a committee which in my mind is
the

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
if you've got
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
a very straightforward question which
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's getting less and less
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward but
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
if if you have a pretty straightforward
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
question like a very specific question
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
i've always found that a committee
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
rather than a commission moves
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
with alacrity
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
and can solve
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
direct questions and this
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
went with a committee rather than a
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
commission which might be unwieldy and
 
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.829 align:start position:0%
commission which might be unwieldy and
as

00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative said it could you know
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
that could go for years and and this i
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
don't think this question
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think this can be answered much more
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
quickly with a targeted committee but
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
that being said i think there will be
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
some benefit
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
towards our solid waste discussion
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm just trying to rephrase my
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
question and say
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
a committee with very specific focus and
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
a dead short timeline to answer a very
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
specific high-density dwelling
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
in communities and the trash
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
management thank you
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for lending your time
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
and your clarity in this bill and uh
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
i hope i've lended my clarity
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
i came in feeling pretty clear i'm
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
feeling a little muddy now
 
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.270 align:start position:0%
feeling a little muddy now
[Laughter]

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
our next speaker
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
and you're in support of the bill i am
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay it's on now thank you
 
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.549 align:start position:0%
okay it's on now thank you
um

00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
i have notes uh because i don't speak
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
very often in front of people and i'll
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
be a little nervous i apologize for that
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'll try to go
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
off on my own here um
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
first lived in new hampshire in
 
00:59:02.079 --> 00:59:03.190 align:start position:0%
first lived in new hampshire in
merrimack

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
a long time ago i was a child and i grew
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
up there and we had private trash pick
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
up and everything worked great it was
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
fine i
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
lived there after i went to college as
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
well and participated in
 
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
well and participated in
things

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then i bought a house in manchester
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
that i lived in for 30 years and in
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
manchester they had public municipal
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
trash pickup very different than what i
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
was used to in merrimack but that also
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
worked quite well um everything was fine
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
i got close to retirement age and i
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
started looking to downsize from my
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
house of 30 years
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i've always loved hampton and so i
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
moved into hampton and i bought a condo
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that was a bit of a dream come true
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
in hampton near the seacoast and all
 
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.069 align:start position:0%
in hampton near the seacoast and all
that

00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
and after i got involved i started
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
realizing some things that were
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
surprising to me
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
i of course downsized got into a condo
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
in order to save costs as many people do
 
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.309 align:start position:0%
in order to save costs as many people do
retiring

01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
retiring
 
01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:04.630 align:start position:0%
retiring
etc

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
in manchester i worked a little bit to
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
help with some people to help kind of
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
organize some workforce housing and
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
affordable housing etc it was always a
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
challenge as we all know in the state
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i recognize is
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
that in any large building
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
any condominium building any apartment
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
building any workforce housing building
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
there are enormous number of costs
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
associated with those buildings that i
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
never experienced in a single family
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
home in merrimack or in a single in my
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
home in uh in manchester
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
and one of those costs which seemed the
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
most kind of egregious the most odd
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
many of the condos built and apartment
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
buildings built in the last
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
number of years
the

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
the planning board and the developer the
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
planning board basically said look
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get these plans
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
approved so i've been told unless
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
you sign away the rights for all those
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
future owners
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
to not have their trash picked up
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
hampton like manchester provided
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
municipal trash pickup
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
so in order to get the plans approved
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
the developer agreed that that building
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
would not have
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
so i moved into the condo and i after a
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
couple years i started looking more
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
carefully at the budget and getting
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
involved to help run the run the
 
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.390 align:start position:0%
involved to help run the run the
building

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
as i moved into it at first i owned both
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
for a little while then i moved into the
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
condo and i recognize well
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
we pay in our tax our taxes
 
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.150 align:start position:0%
we pay in our tax our taxes
um

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
and we pay for private trash pickup but
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
i thought man i thought hampton had
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
municipal trash pickup so i investigated
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
it and learned that our building was
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
excluded from municipal trash pickup now
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
the truck goes by it
 
01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
the truck goes by it
um

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know it picks up my neighbor's trash
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
it picks up some trash at some other
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
older condo buildings but i also learned
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't pick up trash at a bunch of
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
other newer condo buildings like in the
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
last 10 15 years
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
um i called some friends in manchester
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
where they also had municipal trash
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
pickup because i was most really
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
private pickup
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
and i said what goes on there and they
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
said oh yeah we've had this problem
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
lately um
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the same thing i mean
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
the developers are signing away the
 
01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:28.230 align:start position:0%
the developers are signing away the
rights

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
for this municipal trash pickup for
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
signing away the the feature um in order
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
to get their plans approved
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
and i said well i don't understand any
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
of that so anyway i called it i talked
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
to some selectmen
 
01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
to some selectmen
and

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
probably about three years ago i started
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
this in hampton and i said hey what's
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
this about it doesn't make a lot of
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
sense to me they explained to me well
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
the developer signed away the rights i
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
said well that i get that but
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
how is that just or fair or even ethical
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
i mean for perpetuity now
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to skip this building and
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
here's the real irony in the building
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm in there's a few commercial units
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
they get their trash picked up
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
so the trash truck comes to the building
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
takes some trash
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
but won't take residential trash that
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
was i guess part of the agreement i
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
in in our case there's no fee in the tax
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill it's part of the budget you can
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
look through the town budget you see
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
trash uh pickup and disposal is quite a
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's not an insignificant amount and
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's a rapidly growing amount as we all
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
know due to the trash
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
and recycling uh cost increases
 
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.589 align:start position:0%
and recycling uh cost increases
um

01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
so i investigated it the selectman
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
basically said this is how it's always
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
been um and this is how it's going to be
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
i talked to
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
new selectmen a couple of newer ones and
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
they said oh that doesn't seem right at
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
all that doesn't seem just and i said no
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
then let me look into it get back to you
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
both cases they're looking to get back
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
to me and now all of a sudden no no this
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
is how it's been forever this is how
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be and they're not going
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
to pursue it i thought all right well
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
i didn't know what to do after about a
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
year and a half of talking with the town
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
i also talked to the town manager and
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
the town manager said we're very
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with the problem other people
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh grievance uh but unfortunately he
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
said uh he he said first you know we're
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
not going to do it it's a developer
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
agreement i said well i get that the
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
developer is long gone um and then i
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
explained that uh
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
he said well it's on private property we
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
can't come on to private property and
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
pick up the trash i said well that's
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
fair but we can put it out in front of
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
the building i mean we can do exactly
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
comply with whatever rules you have for
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else and he said so i said so if
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
i comply with those rules will you pick
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
it up and he said no
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
we won't pick it up even if you do
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what everyone else does to have
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
it picked up i said all right and he
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
went on to say that
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the selectmen
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
are fine with this the way it is
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
the uh that we've been doing it for a
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
while and there's no state law
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
or regulation that that
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't allow it and i said what do
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
you mean by that does there have to be a
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
state law to do the right thing and he
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
said well i'll give you an example in
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
education we can't do well first he said
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
well you know it's like education if you
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't have kids
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
you pay for it but you don't pick it up
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i said well i don't have any kids
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i pay for it that's perfectly fine i
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
get that i don't necessarily use the
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
library but i pay for that that's fair
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
this is different
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
i have trash
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
they won't take it it's like having a
 
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.990 align:start position:0%
they won't take it it's like having a
kid

01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
kid
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
but not allowing him to go to school
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
because of some
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
agreement the developer made makes no
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
sense to me and he said well the state
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
law we can't that can't happen
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
i said but it can happen with trash and
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
he said yes he said oh it also can't
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
happen with sewer
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
hampton also provides sewer service like
 
01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:58.230 align:start position:0%
hampton also provides sewer service like
manchester

01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the town chooses not to or
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
decides it's not economically feasible
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
to send a line up a certain street or
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
develop it into a certain area the
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
people who have
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated to pay for
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
everyone else's sewer
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
so the town manager explained this to me
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
and i said all right well it doesn't
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
seem like we're going to do anything in
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
hampton he said no
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
so that's when i started writing letters
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
to my
 
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.109 align:start position:0%
to my
senators

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
senators
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
sherman and representatives and senator
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
sherman was gracious enough to call me
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
back or talk to me about it and i
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
explained the situation
 
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.549 align:start position:0%
explained the situation
um

01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
and he said well it doesn't seem just on
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
the face of it i said no it isn't i said
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's not really an issue most towns deal
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
with because they don't have a municipal
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
trash pickup
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know that's all private and i said
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
if you have uh
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
pay per throw like exeter does
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine but in this case
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're not coming by to pick it up
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so we would be obligated to bring
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
it to the
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
transfer station the interesting thing
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
is if you try to private if you try to
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
contract out your trash service
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal transfer stations don't
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
allow a dump truck to go in and dump
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
without paying a fee
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
so our the guys who come and pick up our
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
trash not only do we have to pay for
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
them to pick it up we also have to pay
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
for them to get rid of it
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
they can't say well this part of this
 
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
they can't say well this part of this
truck

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
is from your residence to go into that
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
transfer station so you're paying not
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
only for the pickup but also the
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
disposal to the town
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
and then you're also paying a private
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
company for both the pickup and the
 
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
company for both the pickup and the
disposal

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
um and that's really what i i love the
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
more i looked at it i thought
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
i don't understand i love the state of
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i've been here my whole
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
life i find it to be generally quite
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
just and a good ethical place and i said
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
this just seems egregious this is i
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't understand this in the least as to
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
why this can happen
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
express that to a number of people and
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
the only people who seem to think it's
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
fine are the people who've just become
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
accustomed to it
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's just like their life now but
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
anybody you talk to who's not familiar
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
with this looks at it like well how can
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
this be allowed makes no sense
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's what caused this to uh i'm
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
almost done sir
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that's almost you know that's what
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what brought this to
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
my uh for here and and it's the planning
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think the reason the bill's written is
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
we've discovered it's the planning
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
boards kind of holding
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
the building hostage you know the
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
development plan hostage to
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
signing this away i don't know
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
the motivation exactly other than the
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's an issue in it it also impacts
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh they often suffer from the same thing
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
so that owner ends up paying and it
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
adversely impacts along with a number of
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
other things i've learned since i moved
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
from a house into a condo it obviously
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
impacts workforce housing as i've
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
learned mr sorrentino would you be
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions absolutely yes
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir for testifying
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the hampton new
 
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the hampton new
hampshire

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
city government web page right now
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
and it states that
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
trash containers will be issued to
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
apartments condominiums
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
residential or business
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
up to 10 carts combination of trash and
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
recycling as requested
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
and it does not mention any fee it says
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is a public service under all the
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
other public services
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
so what
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand why
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's a contradiction here
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are a number of condominiums older
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
condominiums there where they pick it up
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the bins are out front and they do
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
that uh but in the last i can't tell you
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the date because frankly i've
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
talked to the selectmen and the town
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
manager nobody quite new but this
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
practice came in to be
 
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.669 align:start position:0%
practice came in to be
of

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
not just forbidding apartment buildings
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
and new new development uh condos et
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
cetera not not uh single-family
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
homes they are all they they allow that
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
but they basically tell the the
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
developer hey look you've got a you've
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.310 align:start position:0%

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
certain items there's no fee there are
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh
previously

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that uh
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
the trash pickup is a line item on the
 
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
the trash pickup is a line item on the
bill

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
of your property tax bill do you get a
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
property tax bill
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
is there a line item on on the property
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
tax bill that says trash pickup not on
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
my bill no
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you it's uh built into the
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh one more question senator majipu i
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
mean uh representative manager putin
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just trying to
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
clarify one
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
aspect and you did mention that isn't it
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
true that there are some condominiums
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
all the condominiums and apartment
 
01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
complex that have
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
in the terms that get the municipal
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
trash pick up
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it's only the new developments that
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
have this issue
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding i've seen there
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
are condos where you can see the bins
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
are the totes are out front and they get
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
picked up and they're older ones um so
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
my i've been told that and my experience
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
is that yes
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not you say grandfathered in
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because there doesn't
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
seem to be any set of uh regulations
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
around this it's really just this
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
informal thing that seems to happen
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
between the planning board
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the developers
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
then they get together for a new
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
development it's and when i say that i
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
mean a building never a single family if
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing a single family subdivision
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's never talk of this it's only for
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
condominiums and apartment buildings
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh question i i have uh have you ever
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
been to your your local planning board
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
advise them of your concerns about this
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue i've talked to people on the
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
planning board and the zoning and the
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
the zoning before i recognize it was
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
more of a planning issue yes sir
 
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.189 align:start position:0%
more of a planning issue yes sir
representative

01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:26.709 align:start position:0%
representative
follow-up

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
have you
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
found out that
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
does it reflect the number of units the
 
01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:33.910 align:start position:0%
does it reflect the number of units the
density

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
density
 
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
density
versus

01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:13:35.199 --> 01:13:36.149 align:start position:0%
versus
the

01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh time of you know the
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years or 15 years is that
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
is there any correlation from your
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
informal thing and
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm asking is
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill is a study committee
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
so to look at what the
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
specific issue is with this trash pickup
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
so have you done any of those
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we haven't done an exhaustive search
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
of this but it doesn't seem to matter
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
there are some very you know
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
six very large condominiums with lots of
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
land it's just happening built as a
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
condominium for whatever reason and
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're excluded because they're newer
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then there are some that are much
 
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.709 align:start position:0%
and then there are some that are much
smaller

01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh much more densely packed that are
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
also excluded it seems to have more to
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
do with the timing as to how old the
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
building is basically
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh is senator birdsall in the
 
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.709 align:start position:0%

senator birdsale would like to introduce
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
welcome senator

thank you
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you committee for
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
hearing my bill for the record my name
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
is regina bartzel state senator for
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
district 19 which encompasses the towns
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
of hampstead windham and derry
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i am the prime sponsor of senate
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill 246 which pretty much dovetails
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
with senator carson's uh bill
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
this this bill basically um is a private
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
another private roads bill and it
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
regulates qualified private communities
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
this bill was a request from a number of
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
constituents of our senator carson's in
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
constituents of our senator carson's in
mind

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
where there are a lot of condominiums
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
and homeowners in new hampshire that are
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
located at what are considered private
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
roads and what this bill basically does
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
communities it's not
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
going back but what it does is it
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
requires either one of two things it
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
requires that if a builder is planning
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
on building a
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
condo community or a homeowners
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
association that is going to have
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
private roads they either put money
 
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
private roads they either put money
aside

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
aside
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
to into a trust fund to allow
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
a kind of a seed
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund for any road repairs
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
or it requires the
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
developer to go ahead and build the
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
roads up to the municipal
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
municipality standards
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
what we've been finding is and you'll
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
hear i think from one of
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
our constituents is
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
within two or three years because these
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
roads are built not to the standards of
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
the communities these roads within two
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
or three years are actually starting to
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
degrade so within two or three years of
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
a new community coming aboard you're
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
having assessed fees of i know in our
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
condo we were assessed a fee of 3 500
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
each condo to try and repair our road
 
01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
each condo to try and repair our road
but

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
we were lucky that our roads lasted
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years but in some of these new
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
communities they're not lasting
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
and when and there have been instances
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
condos or the homeowners association or
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
the private roads requested that the
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
town take over the roads and the
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
municipality said no we're not going to
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
because they're not built up to the
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
standards of the municipality so that
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
puts them at a really
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
strong disadvantage because they it's
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
like a hamster in the wheel they can't
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
get out of it they either have to build
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
the roads up to the
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
municipality standards to have them take
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
it over
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
or they have to just keep repairing it
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i will entertain any
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions i know you'll hear some
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
some of the condo and homeowners
 
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.189 align:start position:0%
some of the condo and homeowners
association

01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
members are behind me
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative guthrie
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator
 
01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator
for

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:21.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh on page
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
first page uh line 25
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
to uh through 29 or
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
231 you
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh require that they do either
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
set up a trust fund or bring
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
the roads up to standards why did you
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
give them a choice
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
instead of requiring that they do both
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
because if i could it would seem to me
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
that if they don't do the bee which is
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bringing the roads up to standards
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have trouble down the
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
road automatically well that's what the
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
seed money is for is to help
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
help the community members to
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the assessment fees
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be having so
 
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.310 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be having so
they

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
the developers either
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah either have to build the roads up
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the standards or they're going to
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
have to put money into a trust fund to
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
help the communities build those roads
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
but the question is why didn't you
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
if they do just one of them they don't
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're all set they don't have to set
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
up the trust fund
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that's it
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that is correct and if they do build the
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
roads up to the standards the
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
municipality if they want the
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities can take it over for the
 
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.750 align:start position:0%
municipalities can take it over for the
maintenance

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
so they don't need the seed money
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
another follow-up if i could i'm not
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
if they build them up to standards
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
then the the towns or cities would take
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
over the responsibility for those roads
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
but would have the
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
over here on the side to
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
expend on those roses no it only if the
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
condo and homeowners association wanted
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
them to take over see what that
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
building the roads up to the
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
municipality standards
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
typically allows a 10 in our case a 10
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
to 15 year time frame where they can
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
start putting the reserves away which
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
are required
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
in condo
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
condo associations you're supposed to
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
have i believe it's 10 percent reserves
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
for cases like this
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they don't have that built up
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
into it by the time the road repairs
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
happen so that gives the seed money
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
gives them the association some seed
 
01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
gives them the association some seed
money

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay does that help
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
well i don't i'm not in the convo so i
 
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.470 align:start position:0%
well i don't i'm not in the convo so i
really

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm still not clear
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
who has the responsibility
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the trust fund
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
oh the condo association should have the
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the church once the
 
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the church once the
builder

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
builder
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
puts the development in and if they
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
choose to put the money into a trust
 
01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
choose to put the money into a trust
fund

01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
then that trust fund in my i believe
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
gets transferred over to the condo
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
association or the homeowners
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
association so the town hasn't if i
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
could the town doesn't have any
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for doing the repair and
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
spending that money all right thank you
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.629 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
representatives

01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow up on what
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie is saying in a
 
01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie is saying in a
way

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
all it
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me that all a developer need do
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the terms of this
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
law should it pass
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
is to provide the city or town with an
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would cost to
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
replace the road
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
that that could be
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
at least one of the following options
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
right in the bill and one of those
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
following options is just provide an
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would cost and
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is what good would
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually putting money aside
 
01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
it's actually putting money aside
because

01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
the condo owners and the homeowners
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
association are responsible for
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining those roads but if they're
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
not built
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately then they're going to
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
start degrading earlier i'm not
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes and can you point out to me where
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
that they must provide this escrow
 
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
that they must provide this escrow
account

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the bill is written
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
in such a way that they can choose one
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
of these options to provide
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
they can't doesn't put money in an
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
escrow account for future residents
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
well it says on line 25
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh i met as amended by the senate no
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
city or town shall approve plans for a
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
qualified private community unless the
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
declarant agrees to at least one of the
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
following requirements for such
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
qualified private community a the
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
declarant will establish meaning the
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
developer will establish a capital
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
reserve fund of no less than 50 percent
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the cost to replace all roadways
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
within the qualified private community
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
based on the cost estimate as described
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
in paragraph two
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
and b the declarant will build all roads
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
to design standards for public ways for
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality that is approving the
 
01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
the municipality that is approving the
project

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
so they either have a choice of putting
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
money into 50 percent of the cost of
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
repairing that road into a capital
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
reserve or they can build the road up to
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
the standards
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
in my apologies i was reading it
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so my apologies thank you
 
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so my apologies thank you
representative

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you senator
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh is it not true
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
that one reason that a developer might
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
choose not to build up to
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
the town standards is because the town
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
standards require a road wider than is
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily best for the community and
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
therefore they might choose to do
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
option one of putting the money aside it
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
it could be there um there are a few and
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
i think you may hear a couple of the
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
stories that
 
01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.709 align:start position:0%
stories that
um

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
when the builder
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
when the builder goes in to put the
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
plants together in front of the planning
 
01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
plants together in front of the planning
board

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.790 align:start position:0%
board
um

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
they just they just want to get the the
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
homes built and sold
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to build the roads um
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
however they feel is best at that point
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
not what's best for the community as far
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative pimante oh yes thank you
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you senator thank you
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
what's the scope of the
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
units involved in this procedure i'm
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
sorry oh i'm sorry
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i apologize um i'm looking for
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
the condominiums that will be involved
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
in something like this now
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
and if so would it not have been the the
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
cause of the builder
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
trying to uh
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
maybe save money to make the roads not
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
wide enough
 
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.229 align:start position:0%
wide enough
possibly

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:51.030 align:start position:0%
possibly
okay

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
all right do you have a
 
01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
all right do you have a
follower

01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
follower
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
the first part of my question was a
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
scope of the
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the condominiums involved in this
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
what i'm what do you mean well how many
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually have fallen under this category
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
is it widespread throughout new
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire or is it
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
secluded in certain areas my
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
hey representative ayer
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
i was on the planning board and all
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
subdivisions have to have a 30 foot wide
 
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
subdivisions have to have a 30 foot wide
road

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's code so fire trucks can get down
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's a private road
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
because the contractor or the developer
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
wants to sell the lots cheaper if we do
 
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.030 align:start position:0%
wants to sell the lots cheaper if we do
this

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
this
the

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
developer's not going to pay this money
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
you are the person that buys the house
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to say you buy a house there
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay an extra 200 000
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
over a 30-year mortgage to pay for that
 
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.229 align:start position:0%
over a 30-year mortgage to pay for that
road

01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
he's not going to lose money that's why
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
they make a private road but the private
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
road still has to be 30 feet wide by
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
code so you can get a fire truck and an
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance down here at the same time
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
but you also have keep in mind first of
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
all that a lot of these condos
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
within three or four years their roads
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
are starting to deteriorate so now
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're they're looking at 3 500
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
assessment to their their
 
01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:21.910 align:start position:0%
assessment to their their
home

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
and there are some condominiums and i
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
think you'll hear it especially the one
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
in londonderry where they built the
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners or they built the homes now
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're talking about putting a business
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
the the road comes to i think 102
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken and then they're
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
talking about putting a like a little
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
village district and the way the
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
entrance into that village district is
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
on the homeowner's road
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be responsible for
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining that as well and they're
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
they it's used as a cut through as well
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
the public uses it as a cut through so
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is some responsibility
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up go ahead
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a private road
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that means the planning board you
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
know was involved in putting in that
 
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
know was involved in putting in that
little

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
store or whatever it is
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the road goes it's a
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
private road
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
so the town has or the contractor has no
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
no responsibility in taking care of that
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's built in
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know to build a private road it's
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
still got to be 30 feet wide and but
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to hot top it
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
unless they want to but you'd pay for
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
that it would be tacked on to the lot
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
it divided out if it was 10 lots
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
whatever that extra road cost
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
that 50 thousand dollars would be tacked
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
onto that lot and then if you have a
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
mortgage and you're paying for you know
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
say 25 000
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
for 30 years it comes out to a lot of
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
money representative do you have a
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
question for the senator
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
what's that do you have a question for
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
no i'm done okay i i just want to remind
 
01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:00.790 align:start position:0%
no i'm done okay i i just want to remind
everybody

01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
that uh we should be
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
speaking in the form of questions for
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
those who are testifying
 
01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.189 align:start position:0%
those who are testifying
yes

01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative matt giori
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
it says in the in the bill and the
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that no city or town shall
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
approve without so does that mean and i
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
think i'm following up on my friend's
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
comment about being on a planning board
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
which i am also
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
that this automatically has to be a
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
condition of approval for that site plan
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding so there are
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's follow-up chairman why i never do
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
that i never do follow-ups that felt
 
01:29:39.679 --> 01:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
that i never do follow-ups that felt
funny

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
funny
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
so when we read off in our planning
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
board meetings the standard conditions
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
for approval this would then be included
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
in that a standard condition of approval
 
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
in that a standard condition of approval
is

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
what is in this bill for only for
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners associated only right and
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
condominiums okay thank you that was a
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
very good follow-up
 
01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
very good follow-up

01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh for private roads are there any
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
standards do
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
engineering um associations have
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
standards for building private roads or
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
is it purely up to the decision of the
 
01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
is it purely up to the decision of the
developer

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's various types of private
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
roads as i found out when i i did this
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
because there are actually private roads
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
where there's only four or five homes
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
and they have to maintain it dirt roads
 
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.070 align:start position:0%
and they have to maintain it dirt roads
so

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it doesn't um private roads
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
isn't specifically for homeowners
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
associations in condo um but these are
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
for any
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
future development of the homeowners
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%

manchapuri does this
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
distinguish between detached condos or

01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
i notice that you specifically
 
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.430 align:start position:0%
i notice that you specifically
state

01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.709 align:start position:0%
state
that

01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:56.719 --> 01:32:08.070 align:start position:0%
that
this

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
you mean to maintain them in the future
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
only if the home homeowners requests it
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to the town doesn't
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
so given that's the situation
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
this is essentially just requiring that
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
they plan to replace their votes
 
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.709 align:start position:0%
they plan to replace their votes
yes

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative guthrie
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
for taking another question
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
am i correct in saying that this does
 
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.390 align:start position:0%
am i correct in saying that this does
not

01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
stop the developer for bringing these
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
roads out to the town standard if the
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
planning board requires it
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
little i know about the planning boards
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility but i think that many
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
planned wars even our town your town of
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
my town
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility particularly
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
they're very tight on making sure that
 
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.229 align:start position:0%
they're very tight on making sure that
there's

01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:21.270 align:start position:0%
there's
enough

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
space on the
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
roads for fire and
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
an ambulance service so
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are many towns that
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
would do too
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
option but still do the first so you
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
even though you don't require that
 
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.110 align:start position:0%
even though you don't require that
both

01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
putting down the 50
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the town standards isn't correct
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
that you the
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
developer could do both
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
if they would like to yes
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and keep in mind too
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
because i do live in a condo and a few a
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of years ago we had looked into
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
possibly getting a it being a public
 
01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:03.350 align:start position:0%
possibly getting a it being a public
road

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the requirement was we would have to
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
remove the the force that was behind our
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
condos so that the
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
um fire station could have an egress
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
into it and we chose not to we chose to
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
keep the um the private road private
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want the um
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
the force removed from behind our condos
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you senator we really appreciate
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
you taking the time to explain this bill
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
to us and thank you we have a lot of
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
people behind you that i think are
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
wanting to speak to it oh boy
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are in the audience
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and want to speak to this bill
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
i ask that you'd be brief
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that consider what's already been
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
discussed and if it's been discussed
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
already i would just say that yeah i
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to do what senator birdsall said or
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
john's uh
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
idea over here rather than
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
going through it
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i only mention that because we only
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
have so much time today and
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
i know many of you may have driven quite
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
a while to get here so i i do recognize
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
a while to get here so i i do recognize
that

01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
so next we're going to have
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
to to speak is edgar uh bourgeois is
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
that right did i pronounce that correct
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
almost correct all right
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
you asked for three minutes go right
 
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.390 align:start position:0%
you asked for three minutes go right
ahead

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
uh

01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
as a homeowner in a
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
economy association in manchester i'm
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
here as vice president of the
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
association and we are madison heights
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
unit owners association
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
we've been in existence since 2004
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
and speaking
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
road maintenance and other issues that
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
the city then
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
does not provide for services such as
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
following our streets garbage collection
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
and of course the maintenance of the
 
01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
and of course the maintenance of the
roads

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
now our association has been in
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
existence since 2004
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
however we've already had to repave our
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
method that they used to to construct
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have many issues we've been
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
very fortunate that most everything was
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
done um
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
in a good
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
high quality manner however again to go
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the points of
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
why some of these
 
01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
why some of these
development

01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.189 align:start position:0%
development
developers

01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
developers
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
choose to go private roads is that
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a cost savings
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
but it also increases density
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
the owners do not get any benefit of
 
01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
the owners do not get any benefit of
that

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
increased density
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
the developer chooses to
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
keep all of those additional profits
 
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
keep all of those additional profits
so

01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
as part of our example here today
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
is in 2028 our 18 members
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
had to pay 4950
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
for snow removal from our streets
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
we choose not to have that person clear
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
additionally we have to pay 5170
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
the cost to replace our road
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
was 30
 
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.149 align:start position:0%
was 30
587

01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
587
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
in a mere 13 years
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
i know some examples that i've heard
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
roads deteriorated sooner than that we
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
were fortunate we got 13 years
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
our concern is
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
without forcing the developers
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
to either improve the quality of these
 
01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
to either improve the quality of these
roads

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
or set aside some kind of
 
01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
or set aside some kind of
reserve

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
we are left to have to pay that
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
and 30 000
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
in 13 years
 
01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.149 align:start position:0%
in 13 years
is

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's illogical from from a homeowner's
 
01:38:26.719 --> 01:38:28.390 align:start position:0%
it's illogical from from a homeowner's
perspective

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
we are not a multi-story condominium
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
association we are detached condos 18
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
individual owners
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we are made to
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
suffer the consequences of
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's the municipalities or
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's the developers alone that
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
are making these choices
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's kind of irrelevant i think we need
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
some protection mr bourgeois
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
your three minutes have expired
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry your three minutes have
 
01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry your three minutes have
expired

01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have questions will you take some
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee i will
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
did the developer disclose these uh
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
future costs to you when you're looking
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
to buy a uh
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
your condominium
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
i wasn't one of the original owners
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years ago
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
and nothing in the declarations the
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
bylaws or any of the declarations
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes follow up
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
where were you aware that you would have
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
to be paying uh
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
trash pickup costs
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh plowing costs
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
and other things that was made
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that we would have to
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
pay snow removal
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
so so the only uh disclosure that uh was
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
not apparent was that uh there would be
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
road road replacement costs and that it
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks very much
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify before us today mr
 
01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:18.070 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify before us today mr
bourgeois

01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
bourgeois
 
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.669 align:start position:0%
bourgeois
bourgeois

01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
bourgeois
 
01:40:19.679 --> 01:40:20.790 align:start position:0%
bourgeois
um

01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
my question is in regards to this bill
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this is
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
for communities going forward
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a retroactive
 
01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.550 align:start position:0%
this is not a retroactive
action

01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as well
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
so follow up please
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is then you're you're
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
coming forward based on your experience
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
to save some future homeowners
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
the current pain you have
 
01:40:47.679 --> 01:40:49.189 align:start position:0%
the current pain you have
exactly

01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
the reality is we
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
almost never have the opportunity to go
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
back and retrace ourselves
 
01:40:55.199 --> 01:40:57.350 align:start position:0%
back and retrace ourselves
however

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
if we if we don't understand some of the
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
drawbacks of the way things are done
 
01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:05.109 align:start position:0%
drawbacks of the way things are done
currently

01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know additional people additional
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
citizens will be forced to be paying
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
these costs and
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
let's face it when we're looking at a
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
new home all we see is
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
the colors and decorations and whatever
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
take the time to look beyond that
 
01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.550 align:start position:0%
take the time to look beyond that
and

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised how many people do not
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
even read
 
01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
even read
the

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
kind of my laws and declarations it's
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
in so many cases
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
i'm part of the board of directors now
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh in our association and i'm always
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
amazed how many people do not even
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
realize they've got a copy
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the time of signing they purchased
 
01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
at the time of signing they purchased
themselves

01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of disconcerting to hear that
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it is that you're
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
signing up for
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
but again it's it's the reality and
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that through our
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
presence here today that
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere somehow future owners won't
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay the same price we did mercy
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
miss you
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr blizwell for your testimony
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much all right thanks
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
for having me
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
hope everyone has a great day
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
next is uh
 
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
next is uh
matt

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
matt
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
nieswender i said i don't know if i
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
you've asked
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
for two minutes
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
yeah two to three minutes i think is i'm
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to try to make this brief bullet
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
and just go through the points right
 
01:42:47.679 --> 01:42:48.629 align:start position:0%
and just go through the points right
ahead

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
so basically um i'm the president of our
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
road association in barrington my name
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm also is of the new hampshire private
 
01:42:57.679 --> 01:42:59.590 align:start position:0%
i'm also is of the new hampshire private
roads

01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
care alliance and
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
on a private road for 22 years when i
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
first moved in there was no road
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
association there was no money seven
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
years later our road's a mess i decided
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
to create a association and start trying
 
01:43:14.239 --> 01:43:15.189 align:start position:0%
to create a association and start trying
to

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
hit the road taken care of and
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of this bill and
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
in situations like this if this bill had
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
existed prior to me
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh buying in to a private road without
 
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
uh buying in to a private road without
any

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh association or rules or anything not
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
knowing all these hidden costs
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good start to kind of
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
make a difference in the state of new
 
01:43:42.719 --> 01:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
make a difference in the state of new
hampshire

01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
it'll also keep the roads in better
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
shape that are private roads for
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles and
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
for buses and for kids walking
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know to their homes on the street
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
it'll keep things safe
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
it also will help keep up property
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
values for the home so that towns can
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
collect higher
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
taxes or regular taxes
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
and it will also
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
make the towns more desirable if the
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
roads are decent and they're not
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
falling apart or in disrepair
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
so in that case everyone wins
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill there's no cost to implement
 
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
this bill there's no cost to implement
it

01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the towns you know they just have to
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
basically put it into their
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
zoning and cleaning board
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
rules to have
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
these two
 
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.109 align:start position:0%
these two
items

01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
adopted to either create a capital
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
reserve fund or
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
build the road to town standards and
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
to answer one of the earlier questions
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
somebody asked you know if it was one or
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
two houses the bill says four or more
 
01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.550 align:start position:0%
two houses the bill says four or more
houses

01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
houses
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will help
 
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will help
um

01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:57.119 --> 01:44:58.149 align:start position:0%
um
also

01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
problem in new hampshire around
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria in our lakes and there is
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
a house bill
 
01:45:08.679 --> 01:45:10.310 align:start position:0%
a house bill
1066

01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
1066
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is coming up next week
 
01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.830 align:start position:0%
which is coming up next week
for

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
um discussion and
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
basically it's about cyanobacteria
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
being formed on our lakes and the cause
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
of this cyanobacteria basically is from
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
road runoff and poor drainage and that
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
typically that's typically um where a
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
lot of these private roads are they're
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
around these lakes and waterways and it
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
causes pollution and brings foreign
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
materials into the lakes which
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
brings the cyanobacteria to start
 
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.189 align:start position:0%
brings the cyanobacteria to start
blooming

01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
blooming
 
01:45:45.199 --> 01:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
blooming
and

01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
the des is
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
being asked to have a plan to address
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
sign open movements and we feel that
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
this bill can actually help with this
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
issue because
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
if you do private roads town standards
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have proper drainage mr
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
nice one could could you wrap oh you're
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
about three and a half minutes just just
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
about there and
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
it will protect our wildlife our fish
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
our loons
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
and all that so
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
in summary basically
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's a win-win for
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody it protects future people from
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
getting into bad situations
 
01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:25.510 align:start position:0%
getting into bad situations
and

01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
it allows the towns to
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
look better and be able to
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know not be
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
poor road conditions for
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
getting fire trucks at hand winces or
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
police down some of these roads that
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
might be in the atmosphere
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for your time and i'm
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions yes so
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question sir
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i received a lot of email with
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
regards to the
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
the totality of the bills we're hearing
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
today and i do read all my emails
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
you did send a letter via mail as well
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
as follow-up by email and i looked at
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
the website that was referenced so i'm
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
hoping you could answer this question if
 
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:14.870 align:start position:0%
hoping you could answer this question if
my

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
citation is correct
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that i saw on the website a
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
statement saying that there are two
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
northeastern states that currently have
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
statutes that address this issue with
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the roads being built to proper standard
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
did i see that on your website and if so
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
could you please
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
share with me
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.149 align:start position:0%
 
somewhat

01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is an issue
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
there are probably more than two that um
 
01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.109 align:start position:0%
there are probably more than two that um
exist

01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
in talking with some of the people that
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
i actually
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
made phone calls to here um last week
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
they informed me that you know their
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
their town actually does
 
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.470 align:start position:0%
their town actually does
um

01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
um
require

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be built to
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
town standards so when a new road is
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
being put in
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
so that you know they can last last
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
longer and have less problems
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
early on
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
i don't recall
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
the name of that town i do know that the
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
town of barrington does
 
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.830 align:start position:0%
town of barrington does
have

01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
some stuff in place for
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
private roads and
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
they realize it's an issue and they give
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
a five percent
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
break on the land
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
property value
 
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
property value
evaluation

01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
because you're on a private road and
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
they know that you have to
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
pay extra money to maintain your road
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i i was interested in looking at
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
model legislation from other states
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
um to compare it to what the provisions
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
are in this bill so
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
if the state of new jersey has
 
01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.790 align:start position:0%
if the state of new jersey has
some

01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
documentation on
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
private roads that
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
is similar to bill
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
sb 250 which
 
01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
sb 250 which
basically

01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
to be given
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to private roads
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
and each private road would have to
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
submit a portion of
 
01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.149 align:start position:0%
submit a portion of
or

01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to submit what they
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
spent and they would get a portion of
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
that back as a credit
 
01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:56.870 align:start position:0%
that back as a credit
towards

01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
houses that are on that part of it
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
i believe also the state of maryland
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
also has
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
some statutes in place
 
01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
some statutes in place
and

01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact details but i
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
believe it is on our
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
website and it is on the letters um the
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
website is on the letter that i sent and
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's also on the bottom of my email
 
01:50:22.719 --> 01:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
it's also on the bottom of my email
so

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm over here in
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
this corner
 
01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.390 align:start position:0%
this corner
um

01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
a quick question
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
how many miles of private roads exist in
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire do you have any idea
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
well i know that the majority of private
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
roads in my town of barrington is over
 
01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:55.189 align:start position:0%
roads in my town of barrington is over
50

01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the number of private roads
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
within the state i know that there are a
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
lot of private roads within the state
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
and as i said many of them exist around
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers and ponds and things
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
like that where
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
you know had these roads in place for
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
many years and
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of them were dirt and probably not
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
built to town standards you know many
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.109 align:start position:0%
and um
so

01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have an actual number as far as
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
how many there are and i'm not really
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
sure if there's a way to
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
really get that data and provide how
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
many roads are out there versus you know
 
01:51:37.199 --> 01:51:38.470 align:start position:0%
many roads are out there versus you know
public

01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
public
private

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
oh one more question
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair really quick i just
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
want to clarify something that i think i
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard before you said if a town approves
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
this i don't read that the bill that
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to make sure okay
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and uh
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
who

01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
well thanks for having me can everyone
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
my name is arie pollock i'm an attorney
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
at the law firm of gallagher callihan
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
and gartrell in concord
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm also a registered lobbyist for the
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire home builders association
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
i've got written testimony coming around
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
the home builders association opposes
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
i've had 25 years as a land use attorney
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with what senator
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
sherman said earlier today with respect
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
to his separate bill that what might
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
seem simple on the surface certainly can
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
become very complicated and i think this
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
subject matter fits into that category
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
quite well
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill would require is any
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
private road system built upon any
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
nature of waiver any
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind of waiver whether it relates
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
frankly to the structural stability of
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
the road or things like lighting
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
landscaping signage
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
any type of waiver the bill does not
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
distinguish would require a cash escrow
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
of 50
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the road replacement value so let's
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
just put some examples out there
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
if the replacement value based upon the
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
cost to install in the first place was
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
something on the order of a million
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and that would not be a surprise
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
for a private community infrastructure
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
road system
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars into
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
escrow let's assume there are ten homes
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
in that development that would be a
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
passed cost to the buyer of each of
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
those 10 homes of at least fifty
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money it as was
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the bill is designed
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
to apply to any development with more
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
than four units if your example is a
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars spread over five homes
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of the items we want to make sure
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
the committee is aware of is that home
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
owners associations are designed to
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
govern these types of issues and so at
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
the same time as the question was asked
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
earlier whether or not the buyer coming
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
in has taken time to understand their
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
obligations relating to infrastructure
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's also incumbent on these governance
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
boards to be planning ahead for these
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
types of expenses and i'm not suggesting
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
that there aren't horrible examples out
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
there where infrastructure has failed
 
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.709 align:start position:0%
there where infrastructure has failed
far

01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of its planned obsolescence far
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
ahead of what those capital needs and
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
improvements may have been scheduled for
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
or when they would have likely occurred
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
but those governance boards are required
 
01:55:13.119 --> 01:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
but those governance boards are required
by

01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
statute and by declaration of
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
association to be planning ahead for
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
these expenses and i know the sponsor
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
made reference to her experience in a
 
01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.470 align:start position:0%
made reference to her experience in a
condominium

01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of having received a
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
special assessment of thirty five
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to do road repair work
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
number one i think that might be the
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
unusual occurrence and number two it
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
would be significantly less than what a
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
buyer would be paying to help a
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
developer fund this escrow we we've
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony that there is a
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
significant network of private roads
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire this problem
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
would occur in many places
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
and as
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
this committee has focused on on a
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills this year the hou the
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
state is already in the midst of a
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
historic housing crisis
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
this would result in the passage of
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
costs from developers
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
to buyers and exacerbate the
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
affordability challenges
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
i won't restate what's in my letter
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
but i did want to go through a couple of
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
items in the bill language itself as
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
and just point out for you the 50
 
01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
and just point out for you the 50
number

01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned applies to any type of
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
waiver whether that waiver relates to
 
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
the structural stability of the road or
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
not the road might be narrower than a
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
public road would require or the right
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
of way might be narrower there may be no
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
provision for sidewalks and it might
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
simply be the style of community that
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
they don't need those attributes doesn't
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
mean what's underneath the traveled path
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the road is any different or lesser
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
than what you would find on a public
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
road and some public roads fail
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
prematurely as well it depends entirely
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
upon the circumstances of what was there
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the existing condition and how things
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
were constructed
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
to identify 50 regardless of the type of
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
right of waiver that may have been
 
01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.030 align:start position:0%
right of waiver that may have been
applied

01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very arbitrary number
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
there are many standards that have
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with structural stability
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other item is
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
there's a portion of the bill at the end
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
on page two line five talks about the
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
expiration or sunset of the capital
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
reserve fund once it's put in place
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
it causes it talks about a number of
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
triggers that might cause that to occur
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
the interesting omission there to me is
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
what happens to the money when the
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
sunset occurs
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
who gets it does it get paid back to
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is the developer still involved
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
in some fashion which likely would not
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
be the case what role does the
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
municipality have in policing the return
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
of those funds these are not questions
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
that are easily answered maybe this is
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
the subject of a study
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just not a good idea or not
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
ready or applies only in particular
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
examples that are not statewide problems
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so as a result of that the home
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
builders are asking that you find the
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill itl or at a minimum
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
send it on another track where it can be
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
worked on with more detail thank you
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
pollock for taking my question
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
um i understand from your letter and
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony that you are opposed to
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the one of the two options the
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
capital reserve option are you also
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the language and the bill
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would require those private roads
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
to be built to town standards
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
right so i'm not opposed to roads being
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
built to town standard but i am opposed
 
01:58:38.239 --> 01:58:40.149 align:start position:0%
built to town standard but i am opposed
to

01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
punish or disadvantage a developer from
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
coming in with a different idea
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
may be more appropriate in a private
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
community setting that again
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
requires a waiver that has nothing to do
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
with the structural integrity of the
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
road system
 
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:09.669 align:start position:0%
road system
representatives

01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
can you educate me as to which new
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire rsa protects or pertains to
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations i am not aware
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
of any that do
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations um i know
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
condominium forms of government which
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
also are similar to homeowners
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
associations i think is chapter 356b
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
um and there are also
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
our provisions relating to private
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure under chapter 674 the
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.199 --> 01:59:53.669 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now no
 
01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:02.790 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now no
so

02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's specific to
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations but i do know
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's significant governance relating
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
to condo forms of government and for uh
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
land use planning road design planning
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
board regulations and specifications for
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
development but i just want to be clear
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
that in your testimony you did state
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
that there were laws governing and
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
protecting homeowners associations
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps i misspoke what i'm talking
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
about is the declaration that forms the
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association and that
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
typically would be a document referred
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed rather by the planning board in
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal subdivision process and
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
placed on record for any home buyer to
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you concerned
 
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you concerned
um

02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that the first home
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
owner pays
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
a number fifty thousand dollars in
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
sells the home before
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
any work is done on that road and now
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
there's fifty thousand dollars in a fund
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
left to
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine heck for the record
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i represent the new hampshire
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipal association and i will be
 
02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
municipal association and i will be
brief

02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
brief
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
we are here to comment on the bill we
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
have no position
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
however we did want to
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank the senate for including a
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
provision that would define capital
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
reserve fund not to have the same
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
meaning as in rsa 35 however we still
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
are concerned that the use of that
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
language combined with the fact about
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
the escrow account and it being held by
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
the homeowners association along with
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
the developer there could be a gap in
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
time in which the subdivision is
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
approved under the provisions of this
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill and the homeowners association
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
isn't fully formed and we don't want the
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipality to think for some reason
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
because it says capital reserve that
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
they would have some responsibility in
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
holding it and our previous suggestion
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
was to kind of just
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
change the term infrastructure fund any
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
other term but the financial tool that
 
02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.149 align:start position:0%
other term but the financial tool that
our

02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are so used to using
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
just to keep any confusion out
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
sure under the um
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
d.o.t road standards town standards
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
are not mandated by state law
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
however many towns most towns do follow
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t road standards but there could
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
be variations in road standards and that
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
we also did express that concern
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
in the senate so there is no standard
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
statewide for road construction it could
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
be town by town and we just wanted to
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that was also
 
02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
addressed so that's all i have if you
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
have any questions for me
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
anecdotally i have heard that part of
 
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.070 align:start position:0%
anecdotally i have heard that part of
the

02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
issue with the
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
associations like condo associations or
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
whatever is that
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the developer will hold
 
02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.550 align:start position:0%
the developer will hold
multiple

02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
units and therefore have multiple votes
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned that
 
02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.109 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned that
the

02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
as you said the the escrow fund or the
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
escrow uh money is is controlled by the
 
02:03:53.119 --> 02:03:54.229 align:start position:0%
escrow uh money is is controlled by the
uh

02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
the association you know in a situation
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
where uh the developer holds multiple
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
votes he can he can uh
 
02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:02.790 align:start position:0%
votes he can he can uh
improperly

02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
improperly
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
maybe use the money do you think that's
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
a concern
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think we want to get

you know
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
our organization is a statewide
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that was formed probably two
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
and a half three years ago now
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
for this you know in part for the
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
the security the durability and
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
reliability of private roads
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh over 500 supporters throughout the
 
02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:50.470 align:start position:0%
uh over 500 supporters throughout the
state

02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh everywhere every portion every part
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that covers about right now
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
about 100 little over 100 cities and
 
02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
about 100 little over 100 cities and
towns

02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
people all live in different types of
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
communities not restricted to over 55
 
02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
communities not restricted to over 55
communities

02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
residents with families
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
they all live on private roads they all
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
have their
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
own uh stories to tell and it's
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
it would be virtually impossible for all
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
of them to be here and tell this story
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
so i'll tell you a little bit about my
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
situation and
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
figure out how many times the story is
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're here today because myself matt who
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
testified a little while ago and a
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
member of my board of directors invited
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
senator carson senator birdsale to come
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
to our community
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to show them the private
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
roads and educate them about what we
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
know what we've learned over the two and
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
a half years we've been doing this
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
we showed them our roads we have five
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
roads that probably about
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
a mile and quarter worth of roads it's a
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
very condensed uh property
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
the stand-alone condos they're not
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
attached or anything
 
02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:03.669 align:start position:0%
attached or anything
and

02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:03.679 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
and
we

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably about a year and a half ago now
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
we had to spend about four thousand
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
dollars to seal
 
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
not seal coat crack fill the roads two
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the roads because they're falling
 
02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:17.030 align:start position:0%
of the roads because they're falling
apart

02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
apart
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
these roads you know my understanding as
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
a layperson is that
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
public roads last 20 25 years
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
ours are falling apart we don't get that
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
much traffic even though we are a cut
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
through uh from
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
state highway 102 to a main road that
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
goes out our back entrance and a lot of
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
people use it
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
because they want to avoid traffic
 
02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
because they want to avoid traffic
lights

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
lights
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
we showed them that we have uh or told
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
them that we have three commercial
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
easements on our private roads
 
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of baffling that you have a
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
private road with you know easements to
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
commercial properties uh on our private
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
road one of those commercial properties
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
is is in the process of being
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
planning for development we don't know
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
what's going to go in there but we don't
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
want to spend what we've been told is
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
about eighty thousand dollars to fix our
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
our private our two roads that need
 
02:08:06.719 --> 02:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
our private our two roads that need
repair

02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
repair
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
until we know what's going in there
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
because we'd like to try to do a good
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
neighbor thing where maybe they'll help
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
us pay if they're going to use our road
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
to get entrance to their property
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll help us with it um
 
02:08:22.239 --> 02:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll help us with it um
but

02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
there are there are
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people probably a couple
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
thousand people as we estimate that we
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to reach it that live
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
on private roads that have issues for
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that they haven't come
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
forward yet and the reason why we're
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
here is to
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh prevent
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
future private road owners from falling
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
into the trap that we fell in
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
unknowing until year three or four what
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're really up against
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
when you're when you move into a private
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
road community
 
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.109 align:start position:0%
road community
um

02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
i i think i might be in a position to
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of the questions that maybe
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
haven't been answered representatives
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many miles of
 
02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
in my community there's about a mile and
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
a quarter
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
i've measured that myself as far as
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
statewide i don't know that anybody has
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
those figures i've contacted a lot of
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
towns and asked
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know how many private roads they
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
have what the names are the prime so we
 
02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:37.669 align:start position:0%
have what the names are the prime so we
could

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
reach out to these people through
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
mailings or whatever
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
some towns have
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
can identify private roads and some
 
02:09:44.159 --> 02:09:46.310 align:start position:0%
can identify private roads and some
can't

02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
that answers your question follow up
 
02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.270 align:start position:0%
that answers your question follow up
um

02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have in your community 1.5 or
 
02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.069 align:start position:0%
you have in your community 1.5 or
whatever

02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
whatever

no idea um
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
londonderry has
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 over 55 communities and several
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
other communities
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
with family residences that that have
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
private roads
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr goglia
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not working
 
02:10:24.159 --> 02:10:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not working
just

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
speak loudly we'll get it looked at it
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your testimony you
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
had stated that with regard to the
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
condo development that you reside in
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
that there are three commercial
 
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.189 align:start position:0%
that there are three commercial
easements

02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
easements
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
does your homeowners association
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
and perhaps as well as the organization
 
02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
and perhaps as well as the organization
nhprta

02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
nhprta
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
do they have a seat at the table with
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
regard to the planning process and the
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
approval by the planning board
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to approval of any of these
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
commercial developments
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the reason why i ask that is that so
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
the wear and tear
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the private road
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
gain access to these commercial
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
developments will that be taken into
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
account when that plan
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
exist none of us live there
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and now
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
i know our board is monitoring
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
the development of these commercial
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:11:48.239 --> 02:11:50.229 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
the homeowners the whatever association
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
you're in had had no part in granting
 
02:12:00.719 --> 02:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
you're in had had no part in granting
them

02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
were was there disclosure that these uh
 
02:12:06.639 --> 02:12:19.589 align:start position:0%
were was there disclosure that these uh
easements

02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
as existed else previously said you're
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%

02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions
 
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.270 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions
for

02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%

and judy supports the bill and judy
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm judy bastian i live in the lakes
 
02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
i'm judy bastian i live in the lakes
region

02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
region
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know the answer to how many
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
groups there are they're private
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
i do know there are over 30
 
02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.510 align:start position:0%
i do know there are over 30
developments

02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
developments
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
that are private
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i do live in a private community i'm
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
here in support of this build which has
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
no effect on us
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
weather in new england as we all know is
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
all the taxpayers participate in the
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
repair class
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
some private street developments have
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
resumed funding for street maintenance
 
02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.390 align:start position:0%
resumed funding for street maintenance
however

02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
when a private street is of such genetic
 
02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.229 align:start position:0%
when a private street is of such genetic
construction

02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
it may mean that the funds set aside or
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
insufficient to accomplish those repairs
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
before the repairs occur much earlier
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
than expected
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
in this case each homeowner in the
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
development is charged a special
 
02:14:35.599 --> 02:14:36.790 align:start position:0%
development is charged a special
assessment

02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
and they have to pay the cost of the
 
02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:47.589 align:start position:0%
and they have to pay the cost of the
repairs

02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
it could be said and i'm sure it is
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the requirements of this bill
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
it will be built in to the cost of the
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners of the future
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
based on that requirement sure it would
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
cost more because the builder is going
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
to pass it on
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
but most of the buyers start off with a
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
garbage so the extra cost is built into
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
the mortgage
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the construction
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
would be part of that
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to special assessments
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
that catches hold on as my surprise when
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
you go into a private development
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're not really thinking about am i
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to be assessed a big fee because
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden my street needs repair
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
you don't think about that but when you
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would provide some assurance
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
that your private street was
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
constructed from
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
or provide some funding for future
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps early needed maintenance
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
and doesn't maintain public and private
 
02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:07.030 align:start position:0%
and doesn't maintain public and private
sectors

02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the witness yes
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question i hope that you can
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
answer it uh the question that i that
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me is
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
even if a a a private road
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
in a condo was built to municipal
 
02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
in a condo was built to municipal
standards

02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
does that
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
then therefore
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
require or necessitate that the
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
municipality will accept that road just
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
but we have a lot of delivery vehicles
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
now particularly in the last two years
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen more of the ups and we've
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
seen more fedex and we have seen more of

02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have our roads finished until
 
02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:55.509 align:start position:0%
we didn't have our roads finished until
2021

02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
our roads deteriorated over that period
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
of time we were concerned
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
that our declarant would not finish the
 
02:19:06.479 --> 02:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
that our declarant would not finish the
roads

02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
roads
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 we decided to take him to
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
court to seek legal action
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
will you suspend for a minute the uh
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
the microphones seem to have kicked in
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden as you walk through the
 
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden as you walk through the
door

02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
please continue after a two-year legal
 
02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
please continue after a two-year legal
battle

02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
battle
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
we settled with our declarant
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
out of court to have him vacate the
 
02:19:35.439 --> 02:19:36.469 align:start position:0%
out of court to have him vacate the
property

02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we could bring in a new developer and
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
finish our roads
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately we struck a good deal and
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
our roads were finished in 2021
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
there have been questions here about the
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association's responsibility
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
a new buyer coming into a 55-plus
 
02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:56.950 align:start position:0%
a new buyer coming into a 55-plus
community

02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
he receives the condominium documents
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
which are the declaration the bylaws and
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
they're to the best of my knowledge no
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure in any of those documents
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
about the development being on private
 
02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:11.429 align:start position:0%
about the development being on private
roads

02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
roads
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
the homeowners association doesn't
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
communicate with a new buyer because we
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't know who the new buyer is
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
until they close on the unit
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
so again it's the buyer beware they
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
should be aware of it but this bill
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
would definitely help protect buyers
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
coming into 55 plus into any development
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
with private roads going forward
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
mr goldwater is it i mean um
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
robert bob for skier bob's fine but is
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
it do you have evident any evidence that
 
02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:42.389 align:start position:0%
it do you have evident any evidence that
the

02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:42.399 --> 02:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
realtors that are
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
moving the property are helping disclose
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
the requirements
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
i do not but they are required to
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
provide any prospective buyer
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
with the condominium documents
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i thought at one time they are
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
required to get the
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
buyer to sign a document that says they
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
have received the documents i don't know
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
if that's the case or if that is still
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
happening but until the buyer closes on
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
the property the homeowners association
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
isn't involved we have one of the top
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
realtors in the state that wants to ask
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily want to ask you a
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
question i want to clarify that that you
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
are correct
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
as a real estate agent in the state of
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you are required to give a
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
disclosure to any buyer of the property
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is filled out by the seller
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
which details
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
the material facts of the property
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
some sellers will write down this is the
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners association this is a private
 
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
homeowners association this is a private
road

02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
road
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
some will not just based on their
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
awareness not on any wanting to be a
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
falsehood and you are correct it's
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
usually not in a declaration of bylaws
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
or rules
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you can see it when you turn
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
onto the roadway though because it will
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
say the name of the street and then it
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
will say private road not in our
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
development okay i understand i live in
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
dover and many of our private roads
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
do say
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's a forward
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's happened
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
maybe since your
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
community has been developed thanks for
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
i just would like to leave you with this
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any other questions you
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
my last meeting with our declarant
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
he had agreed to finish our roads
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
our lawyer said that's fine but would
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
like to have him inspected to make sure
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
that done right his response was the
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association has no say in how
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
i do my work
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's my responsibility and i'll do it
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
the way i want
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's why i think this bill is
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
important i think it sets a standard
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
going forward that helps protect the
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
public representative manchapudi
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mister for
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just a
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
clarification you said
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
your community was built over a period
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
of time or
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
in 2017 to
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
around 2007 it may have started a little
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
bit before then uh a follow-up yes uh is
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
was it in phases you knew it was in
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
phase two so
 
02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
the roads were not built until
 
02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:19.349 align:start position:0%
the roads were not built until
2021

02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
no the roads were finished in 2021 i
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
think the last uh
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
we had one phase remaining but there are
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
six phases five phases were completed
 
02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:31.349 align:start position:0%
six phases five phases were completed
probably

02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
2016 2017
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's why in 2019 when nothing was
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
happening to finish the roads we be
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
became concerned and that's why we
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
decided to take our declarant to court
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
we thought that was the only remedy that
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
we could seek to get our roads finished
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%

02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%

it's so nice to put in a bill that you
 
03:14:35.910 --> 03:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%

03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
in various communities in new hampshire
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
towns are currently suing their property
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
owners and property owners are suing
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
their towns
 
03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
over the homeowner's ability to rent
 
03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
their property on a short-term basis
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
recently a judge presiding over several
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
of these court cases pleaded with the
 
03:15:13.750 --> 03:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
state legislature to step in and set up
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
some statutory parameters
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
for both property owners and
 
03:15:18.239 --> 03:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
for both property owners and
municipalities

03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
the headline of the union leader
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
article read judge who will weigh in on
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
conway's regulation of short-term
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
rentals would like to see legislature
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
set statewide property
 
03:15:33.439 --> 03:15:35.269 align:start position:0%
set statewide property
policy

03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
this came out after i put in this bill
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
i encourage each of you to heed the good
 
03:15:45.990 --> 03:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
judges plea and pass senate bill 249 it
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
passed the senate commerce committee on
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
a 5-0 vote and on a voice vote on the
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
senate floor
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 is modeled on accessory
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit bill this legislature
 
03:16:01.030 --> 03:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
passed several years ago
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
in that bill the legislature mandated
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
that towns had to allow a property owner
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to construct an accessory
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit within their home
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
however that bill also granted towns a
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
great deal of leeway on how they would
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
like to regulate these adus
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
same idea was put forward with senate
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill 249.
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
towns would be prohibited from using its
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
zoning power to eliminate the use of a
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
single or two family structure from
 
03:16:37.590 --> 03:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
being used as a short-term rental and
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's the rub for most people
 
03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
that's the rub for most people
however

03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:16:43.830 --> 03:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
towns would retain all existing
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
authorities to regulate those rental
 
03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
authorities to regulate those rental
properties

03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
towns could regulate parking
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
noise sanitation health and safety in
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
the same manner they can currently do
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
they simply
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
simply cannot ban
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
these from being
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
used in this manner
 
03:17:08.110 --> 03:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
additionally senate bill 249 grants
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities to new rights
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
first they can mandate all short-term
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
rentals register with the town
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
and charge a fee for doing so
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
currently state statute requires
 
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
long-term rentals to register with
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
accounts but does not grant similar
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
authority on short-term rentals
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
i basically copied that statutory
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
language on long-term rentals and made
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
it applicable to the short-term rentals
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
and if a rental property becomes a
 
03:17:40.469 --> 03:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
problem then sb 249 grants the town's
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
ability to rescind that registration
 
03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 also grants towns the
 
03:17:50.469 --> 03:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
right to inspect a single and two family
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
home something which is currently
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
expressly prohibited in state statute
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
i am a big supporter of private property
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
rights and granting the government the
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
right to enter a home is not something i
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
particularly like
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 even grants towns the
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
ability to charge a fee for that
 
03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
ability to charge a fee for that
inspection

03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
however this bill is designed to balance
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the rights of
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
private property owners in the needs of
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
towns to regulate for health and safety
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
of residents and visitors
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
no one is going to like everything in
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
including me and that's the point
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
no one's going to be fully happy but
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to do what is necessary
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
please let's listen to judge
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
ignatius plea and pass senate bill 249
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
the issue with short-term rentals is not
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
going away
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
the result of inaction by the
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislature will continue litigation
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
costs for municipalities and property
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
owners both
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
both sides need to give a little to
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
create a common sense compromise
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
now there are folks here that
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire association of
 
03:19:06.630 --> 03:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
association of realtors who are very
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the intricacies of this
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill and i would ask that the chair
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
would call on them to answer your
 
03:19:17.910 --> 03:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions in detail thank you mr chair
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh are there any
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator while he's
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.190 --> 03:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:19:30.870 --> 03:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so my question is
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit multi-part and it
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
pertains to
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
the wording and the meaning of words
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
used in this bill so in particular i'm
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
interested in understanding better what
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
is meant um
 
03:19:47.590 --> 03:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
lines five through nine on page one of
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
structure and short-term rental
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
um as well as conforming or
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
non-conforming so those terms so when i
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
read this bill structure it's not clear
 
03:20:02.150 --> 03:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
to me what it is could it be a barn
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
could it be
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
a permanent tent
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
and what is exactly meant by short-term
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
rental does that imply
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
like a residence at which a person would
 
03:20:16.630 --> 03:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know sleep or domicile
 
03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
and also on lines seven through eight it
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
is specified um
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying language but i find it still
 
03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:26.229 align:start position:0%
clarifying language but i find it still
confusing

03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
single family or two family building or
 
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
structure so that there again it's i'm
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
not clear what is meant by a structure
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then lastly what is meant by
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%

thank you for your multiple choice
questions

03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'll answer number one
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
this is for single and two unit
 
03:20:52.239 --> 03:20:53.670 align:start position:0%
this is for single and two unit
properties

03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:55.349 align:start position:0%
properties
and

03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the intent is it's
 
03:20:58.160 --> 03:20:59.590 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the intent is it's
also

03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
short-term rental is
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's anything under
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
six months
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
03:21:10.950 --> 03:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
anything over six months i'm not exactly
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
sure the board
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
the association could answer that
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh does not have to pay rooms and meals
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
tax so it's anything that rooms and
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
and your last question was

03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
nine
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
structure is conforming or
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
non-conforming i asked that you'd hold
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
so um just to be clear
 
03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
you said that a um a structure that
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
therefore cannot be like a like a a barn
 
03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:55.030 align:start position:0%
therefore cannot be like a like a a barn
or

03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
like a
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
a portico type thing where somebody
 
03:22:01.990 --> 03:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
would rent that for a day
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
for an event a party a wedding just to
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
be clear so i'm not exactly sure to tell
 
03:22:10.950 --> 03:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
you the truth because
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
a mini home or a
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what kind of structures
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
precluded from this i don't i don't
 
03:22:26.070 --> 03:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
think it's intended for you to put a
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
tent up in your yard this is not for
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
commercial use
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
such as weddings and all that
 
03:22:35.670 --> 03:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
this is for
 
03:22:41.910 --> 03:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:22:49.920 --> 03:23:04.150 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry

03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator for
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this bill that
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
would allow municipalities to restrict
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals in areas of their
 
03:23:16.239 --> 03:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals in areas of their
town

03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
in certain neighborhoods or zones or
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
would they have to allow short-term term
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure but not
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
exactly sure i think it would um
 
03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
be open
 
03:23:36.560 --> 03:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
be open
throughout

03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear let's say there's uh
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
i'll just take hampton beach for an
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
example right
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals could be would be
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
allowed throughout the town
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that are far away from the
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
beach maybe near schools or something
 
03:24:01.670 --> 03:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to have short-term
 
03:24:02.950 --> 03:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
rentals there
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to just be
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
restricted to that beach area so laconia
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
restricted them
 
03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:10.830 align:start position:0%
restricted them
in

03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
areas because we've had short-term
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
rentals historically for ever in the
 
03:24:16.319 --> 03:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
rentals historically for ever in the
state

03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
and it's only until recently where
 
03:24:23.190 --> 03:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities have been
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
restricting them
 
03:24:26.479 --> 03:24:28.790 align:start position:0%
restricting them
so

03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.429 --> 03:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this would allow
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
because i'm not an attorney even though
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
i look like one
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if this would allow them
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
to restrict in certain areas with the
 
03:24:44.469 --> 03:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
verbiage here or not to tell you the
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
truth i would ask
 
03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:48.469 align:start position:0%
truth i would ask
yeah

03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator mr
 
03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator mr
sir

03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:24:54.309 --> 03:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
i i just have a quick question and it's
 
03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
kind of like what what uh certain words
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
mean what does i know what's an
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
unorganized place on line four
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
what is that i think
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
unorganized that's uh
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what's considered
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh way north of here where
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's not either a town or a city
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's like three hour drive for you to
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
get to one of them places so i drive
 
03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
three or three hours north and then i'm
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
there and then you'll be there okay
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:33.910 align:start position:0%
thank you

03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator for
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:25:40.710 --> 03:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
how does this um delineate
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
airbnb which is a newer concept
 
03:25:44.479 --> 03:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
airbnb which is a newer concept
and

03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
would that come under short-term
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
those would be short-term rentals there
 
03:25:53.190 --> 03:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
would be airbnbs or short-term rentals
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
so that would be part of this included
 
03:25:56.479 --> 03:25:58.389 align:start position:0%
so that would be part of this included
representative

03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator
 
03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you feel that a short-term rental
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
is an expansion could be an expansion of
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
a non-conforming use
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
i don't uh
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
so a short-term rental is for staying
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
over in someone's property
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
i currently
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
have the right anywhere
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
if i own a home to allow anyone i want
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
to stay there for any period of time
 
03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:30.710 align:start position:0%
to stay there for any period of time
correct

03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's only when i
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
change it and decide to collect money
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
for doing so that i have a problem with
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:43.349 align:start position:0%
the municipality
correct

03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to do is say
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that i can do it
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
for compensation
 
03:26:54.309 --> 03:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
what i have the legal right
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i absolutely understand i'm just
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
as a representative to the planning
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
board if we have a non-conforming use we
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
have to grapple with whether or not
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is an expansion of a
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use and i'm unclear about
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
rights that you have to do that
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
create and create the condition of
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
expansion which then requires
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
in my town planning board review right i
 
03:27:31.190 --> 03:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think it does i mean but that's
 
03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
my opinion um
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
so use is for residential is for staying
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
there it's for living there
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the use doesn't change it's just
 
03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um the the the local
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
planning board ordinances that
 
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative banjori referred to
 
03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
are different for every town and city
 
03:28:09.429 --> 03:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree yes
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
and isn't it the point of those local
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances to
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
best meet the needs and demands of those
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
local places and not the job of the
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
state to determine what is proper for on
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
a local basis in some instances yes and
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
in some where
 
03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
in some where
um

03:28:31.190 --> 03:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
some people feel it's an infringement on
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
then the state might step in and say no
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
you you have the right to regulate this
 
03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:42.150 align:start position:0%
you you have the right to regulate this
but

03:28:42.150 --> 03:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
this goes too far and we're saying
 
03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have the right
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear you're saying that
 
03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:50.790 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear you're saying that
local

03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
towns local municipalities
 
03:28:55.190 --> 03:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
should not have the right
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
to regulate
 
03:28:56.960 --> 03:28:58.150 align:start position:0%
to regulate
uses

03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
uses
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
under their ordinances so
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is there's a point
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
where no government no section of the
 
03:29:09.510 --> 03:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
government should infringe on the rights
 
03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:10.309 align:start position:0%
government should infringe on the rights
of

03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
on certain rights
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator for coming thank

next we're going to hear from
 
03:29:41.830 --> 03:29:41.840 align:start position:0%

03:29:45.190 --> 03:29:45.200 align:start position:0%

03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%

and i am
 
03:30:45.429 --> 03:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
i represent carroll county district 2
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
the towns of conway
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
eaton chatham
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the unincorporated
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:58.389 --> 03:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
let me start
 
03:31:00.630 --> 03:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
03:31:03.190 --> 03:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
that in conway
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
we had on the ballot
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
to see if the town of conway
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the vote on that
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
warrant article
 
03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
warrant article
was

03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:31:23.279 --> 03:31:25.990 align:start position:0%
was
674

03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
674
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:30.960 --> 03:31:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:31:32.800 --> 03:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
opposed
so

03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
the town of conway
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
has said
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
they do not want short-term rentals
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
there was also another article on the on
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
the warrant that said
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
if we have short-term rentals do you
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
want them regulated
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
and the answer to that was an
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelming yes
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
but there but people
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
voted for that particular amendment
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
not knowing
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
if in fact the ban on short-term rentals
 
03:32:13.830 --> 03:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
was not going to pass
 
03:32:13.840 --> 03:32:15.030 align:start position:0%
was not going to pass
so

03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
that was kind of belt and suspenders
 
03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
i did not i'm sorry i didn't run enough
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
copies of the amendment
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
for everyone but
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
i noticed that someone was going to get
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
them this is a
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
a huge amendment
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
it simply says
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
the kearsarge lighting precinct
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
established in 1957
 
03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:46.950 align:start position:0%
established in 1957
per

03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
per
 
03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
408 colon one
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
is exempt from the provisions of
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph six
 
03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
and paragraph six is what was just being
 
03:32:57.760 --> 03:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
and paragraph six is what was just being
discussed

03:32:59.110 --> 03:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals what are they and so
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
on so it's basically saying that
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
the kearsarge lighting precinct is
 
03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:11.590 align:start position:0%
the kearsarge lighting precinct is
exempt

03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
from this whole
 
03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:15.110 align:start position:0%
from this whole
mess

03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
mess
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
so i know that there's probably no one
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
sitting at this table
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's ever heard of the kearsarge
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
lighting precinct
 
03:33:29.990 --> 03:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
it is located as one of the small areas
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
we were granted
 
03:33:36.399 --> 03:33:37.590 align:start position:0%
we were granted
zoning

03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:38.950 align:start position:0%
zoning
rights

03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
by the legislature
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
in 1957
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
so our little precinct has had
 
03:33:46.960 --> 03:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
so our little precinct has had
zoning

03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
03:33:49.279 --> 03:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
zoning
ability

03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
ability
 
03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:51.670 align:start position:0%
ability
since

03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:33:51.680 --> 03:33:57.190 align:start position:0%
since
1957.

03:33:57.190 --> 03:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
in most cases our
 
03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:00.790 align:start position:0%
in most cases our
zoning

03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances are stricter than the town of
 
03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.229 align:start position:0%
ordinances are stricter than the town of
conway

03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
conway
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
but we believe we we we actually live in
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
a very
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
although it's called residential it's
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's pretty wide open
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
and looks more like a
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
a little country town
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
than it does like part of conway
 
03:34:25.040 --> 03:34:26.870 align:start position:0%
than it does like part of conway
so

03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
we also
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
passed a zoning ordinance that said
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to rent short term
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
the house had to be owner occupied
 
03:34:47.279 --> 03:34:49.030 align:start position:0%
the house had to be owner occupied
so

03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:51.910 --> 03:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
this was long before
 
03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:54.830 align:start position:0%
this was long before
airbnb

03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
vrbo home away
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
we recently had a court case
 
03:35:08.830 --> 03:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:10.550 align:start position:0%
that was
uh

03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
it was ruled in our favor
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
by the same judge ignatius
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
that uh the senator was talking about
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
and by the way she's a very nice person
 
03:35:21.279 --> 03:35:22.630 align:start position:0%
and by the way she's a very nice person
um

03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
that court case supported
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
our ability for
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.190 --> 03:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
owner occupied short-term rentals so
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
the first thing i ask
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
is that you support this amendment based
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that ruled we could zone
 
03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:53.590 align:start position:0%
legislation that ruled we could zone
ourselves

03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have to pay attention to
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
what conway or
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
bartlett and by the way we spread over
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
two towns what conway and bartlett had
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's number one
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
the second thing is as the bill is
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
there are holes that you can drive a
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:25.030 --> 03:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
one of them is that it doesn't talk at
 
03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
one of them is that it doesn't talk at
all

03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
about declarations and covenants that
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations and condominium
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
associations have registered with the
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
register of deeds
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
in the uh the covenants that
 
03:36:43.439 --> 03:36:44.309 align:start position:0%
in the uh the covenants that
that

03:36:44.309 --> 03:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
are on my homeowner for my homeland
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
association say that we cannot have
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
they have to be i think i think it's
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
they have to be 30 days or something but
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
a thing like that but you can't have
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
just a weekend guest
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
whereas the condominium association
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is located within the homeowners
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
association says you can have short-term
 
03:37:12.399 --> 03:37:14.550 align:start position:0%
association says you can have short-term
rentals

03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
so each homeowners or condominium
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
associations in their declarations and
 
03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:22.150 align:start position:0%
associations in their declarations and
covenants

03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
covenants
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
have made
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
about short-term rentals
 
03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:28.830 align:start position:0%
about short-term rentals
and

03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
again to me
 
03:37:33.510 --> 03:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
if we are
 
03:37:36.389 --> 03:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
if you want to fix this legislation
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
you need to say something about
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
condos and homeowners associations and
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
that their declarations and covenants
 
03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
that their declarations and covenants
rule

03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing that is a little
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
interesting and i didn't read it this
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
way before
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
but it says short-term rental
 
03:38:01.349 --> 03:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
means any single family or two-family
 
03:38:01.359 --> 03:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
means any single family or two-family
building

03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
so guess what
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
that eliminates about 98 to 100 percent
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
of all condominiums
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
because i don't know of any condominiums
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
that are only two people or
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
a two-family building
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
so you need to think about that
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
because i
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that senator french
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to eliminate the possibility of
 
03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:32.790 align:start position:0%
wanted to eliminate the possibility of
condominiums

03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
condominiums
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
being excluded
 
03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:35.830 align:start position:0%
being excluded
from

03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
i have some additional testimony with me
 
03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
i have some additional testimony with me
uh

03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
for people that could not attend today
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
provide these copies of this to the
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
the chairman but one is from
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
one is from
 
03:39:06.150 --> 03:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
vicki and john mcdougall
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the third one is from
 
03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:10.469 align:start position:0%
and the third one is from
chris

03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
chris
 
03:39:10.479 --> 03:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
chris
werner

03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
werner
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
and uh yes they are all residents of
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
conway that just in
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
case you were wondering so i thank you
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i will be sure to answer any
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative manchakudi
 
03:39:31.030 --> 03:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
again you mentioned
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the in your testimony about airbnb is
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
more a recent
 
03:39:41.120 --> 03:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
more a recent
um

03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
phenomena and this you know whatever was
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
before didn't include or think about it
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
but some of the communities have made
 
03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:53.429 align:start position:0%
but some of the communities have made
accommodation

03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
for airbnb
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
because they have a different it's a
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
short-term rental it's a different
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
way of
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
offering opening a home or a community
 
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
up for short term
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
so how
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
have you considered
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
if there is any policy that has worked
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
in a community
 
03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:16.710 align:start position:0%
in a community
to

03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
still give the local communities an
 
03:40:19.279 --> 03:40:20.950 align:start position:0%
still give the local communities an
opportunity

03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:40:23.670 --> 03:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this at a community
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
local control
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
versus the state
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
no i have not
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
for example i i mentioned that conway
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
had voted on this the kearsarge lighting
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
precinct also voted on whether or not
 
03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
they wanted short-term rentals
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
and the answer in both cases as i
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
indicated was no
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
and i think the other thing that
 
03:40:52.229 --> 03:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
is probably quite unusual
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
is that our zoning ordinances have been
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
around since 1957
 
03:40:58.080 --> 03:40:59.750 align:start position:0%
around since 1957
and

03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:03.189 --> 03:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the change for owner occupied
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
occurred in
 
03:41:04.640 --> 03:41:06.309 align:start position:0%
occurred in
1982.

03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
1982.
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll just tell you the reason that
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
the kearsarge lighting precinct
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
came to the legislature for zoning
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
is because
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
the fathers in the town of conway wanted
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with zoning in 1957 so we
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
said okay fine
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
will just go around you and that's what
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
we did
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so coming back to that uh
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative don't you think as we
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
have always done local control
 
03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
enhancing local control
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
might thank you representative
 
03:41:59.110 --> 03:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate you oh i'm sorry
 
03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative tripp

thank you mr chair
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on a previous
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
question you know being a
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
planning board person
 
03:42:14.479 --> 03:42:16.389 align:start position:0%
planning board person
uh

03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:42:19.510 --> 03:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
the question previously was about
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know it uh
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get this whole thing
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
03:42:27.279 --> 03:42:28.630 align:start position:0%
in my mind
apparently

03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
03:42:30.640 --> 03:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
are

03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:42:32.160 --> 03:42:33.670 align:start position:0%
are
structures

03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
structures
 
03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:34.870 align:start position:0%
structures
that

03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
exist in residential areas versus
 
03:42:41.110 --> 03:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
commercial areas where like uh
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
well you know it's interesting there are
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of motels and hotels and airbnbs
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know her every bed and breakfast
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that all advertise on
 
03:42:58.870 --> 03:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
any one of these platforms
 
03:42:58.880 --> 03:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
any one of these platforms
so

03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know they're
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's another
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
media medium for
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
what we
 
03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
think of as
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
a place to stay it's just another medium
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.479 --> 03:43:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
like i said it it seems to me that
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill is speaking to
 
03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:29.269 align:start position:0%
what this bill is speaking to
is

03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:43:29.279 --> 03:43:30.469 align:start position:0%
is
uh

03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
that are in residential areas and not in
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
commercial areas like motels would be
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that so that would be essentially a
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
i am the one place i've never sat is on
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
the planning board
 
03:43:46.640 --> 03:43:48.870 align:start position:0%
the planning board
okay

03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
i would uh i would think that what you
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
just said is correct
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
all right so i have one one last one
 
03:43:58.150 --> 03:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's this is more of a statement than
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
a uh question but uh uh have you ever
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
heard of duplexes
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes those are two unit condos
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
which is you said that you've never
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
heard of a two-unit condo so
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
i call them duplexes not condos
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
this is an opinion question i can't hear
 
03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:25.510 align:start position:0%
this is an opinion question i can't hear
you

03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is an opinion question
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
in your opinion do you think we should
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
get involved
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
with the planning boards and the zoning
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
boards in the whole state
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
to decide what they should do with their
 
03:44:37.359 --> 03:44:38.710 align:start position:0%
to decide what they should do with their
town

03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
no i don't
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:44.950 --> 03:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
i would if there if there are no other
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
questions i would
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
i would strongly urge the committee
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
03:44:51.439 --> 03:44:52.229 align:start position:0%
to think about
uh

03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
putting this bill into interim study
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
because i think that there are plenty of
 
03:44:57.520 --> 03:44:58.710 align:start position:0%
because i think that there are plenty of
questions

03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be answered
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
prior to this
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to the
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%

[Music]

03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%

03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%

03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm out of respect for the clerk
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
because i know what the clerking is like
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
on a committee
 
03:45:57.520 --> 03:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
on a committee
okay

03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay committee members i oppose senate
 
03:46:01.199 --> 03:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
okay committee members i oppose senate
bill

03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
bill
249

03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
249
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
not only as a representative but as a
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
member of the berlin city council
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
i have given you a letter informing the
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee that the berlin city council
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
voted monday april 4th unanimously to
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
oppose the legislation before you
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
a gross assumption is made in the bill
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the legislation presumes
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
erroneously that a one-fixed solution
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
fits all municipalities
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
not all towns or cities are alike
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
berlin for example only has 37 units
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
for a city of its size yet the north
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
conway area within a smaller with a
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
smaller population has greater than 600
 
03:46:42.720 --> 03:46:43.910 align:start position:0%
smaller population has greater than 600
units

03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
the bill will do away with berlin's
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
ordinances already in place
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
if passed senate bill 249 would prohibit
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
local zoning ordinances from regulating
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
the location of short-term rentals
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
in brief
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
the issue is one of local control
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i encourage the members of the
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee to take into consideration
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
the latter when deliberating senate bill
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
to 49
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time in
 
03:47:10.399 --> 03:47:12.229 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time in
consideration

03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
in closing i will not entertain any
 
03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:17.429 align:start position:0%
in closing i will not entertain any
questions

03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
not out of you know disrespect for the
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but i believe
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
that any a number of
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
individuals testifying behind me will
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%

03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are issues in the bill which i
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
advisable for the committee to take into
 
03:47:42.479 --> 03:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
advisable for the committee to take into
consideration

03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and not itl the bill that perhaps put it
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
in interim study so i can see pros and
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%

i was compelled to to to come to concord
 
03:49:24.070 --> 03:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh today and and it's great to be at the
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%

problems with the mics up here we have
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
problems in portsmouth um but you guys
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
are in the weeds of what affects
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
everybody in new hampshire on a on a
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis and that's what i get
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
to feel like i get to do in portsmouth
 
03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
is really hear
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
from constituents
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot that has been said and
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
will be said on on local control i
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
believe in local control but what i want
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
to point out today
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
is is really how this bill is an
 
03:50:00.199 --> 03:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
is is really how this bill is an
anti-affordable

03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
anti-affordable
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
housing bill
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
and it is so
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh because i think in the the senate
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a discussion of two
 
03:50:09.359 --> 03:50:10.389 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a discussion of two
markets

03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
markets
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
a short-term rental market
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
and a long-term rental market
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
and one of those markets is more
 
03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
and one of those markets is more
lucrative

03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
lucrative
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
than the other
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
and as we've seen nationwide as airbnb
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
has been allowed to happen in
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities the price of rent has
 
03:50:28.399 --> 03:50:29.670 align:start position:0%
municipalities the price of rent has
increased

03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
increased
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
and our own assessor believes the cost
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
of housing both for purchase of housing
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
and rental units in portsmouth will
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
increase if this bill is passed
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's precisely because
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
there is no provision in it for owner
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
occupancy i i think it was senator
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
french who said he believes in property
 
03:50:48.880 --> 03:50:49.750 align:start position:0%
french who said he believes in property
rights

03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
i believe in property rights if this
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill was limited to
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
the ability of a homeowner say for 180
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
days a primary resident from renting out
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
their home
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
or as it was pointed out in in in conway
 
03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
that there were requirements um i i
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
might be supportive of this but what
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
this will allow
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
is speculators llc's corporations to
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
come in
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
buy houses
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then flipped them into short-term
 
03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
rental units thereby exacerbating an
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
the opposite well the the other point
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
that that might have been made was well
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
there'll be more room in meals tax
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
revenue that the cities can enjoy
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
but that's not true
 
03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not true because as you know
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the calculation for the roman meals tax
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
is based on residents
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's not based on tourism believe me i
 
03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
would love it if it was based on tourism
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so the more that we
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
promote long-term rentals at the sh at
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
the uh promote short-term rentals at the
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
expense of long-term rentals we will
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the money that portsmouth and
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
many other municipalities would receive
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
from uh the rooms and males revenue
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
finally you know um oh just one quick
 
03:52:10.070 --> 03:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
point on the uh expansion of of
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use uh this bill is
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting in that it calls the
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
and actually states that it's going to
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh raise a room and meals tax but
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
somehow make it not a commercial use so
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
the idea that you'd be expanding a uh
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use i think you'd be
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
expanding it to an actual commercial use
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
but they state that it's not and i don't
 
03:52:30.160 --> 03:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
but they state that it's not and i don't
know

03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
if you can just state that by a
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
commercial use and since it's simply
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
stated as a non-commercial use it's not
 
03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
a commercial use and i think you know
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
there'd be questions and maybe legal
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
challenges to that but the real reason
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
visit portsmouth
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have a perception of
 
03:52:53.520 --> 03:52:54.389 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have a perception of
portsmouth

03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
mine is a little different
 
03:52:58.630 --> 03:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
i was born in portsmouth 38 years ago
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
my dad is from portsmouth his
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
grandfather graduated the third grade uh
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
worked for the city all his life and and
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
his grandfather or his father my
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather came down from nova
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
scotia and worked at the morley button
 
03:53:11.279 --> 03:53:12.469 align:start position:0%
scotia and worked at the morley button
factory

03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
factory
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
and he
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
and he was called the lawyer not because
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
he had any formal
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
schooling but because he could read and
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
the other folks in the button factory
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
brought them the legal documents that
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
they saw or the paper and he informed
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
them so they call them the lawyer maybe
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
inspired my father to become an attorney
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
there is two portsmouths there's the
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
portsmouth that that gets you know put
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
all over mur
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
and there's the portsmouth that that
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
comes into my office
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
that asks me what am i going to do
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
when a property changes hands to an
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
outfit out of massachusetts and the
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
rents go up 200
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
a month and they've been given 30 days
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
notice or 45 days notice that that's
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
i worry that this bill is going to throw
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
gasoline on the affordable housing
 
03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
crisis that it's going to tear
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
communities apart
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
not out of any ill intent of the bill
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
but just a lack of understanding of what
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
this will truly have on impacts of
 
03:54:14.229 --> 03:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
communities when we don't have
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
long-term residents any longer
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so with that i'd ask you to oppose
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
or study it and figure out how you can
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
make it better so that it could actually
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefit the residents that we have in
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire now and not favor outside
 
03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
new hampshire now and not favor outside
development

03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
and investment that is simply going to
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh turn our
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
turn our communities into
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
a giant hotel
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mayor uh
 
03:54:42.150 --> 03:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes go
 
03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:46.309 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes go
ahead

03:54:46.309 --> 03:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
um hi thanks for taking my question um
 
03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:50.389 align:start position:0%
um hi thanks for taking my question um
so

03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:50.399 --> 03:54:51.269 align:start position:0%
so
the

03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities you listed
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
that you said you'd be in favor of would
 
03:54:56.080 --> 03:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
that you said you'd be in favor of would
be

03:54:57.030 --> 03:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:57.040 --> 03:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
be
um

03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
killing it or putting it to further
 
03:54:59.680 --> 03:55:00.790 align:start position:0%
killing it or putting it to further
study

03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
to find something else that would work
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
can you think of i'm wondering if third
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
possibility would
 
03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:06.870 align:start position:0%
possibility would
um

03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
rep representative umberger had an
 
03:55:11.349 --> 03:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
amendment for us for example could you
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
think of
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
ways we could possibly
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
amend this to address the issues
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
described or is it just too much to well
 
03:55:24.150 --> 03:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
i want to stay in my lane and turn you
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
know you guys are doing hard work of
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislating here um and i have faith and
 
03:55:31.269 --> 03:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
confidence in uh in this committee
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
putting their heads together with what
 
03:55:35.429 --> 03:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
i've addressed i think uh residency
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know i understand
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
that portsmouth we got a lot of work to
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
do in a lot of land
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
use and and study we've changed a lot in
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
the last
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
well 38 years certainly but in the last
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
10 years we've changed a lot
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to pretend to be able to
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
to to do your job
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
i do understand that the expectation in
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that you know our
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
houses pay our taxes the property tax
 
03:56:03.750 --> 03:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
they can't work for us
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
this could you know provide ability so
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
that homeowners could meet that
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
challenge i wouldn't want to take that
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
away from them and will work in
 
03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to understand that this bill
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now is not close uh
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to doing that so anything that would be
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
centered around residency requirements
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
is one person and i don't know if i
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
speak for any other mayor but myself
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
would be something that i would like to
 
03:56:25.199 --> 03:56:25.990 align:start position:0%
would be something that i would like to
see

03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for mr chair i have a question
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
oh you do okay go ahead
 
03:56:34.870 --> 03:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chu thank you
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
mayor for taking my question
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
if it's a short-term rental versus
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
long-term rental
 
03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:48.070 align:start position:0%
long-term rental
a

03:56:48.070 --> 03:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner or anybody that has a property
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
to rent
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
can make more money with the short-term
 
03:56:55.520 --> 03:56:56.790 align:start position:0%
can make more money with the short-term
rental

03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
rental
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
than our long-term so which
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
precludes that person to
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
not use it for short term so it
 
03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:06.550 align:start position:0%
not use it for short term so it
encourages

03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
encourages
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
like you said the affordable housing
 
03:57:09.439 --> 03:57:11.110 align:start position:0%
like you said the affordable housing
option

03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
in your community versus if it's
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
no short-term rental
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that the
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
the studies that have been done have
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
been pretty clear that rents will rise
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
when short-term rentals are
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
unregulated new hampshire is a you know
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't pay to be fast especially
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
or first when it comes to municipalities
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
most municipalities if you look at
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's in texas or california or
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
even internationally they've recognized
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
the air in their ways in in allowing
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
this to happen unfettered for any number
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
of days of the year because it takes
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
it simply takes uh rental units off the
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
market i understand the private property
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
rights exist for residents i just i i
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to weigh them in the balance of the
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
community against those
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
those would be rights that would be
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
granted to llc's corporations outside of
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and certainly
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
outside of portsmouth to come in and
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
raise the the property values and then
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
our taxes because we use the comparison
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
home model in terms of assessments
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't see the benefit to new
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire in this
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you mayor
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
mr mayor is it your
 
03:58:30.479 --> 03:58:32.710 align:start position:0%
mr mayor is it your
assumption

03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
03:58:32.720 --> 03:58:33.750 align:start position:0%
assumption
that

03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:33.760 --> 03:58:35.349 align:start position:0%
that
most

03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
units which are used for short-term
 
03:58:37.840 --> 03:58:38.950 align:start position:0%
units which are used for short-term
rental

03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
rental
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:58:43.269 --> 03:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
long-term rentals
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
were they not being used for short-term
 
03:58:45.359 --> 03:58:46.389 align:start position:0%
were they not being used for short-term
rentals

03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if if we precluded
 
03:58:51.510 --> 03:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals from
 
03:58:51.520 --> 03:58:53.110 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals from
happening

03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
somebody might not want
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
to rent out any portion of their home i
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
could i could certainly assume that um
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
but i i could see that
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
at least in portsmouth
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it's more shadow because there's it
 
03:59:07.510 --> 03:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
happens outside of our
 
03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
of our of our jurisdiction
 
03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the ability to enforce is is limited
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
um i think some of those would you know
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
i've seen people simply buy houses to uh
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
to to convert them that we're actual
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
tenant paying houses and this is
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotal and not maybe super helpful
 
03:59:26.950 --> 03:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
but convert those it's not as hard as as
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
one might think to convert a long-term
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
rental into a short-term rental it takes
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of towels maybe soap management
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
company um they're gonna come in and be
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to do that and where the desire and
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
the market is there and it is there in
 
03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
portsmouth it is there in some other
 
03:59:45.990 --> 03:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
tourist locations it certainly is a
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
great incentivization uh to do that it's
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
also a great incentivization for people
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
that do not live uh in the community to
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
hire an outside firm um that would be
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
managing many dozens of these properties
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so i i couldn't say that you know if
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
there if short-term rentals were banned
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the state that uh we would solve our
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
housing uh situation i'm sure some of
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
them just would not they'd just be
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
absorbed um in and they wouldn't you
 
04:00:15.189 --> 04:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
know they wouldn't like the idea of
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
renting them out long term uh but i
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that's universally true
 
04:00:18.800 --> 04:00:20.469 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that's universally true
either

04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you mayor for your
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you've had some tough
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions i worry about this one
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
not to worry
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
as a mayor
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
overseeing a large new hampshire city
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if if you have um
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
a hedge fund
 
04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
out of dubai
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
that owns several blocks
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
in downtown portsmouth
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
where there are many many short-term
 
04:01:01.439 --> 04:01:02.710 align:start position:0%
where there are many many short-term
rentals

04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
and under the bill's provision
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
you reserve the right to regulate those
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals by inspecting them
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
and responding to complaints etc etc
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
what recourse would you have if
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
something really went sideways if you
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't locate the owner or if the
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
owner was a corporate entity and wasn't
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
really a person at all
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
i've i've steered clear of the
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
i think there was an effort made
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
to give some towns
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's difficult i think our primary
 
04:01:46.150 --> 04:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility in government and in
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
local government is to maintain safety
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
for you know that's why we come together
 
04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
in in government that's why we choose
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
you know uh it's it's safety
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
among numbers and we realize that we're
 
04:01:58.150 --> 04:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're safer together
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
if there was not the ability to locate
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
the owner for any number
 
04:02:06.150 --> 04:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
of reasons and they're not just simply
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know noise violations and that's
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
a big part of you know as a mayor you
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
get a lot of complaints on a lot of
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
things but to the true health and safety
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
the way that is written uh in terms of
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
representatives not actually being
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know on site or anywhere or
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
designated there
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
that is an issue
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
um because i certainly wouldn't want you
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
know our chief of police to be put on
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
hold as they work through a management
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
company um that is dealing with you know
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 of these in portsmouth
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh seeing your list of mayors
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
in your opinion do these mayors know
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
what's best for their town
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
without you would have to ask that i
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
would say to uh to a mayor they all
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
believe so you'd have to ask their
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
voters um but i would agree that they um
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
as i do uh think that i
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
i know portsmouth and i would think that
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
mayor donchess would know nashua and and
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
mayor craig would know manchester um
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that it is a um
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think that the idea that this is a
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
problem that that needs solving on the
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
state level uh doesn't under uh that
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe um undermines
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that we try to do to
 
04:03:33.189 --> 04:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
bring people together in a community and
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
to promote that community
 
04:03:35.359 --> 04:03:36.830 align:start position:0%
to promote that community
so

04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up so do you feel that
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
your zoning and planning board can't
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
make these decisions
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
without without us
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that our zoning board uh and
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
planning board uh and city council can
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
make these decisions without
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire making them
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
for us thank you thank you
 
04:03:55.040 --> 04:03:57.030 align:start position:0%
for us thank you thank you

the purpose behind 249 and that there's
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
a role in our state's economy for
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals i'd like you to
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
consider carefully some of the points
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
that have been raised so far today i
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
know the changes made in the senate were
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
a big improvement to the bill
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
but i still think that after many years
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
of debating this issue on a statewide
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
basis we are still not quite there
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
my mayor from the city of portsmouth
 
04:06:00.389 --> 04:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
quite eloquently and powerfully made the
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
case on how short-term rentals
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
hurt long-term housing supply or have
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
the potential to do that and so
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
some models that we've seen work
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
successfully nationwide are to allow
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals for example through
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
permit conditional use permit or special
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
exception with a capped number of
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
permits allowed per municipality in this
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
way local control can allow for the
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
balance of long-term housing supply and
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
short-term housing supply
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
for those of you that don't know me i've
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
been a housing advocate for over a dozen
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
years now i've worked very closely on
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
this issue since 2008 or nine and so
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's something i'm intimately familiar
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
with and especially the role that zoning
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
has in our housing supply and so
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
if you do decide to move forward with
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
this bill i'd like to raise a couple
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
points that i think will be important
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
for you to incorporate
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
one is really to think about inc
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
including a provision on owner occupancy
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think that if we had um
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
language in this bill which allowed us
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
to address homes that were
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
only homes that were occupied by the
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
owner at least for 180 days a year
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
then the bill would be silent on these
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
corporate landlords who
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
are really the concern
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
we do want to let our homeowners in new
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire have control over their
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
private property property but we also
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
need to allow municipalities to balance
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
those rights
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
with other policy concerns which we let
 
04:07:32.550 --> 04:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
them do on a regular basis
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
i also think
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
if the bill were silent on these
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
corporate landlords that would allow us
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
as a state and as a civic body to make
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
sure we're maintaining
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
um homeowners who are present in our
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
town they're part of our civic life
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
they're our neighbors they run for
 
04:07:47.840 --> 04:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
they're our neighbors they run for
office

04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure that this
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a governance issue
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
on top of everything
 
04:07:54.000 --> 04:07:55.750 align:start position:0%
on top of everything
secondly

04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to consider adding the
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
option into the bill of
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowing a municipality to require a
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit for this use
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with the new hampshire
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
association of realtors that this is a
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
residential use i think it's done for
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
compensation if you have high turnover
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
there can be
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
traffic there can be people in and out
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
it starts to act more and more like a
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
commercial activity and the reason that
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
we have zoning is to allow
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
place commercial activity in logical
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
places it's to allow us to have
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods it's allow to allow us to
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
plan and create cities that are livable
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
and pleasant and so
 
04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
um if you allowed in addition to the
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
current registration and certificate
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
that are in the bill
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
the ability for municipalities to
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
potentially also require a cup
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
they could set the parameters for those
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
to happen and
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
it would still make a policy statement
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we want to see short-term rentals
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
as a part of our economy in new
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire but and yet strike a balance
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
with our municipalities being able again
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
to balance that not only with nuisance
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
issues but also with long-term housing
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
supply and quality of life
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that nobody here intends
 
04:09:14.000 --> 04:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that nobody here intends
to

04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
run roughshod over the careful and
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
dynamic work that our towns and cities
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
have done to zone
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
zone all of our political subdivisions
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
and municipalities but
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
if we move forward with the bill as
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
written it does allow what is in my
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
opinion a quasi commercial used to move
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
into all of our single-family
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and i think that's a
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
discussion that's best had at the local
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
level so
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
i will wrap up my comments there and i'm
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative power
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question i'm
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
taking notes
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
and i missed your reference to a cup
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
could you explain that yes yes
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so much for the
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
question so a cup or conditional use
 
04:09:57.760 --> 04:09:58.710 align:start position:0%
question so a cup or conditional use
permit

04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
permit
 
04:09:58.720 --> 04:10:00.149 align:start position:0%
permit
would

04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
would be a tool that municipalities have
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
to essentially permit short-term rental
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
as a use and by
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
enabling that option in the legislation
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities commonly
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
can allow cups for certain uses in
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
certain zones for example so in a
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
downtown commercial
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
district you know short-term rentals
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
could be allowed by conditional use
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
permit whereas in other zones they could
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
potentially be excluded
 
04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
we greatly appreciate your ability to be
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
patient with us as our schedule drags on
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
here a little bit of course i appreciate
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
all you guys work and i actually will be
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
back later today to see you so
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
good luck until then thank you very much
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
having me here today and i will be as
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
brief as i can um first off this is a
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
happy day for me because representative
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
umberger and i are in complete agreement
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
um very happy about that
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
i am strongly opposed to this bill and
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
i'm strongly in support of short-term
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
rentals and let me explain that um i
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
come from a district where it gets i'm
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
in i represent jackson bartlett and
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
hart's location
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
our the mount washington valley gets
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
about 6 million visitors a year so
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are integral part of
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
they're a disruptive innovation that are
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
not going away and i think all of us up
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
in that area understand the values value
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
that these units bring to our community
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not here to say that short-term
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
rental should go away
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
the issue for me and the issue for most
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
of my constituents who i've heard who do
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
not support this bill is whether um is
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
whether the issue is who should have the
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
legal authority to regulate short-term
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
rentals and zoning laws in new hampshire
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
have gone back almost 100 years and they
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
have deleted the state has delegated
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
authority to the towns to make their own
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
decisions their own zoning con decisions
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
that are consistent with other states
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
04:12:11.680 --> 04:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
and

04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
and as we said previously
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
our valley and as the mayor said the
 
04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
seacoast are probably the two areas that
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
are most impacted by this and
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that most granite staters
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the residents of the town
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
should have the legal right to make
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
decisions about short-term rentals and
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
about how their communities are zoned
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
and regulated
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
um we believe that the state shouldn't
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
be telling municipalities whether or not
 
04:12:37.110 --> 04:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
there should be short-term rentals
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
those should be a decision left to those
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
who live in the communities to determine
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
the kind of communities and
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that they want to live in
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and the the mayor also alluded to uh
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-state invent investors and i want
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
to say this isn't a far-fetched idea
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
because if you look over in neighboring
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
vermont which has some similar dip
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
demographic it's a tourist area they are
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
being heavily um invaded by out-of-state
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
investor groups so
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a far-fetched
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
fetch neighborhood that's just going to
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
happen here and that you're going to
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
have neighborhoods controlled by
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state investor groups
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so i will just again i'll cut this
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
short because a lot's already been said
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but i'd say for those people in this
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
community in this hearing who value
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
freedom um i say let's let's keep our
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
communities free to like regulate their
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
own land and i'm hoping that you'll
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
either amend the bill or um study
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee either of the above so that we
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
can enable local citizens to retain the
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
right to create the kind of communities
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
that they wish them to be thank you i'll
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
take any questions i'm sorry thank you
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%

i am representative sue gotling from
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
sullivan district 2
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
the towns of sunapee and croydon
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i am also in my 11th year as a
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
member of the select board in sunapee
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the emergence of short-term rentals in
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
sunapee first came to my attention
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
when our police chief about two years
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
ago appeared in front of the select
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
board and said
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
sunapee we have a problem
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
he related then the increased calls he
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
was getting about parking problems and
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
arguments with our young staff who were
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
trying to manage the town beach and most
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
of these were coming from people who
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
were using short-term rentals and really
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
did not understand
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
some of their obligations
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
the chief had done his research and he
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
shocked all of us with the number of
 
04:15:16.149 --> 04:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals in our small town of
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
3 200 people which at that time was
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.520 --> 04:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
he

04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
he
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
centipede has always been generous to
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
our homeowners who want to rent and
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
we've granted those homeowners an extra
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
beach sticker and a transfer station
 
04:15:37.760 --> 04:15:39.429 align:start position:0%
beach sticker and a transfer station
sticker

04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
for their renters and usually those
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
renters in the past have been for two
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
weeks or for a month that is no longer
 
04:15:47.520 --> 04:15:49.429 align:start position:0%
weeks or for a month that is no longer
true

04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
our overloaded
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
art well the increasing number of
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
short-term rental properties plus the
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
fact that they are generally seriously
 
04:15:59.279 --> 04:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
fact that they are generally seriously
overloaded

04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
overloaded
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
is putting tremendous pressure on all
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
our town services
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
and just as the town began to address
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
the emerging issues sb 249 was
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
introduced and i would say stopped us in
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
our tracks
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
i will introduce my
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%

04:16:25.359 --> 04:16:26.830 align:start position:0%
wallace who will talk to you about those
issues

04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you i am carol wallace and
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
i am a new member of the select board in
 
04:16:33.520 --> 04:16:34.710 align:start position:0%
i am a new member of the select board in
sunapee

04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
sunapee
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
and most of what i have in my testimony
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
has already been said so i'm going to
 
04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
spare you all the redundancy of it thank
 
04:16:42.800 --> 04:16:43.429 align:start position:0%
spare you all the redundancy of it thank
you

04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:16:43.439 --> 04:16:44.309 align:start position:0%
you
yes

04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
what sue did neglect to mention about
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
our police chief was that he was
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
assaulted in his own driveway
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
by an
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
inebriated guest
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
of one of these short-term rentals in
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
our town
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
that certainly got
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the town
 
04:17:05.349 --> 04:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
put the town on notice
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
about the severity of the issue when
 
04:17:07.359 --> 04:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
about the severity of the issue when
uncontrolled

04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
you've heard that
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
large hotel chains are entering the
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
short-term rental market
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
again begging the question as to when
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
does a residential property become a
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
commercial property
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's a determination in my mind and in
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
the mind of the select board that
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
determination should be made at the
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
local level by zoning officials who live
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the town
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
and not by a one-size-fits-all approach
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
which would be legislated by this date
 
04:17:44.080 --> 04:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
which would be legislated by this date
um

04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
i'm looking through my redacted
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of public safety
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
measures such as occupancy
 
04:17:58.389 --> 04:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
limits and parking restrictions would
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
also be limited by this bill
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
in summary the residents of sunapee
 
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
deserve a safe
 
04:18:06.640 --> 04:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
deserve a safe
orderly

04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%

both of you you said your police chief
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
went out to
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
to address some issues were they local
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
land use issues were they what were they
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
local land use issues or ordinances that
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
adopted by the town or were they
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
other issues um
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
they were places where there were folks
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
who thought that they should be able to
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
get to the beach even though we might
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
have said that at that point it was
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
already at its maximum and they couldn't
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand and they argued a lot about
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
that and uh and then we had the infamous
 
04:19:13.120 --> 04:19:14.070 align:start position:0%
that and uh and then we had the infamous
uh

04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
incident of harvard sending up a busload
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
to a
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
short-term rental right near the harbor
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
and there were 30 of them in a place
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that had what
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
six bedrooms or something like that and
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
although they were not drinking and
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
carousing nevertheless young people
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to bed early
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
and so there was a great deal of uh
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
noise and uh conversation and they're in
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
a place where they're very very close to
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
many other residents and one of the
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
things you might address carol is
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we do have an ordinance
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
organization now
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
in centipede
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
which are people who are short-term
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
rentals and want to do it right
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:20:09.199 --> 04:20:10.309 align:start position:0%
and so
i'm

04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
very pleased with that and
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have any group that is saying
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
we can't have them
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
what we're worried about is the
 
04:20:20.000 --> 04:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
what we're worried about is the
proliferation

04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
proliferation
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
almost anywhere and particularly i would
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.110 --> 04:20:31.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
ladies for taking my question so is it
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
true that
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
a municipality could through zoning
 
04:20:42.399 --> 04:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
a municipality could through zoning
prohibit

04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
a commercial
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
entity or enterprise from
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing property and
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
using it as a short-term rental
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
well we we do have zones in in our town
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%

residential you know so
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%

04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
but these are not
 
04:21:09.040 --> 04:21:09.910 align:start position:0%
but these are not

the

04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%

i'm excited i'm the first one speaking
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
let me just say that the um short-term
 
04:21:53.189 --> 04:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
rentals have been part of our community
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
for forever in
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:21:56.880 --> 04:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
um

04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:58.399 --> 04:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
question that we have
 
04:22:01.279 --> 04:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
question that we have
is

04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
you know are they legal
 
04:22:07.110 --> 04:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the answer today is yes
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any town that says that
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
renting your house is illegal
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
on the question of conditional use
 
04:22:13.520 --> 04:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
on the question of conditional use
permits

04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
permits
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
um a conditional use permit it takes a
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
high standard and allows you to
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
do something it grants you a a lower uh
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
restrictive level
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh to to do something so take a
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood want to put a
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
gas station in it get a conditional
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
permit you're allowed to do something
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't normally be allowed
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
with a conditional use permit
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with a short-term
 
04:22:39.920 --> 04:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with a short-term
rental

04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
rental
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
i can let anybody i want use my house
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
today for a day for an hour it's legal
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
therefore how can you issue a
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit for something
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's currently legal in the vast
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
majority of towns in our state
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
the other problem with the conditional
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
use permit
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
is that it becomes grandfathered once a
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit is issued
 
04:23:05.110 --> 04:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
it runs with the land
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
you don't renew them every year
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise no one would build a gas
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
station in a residential neighborhood
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that they would have to renew
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
commercial versus uh residential
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
and it's easy to pull out the fact that
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
well someone's getting paid therefore
 
04:23:25.110 --> 04:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's commercial
 
04:23:25.120 --> 04:23:25.910 align:start position:0%
it's commercial
well

04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
i rent my houses seasonally i get paid
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
for those those don't become commercial
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
properties in a neighborhood
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
long-term rentals
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
receive compensation for renting their
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
residential properties that's not a
 
04:23:41.110 --> 04:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
commercial use under any
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
stretch of the law
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
and if i rent the house for a day
 
04:23:46.469 --> 04:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
and charge a hundred dollars does that
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
make it commercial
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
we have two core court cases one in
 
04:23:51.439 --> 04:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
we have two core court cases one in
portsmouth

04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
where in the 16 page
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
judge's statement at the end of the case
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
never mentioned the word commercial once
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
judge ignatius and ruling in
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
conway clearly stated
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is a residential use in a
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood
 
04:24:10.560 --> 04:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood
so

04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
i know people are grasping for straws to
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
say we need to ban them you know because
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know they're noisy and they're loud
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
and they park on the streets and
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
our association totally agrees regulate
 
04:24:23.279 --> 04:24:25.349 align:start position:0%
our association totally agrees regulate
them

04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
do whatever you would do with any other
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
house on the street that was not
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
performing properly causing problems
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
having fireworks having you know late
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
night parties
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
we have rules and regulations and that's
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
where local control comes in
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
sp 29 does not take away local control
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
in fact it grants the towns additional
 
04:24:45.760 --> 04:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
in fact it grants the towns additional
control

04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
that they currently don't have in rsas
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
the the right to register the property
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
the right to actually walk in and
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
inspect a property for health safety
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is banned
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire no one no fire chief
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
can knock on my door and inspect my
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
house for life safety issues
 
04:25:11.110 --> 04:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
um currently and we're granting that to
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so we're actually
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
giving towns more local control not
 
04:25:17.110 --> 04:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
taking anything away
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing that sb249 does
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
is it says just like we did with
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
ancillary dwelling units you can't ban
 
04:25:24.960 --> 04:25:26.469 align:start position:0%
ancillary dwelling units you can't ban
them

04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
you can regulate the hell out of them
 
04:25:30.070 --> 04:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
you can't ban them
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
um so i i just think that people need to
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know slow down look at what the law
 
04:25:35.840 --> 04:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
you know slow down look at what the law
says

04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
and look about personal property rights
 
04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
on the final issue
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
some of the addendums and
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry amendments that are being put
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
forth and
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the the wish lists added to this
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill they're all interesting they're
 
04:25:52.560 --> 04:25:54.229 align:start position:0%
bill they're all interesting they're
great

04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
but out of one side of the conversation
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
we hear we want local control we don't
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
want the state telling us what to do
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
and then on the other side of the table
 
04:26:05.110 --> 04:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
people are adding on pages and pages and
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
pages of
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
regulations and controls
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
that the towns are going to have to deal
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
with that are going to come from the
 
04:26:11.040 --> 04:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
with that are going to come from the
state

04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think the beauty of french's bill was
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
he kept it clean he just said you can't
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
ban them
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever else you want with
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
them but just like ancillary dwelling
 
04:26:21.520 --> 04:26:22.550 align:start position:0%
them but just like ancillary dwelling
units

04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
units
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
you can't ban them they're part of our
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
community they're part of our
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods they're part of new
 
04:26:26.640 --> 04:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods they're part of new
hampshire

04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say thank you
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your patience representative
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair and thank you for
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
one of the concepts that i'm kind of
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
grappling with with all this testimony
 
04:26:51.199 --> 04:26:52.070 align:start position:0%
grappling with with all this testimony
is

04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
um short-term rentals
 
04:26:54.479 --> 04:26:55.269 align:start position:0%
um short-term rentals
um

04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're rented let's say by the owner
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
and let's just say it's a homeowner
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
let's say it's you
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
but the intent is that they're rented
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
for occupancy not to be a home for
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
someone where a long-term rental is
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
someone's home
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
so do you see that a community should
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
have the interest in
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
helping to craft their community
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
and delineate between a home and an
 
04:27:20.560 --> 04:27:23.349 align:start position:0%
and delineate between a home and an
occupancy

04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question but every
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
seasonal rentals month-to-month rentals
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
j-2 and j-1 visa rentals were a huge
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
part of the new hampshire economy just a
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
few years ago prior to covet yet
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
nobody's screaming we don't want
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
temporary workers to come to new
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and live in these houses on my
 
04:27:44.960 --> 04:27:45.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire and live in these houses on my
street

04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
street
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not full-time residents
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
i think one of the beauties of america
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
um so along those lines do you see
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's also a difference between
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
somebody a short-term rental let's say
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
of a few days or a week and a short-term
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
rental of six months
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's a
 
04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
place for both of them in our economy
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
obviously short-term rentals are very
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
positive or
 
04:28:14.960 --> 04:28:16.790 align:start position:0%
positive or
popular

04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
popular
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
way to vacation nowadays
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned when people talk
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
about owner occupancy
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
and vacation rentals
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
like you know you take a three-bedroom
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
house on a side street that i own
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
and a family wants to come up and go to
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
story land i don't think they want me
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
one more mr chair
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
well i think with owner occupancy would
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
would you say that it could be
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted that the owner would occupy
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
that building at some time during a year
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
not simultaneously with the person
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
renting it
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
that is a that's a that's a
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
comment that has not gotten a clear
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
answer yet um i obviously think nobody
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
wants me sleeping in that extra bedroom
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
but the the nuance of it that needs to
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
be thought of is if anyone in this room
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
had a house in bartlett where i live a
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
ski house or a hiking place
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
are you really going to spend 186 nights
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
a year up there
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
when you have a full-time job
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
in another town
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
those those are vacation homes you spend
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
weekend here a week there whatever and
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to set a standard that the
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
owner has to live in at 180 days is that
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
realistic and how would you even track
 
04:29:34.159 --> 04:29:36.070 align:start position:0%
realistic and how would you even track
that

04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think you stated in your testimony
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
that short-term rentals are legal all
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
over the state is that correct
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
then why do you need a law
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
we we don't what the reason that um well
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
it brings up a very good point obviously
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
there i live in the white mountains and
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
four towns currently
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
with either
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
severe restrictions on the planning
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
severe restrictions on short-term
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
rentals or an outright ban on short-term
 
04:30:10.960 --> 04:30:12.790 align:start position:0%
rentals or an outright ban on short-term
rentals

04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
our association is part of the lawsuit
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
that went towards uh to uh in conway and
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
we were able to knock that down it's now
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
at uh superior court
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
um and we hope to win there
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
um in madison they had a petition
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
warrant article to totally ban them in
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
the town of edelweiss
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
we intervened there and the town agreed
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
to rescind the cease and desist orders
 
04:30:37.520 --> 04:30:38.389 align:start position:0%
to rescind the cease and desist orders
there

04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
freedom just voted to
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
restrict them to 90 days per year
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
obviously a question of illegal taking
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
without compensation on the 5th
 
04:30:48.239 --> 04:30:50.070 align:start position:0%
without compensation on the 5th
amendment

04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
you can't just take my property and tell
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
me i can only use it for 90 days a year
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
so those are the kind of issues that we
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
think 249 is going to solve and i think
 
04:31:01.269 --> 04:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
one important thing that the legislative
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
branch needs to look at is if you don't
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
deal with short-term rentals with a bill
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
like sb 29 that empowers towns to
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
regulate them you're leaving it up to
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
a dozen
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
superior court judges to make a decision
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
you guys lose the ability to legislate
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up mr chair well towns
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
and cities already have the ability to
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
regulate for all kinds of issues what
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
what is this bill giving us again it
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
gives you the right to insist we don't
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
already have you do not have the right
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
to come into my house and inspect it for
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
you would have if it was a short-term
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
rental in the town of bartlett
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
if sd29 passes
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have a right to regulate my
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
house and ask me who to contact in case
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
of emergency with sb229
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
you would have that right and you would
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
be compensated i would have to pay you
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
to register my own house as a short-term
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
rental which allows you to have the
 
04:32:00.159 --> 04:32:01.030 align:start position:0%
rental which allows you to have the
staff

04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
at the town level to regulate
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative matt jury
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question i first want to say
 
04:32:09.990 --> 04:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
that i own
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
i have properties that i rent out and i
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
do use
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
airbnb and others quite often when we
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
travel so i'm a supporter i'm just also
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
a big supporter of local control and
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
that and the responsibilities that
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
planning boards and select boards have
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and my my question goes directly to what
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative stavis was just saying
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
what the bill says is that a town may
 
04:32:32.159 --> 04:32:33.429 align:start position:0%
what the bill says is that a town may
may

04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:32:33.439 --> 04:32:34.630 align:start position:0%
may
require

04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
that you meet the minimum housing
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
standards under rsa 4810
 
04:32:38.880 --> 04:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
standards under rsa 4810
or

04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
the standards for carbon monoxide and
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
alarms under 153 correct may correct if
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
you do not what am i inspecting
 
04:32:50.479 --> 04:32:51.670 align:start position:0%
you do not what am i inspecting
what

04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
everyone screams local control that's
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
your local control if you want to do
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
those things you may
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we're not telling sb you know senator
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
french isn't saying every town in new
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire needs to inspect every
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
short-term rental for uh
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know carbon monoxide monitors some
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
small towns might not have the staff to
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
do that i mean it might be a major issue
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to go in and inspect
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
towns again the the the beauty of sv 29
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
is it gives towns the local control they
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
may do
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
what they need to do
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
everyone asked for the right to inspect
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
and we gave it to them but we're not
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
forcing anybody to do anything
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh you have a follow-up no
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
i was scanning through the bill once
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
again and uh
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
a question that had been asked
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
previously by representative power
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh said the i believe this uh
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
senator french said oh somebody else
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
will answer that so
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
on line nine of the first page it that
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
talks about the building or structure is
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
conforming or non-conforming do you know
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert on on that
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
statement i believe that was pulled out
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
of existing legislation
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
and i believe conforming and
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
non-conforming would be based on the
 
04:34:28.230 --> 04:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
fact of if i had a 1820s
 
04:34:28.240 --> 04:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
fact of if i had a 1820s
farmhouse

04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
farmhouse
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
it would no longer be conforming to
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
current code
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
but since it's a residential property
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
currently even though it's
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
non-conforming i could use that property
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
as a short-term rental and that's simply
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
a guess from 25 years in real estate and
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
zoning well it's a much better guess
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
than i have thank you
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%

04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%

question i missed your name could you
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%

what i was going to talk about
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%

or against strs the us in them but that
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
the sp
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
sp 249 is essentially a statewide um
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
kind of takeover of local zoning laws
 
04:36:31.680 --> 04:36:32.949 align:start position:0%
kind of takeover of local zoning laws
which

04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
is believed to resolve the issue
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the sb-249 being promoted does not
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
take an account it would not allow local
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
officials to consider the character of
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
the districts
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
several towns are charming each of the
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
221 towns and 13 cities have different
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
historical districts environmental
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
and established neighborhoods
 
04:36:58.949 --> 04:36:58.959 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
i looked up and found online american
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
strategies this was a 2019
 
04:37:04.480 --> 04:37:05.910 align:start position:0%
strategies this was a 2019
survey

04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that took vote in new hampshire people
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
the voters as i stated as it says voters
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
feel cities and
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
counties know best when it comes to
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
creating rental rules and regulations
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
for their own communities 41 percent
 
04:37:23.189 --> 04:37:23.199 align:start position:0%

04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're also considered by
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the argument that local governments
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
already have the tools to protect public
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
safety and deal with bad behavior
 
04:37:32.959 --> 04:37:34.230 align:start position:0%
safety and deal with bad behavior
um

04:37:34.230 --> 04:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
a lot's been talked about so i'll tell
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
you about um from madison we dealt with
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
it it's been mentioned before
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
not the whole story from paul from meyer
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
we had in madison a lot of debate about
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
the sb 249 i mean strs and renting on
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
one side we had article 4 which
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
essentially what sp249 is
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
you can rent anywhere you can have up to
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
16 people in any zone
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
on the other side we had article eight
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
this was
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
what it said is just long term no short
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
term renting in residential areas
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
two opposing bills sb249 what happened
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
the voters voted both down
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
they didn't agree with the total on
 
04:38:20.799 --> 04:38:22.150 align:start position:0%
they didn't agree with the total on
uncontrolled

04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
s you know rentals and the other one
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't believe that we should ban
 
04:38:25.359 --> 04:38:26.629 align:start position:0%
they didn't believe that we should ban
them

04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
what do we do now
 
04:38:28.480 --> 04:38:29.590 align:start position:0%
what do we do now
well

04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
we all had a meeting and what we're
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
like local uh countries local ordinance
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
we have another meeting we start again
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
what we've done too is um it's been
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we're going to have
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
potentially form a subcommittee that'll
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
include not only residents but actually
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
out of town owners trying to get
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
everyone together
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about it they have every meeting
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
set up we'll be talking about strs
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to handle it
 
04:39:01.349 --> 04:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
also in june they set up a six o'clock
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
meeting they're going to have actually
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
six hours they hope it's done by 12
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock to talk about all these issues
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we see here
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
during this
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
year before the voting for these two
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
articles we had more people in our one
 
04:39:15.680 --> 04:39:16.551 align:start position:0%
articles we had more people in our one
town

04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
talking about it than you have here
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the whole state this is
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
just one town the towns need to hear
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
what the local people are talking about
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
they need to hear what the local
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
problems are
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who can handle it
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
what's beauty of that is as a
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
person and as a people there these town
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
officials are the referees
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
these town officials
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
are the therapists for these people
 
04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing that this has
 
04:39:46.788 --> 04:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
happened this year we have more people
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
who went to vote in madison
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
almost as much as the highest number of
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
voters that they ever had
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
so what's it doing it's causing
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
communities to work together
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the end we're all working together
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're fighting we're arguing we're
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
debating we're laughing
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
we had been people held up signs we we
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
talked to each other we're talking about
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the issues we're getting together we
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
will handle it if we don't hang out this
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
year what happens
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
next year we try again these issues can
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
be resolved on a local level and i do
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
not think it should be handled on the
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
state level for
 
04:40:23.600 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
state level for
zoning

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's what i have thank you for your
 
04:40:27.280 --> 04:40:30.230 align:start position:0%

please be brief
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%

i actually have a cleaning service and i
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
clean for airbnbs
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
bvr vrbos whatever you want to call them
 
04:41:06.798 --> 04:41:08.470 align:start position:0%
bvr vrbos whatever you want to call them
and

04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%

keep short-term rentals around in new
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to help my business
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
because it's based
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
on short-term rentals
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't get as many
 
04:41:23.600 --> 04:41:24.868 align:start position:0%
i don't get as many
small

04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
some people want once a month
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's not going to pay the bills
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
i need something that's going to be
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
a flip so i can make as much money as i
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
can to pay my bills and without this i
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to buy my house
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:41:41.840 --> 04:41:43.350 align:start position:0%
last year
so

04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little further away than i wanted
 
04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
but i still work in
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
north conway bartlett
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.160 --> 04:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you for coming
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this what i
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
hope is an easy question are most houses
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
well cared for by the people who come
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
into rent or
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
i've had some issues
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
usually when i
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
tell the owner they take care of that
 
04:42:16.958 --> 04:42:20.230 align:start position:0%
tell the owner they take care of that
and

04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'll use this for an example okay so i
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
had a rental that i was uh due to clean
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
but um airbnb actually stopped it
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
because they will ban
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
people that destroyed people's property
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
um or does something he's got a lifetime
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
ban he can never rent again so she had
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%

04:42:42.480 --> 04:42:45.030 align:start position:0%

04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
they do take care of
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%

property
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
back as far as 2018 i realized that
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
a growing part of our communities
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
at the time i felt like well if you
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
can't beat them join them
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i also got listed on airbnb and vrbo
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to clarify for everyone here
 
04:44:22.798 --> 04:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to clarify for everyone here
that

04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
vrbo and airbnb are not properties they
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
are software platforms that allow
 
04:44:31.920 --> 04:44:33.270 align:start position:0%
are software platforms that allow
homeowners

04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
or property owners
 
04:44:35.120 --> 04:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
or property owners
to

04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
list their properties
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
they do offer significant insurance
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
programs as an incentive
 
04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
and when we use the term airbnb it is
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
the software platform it is not a
 
04:44:50.958 --> 04:44:53.350 align:start position:0%
the software platform it is not a
property

04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
the term airbnb
 
04:44:55.920 --> 04:44:57.590 align:start position:0%
the term airbnb
uses

04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
uses
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
the letters b and b in their corporate
 
04:45:00.718 --> 04:45:01.830 align:start position:0%
the letters b and b in their corporate
name

04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
name
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
they are not necessarily bed and
 
04:45:04.560 --> 04:45:07.110 align:start position:0%
they are not necessarily bed and
breakfasts

04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
breakfasts
 
04:45:07.120 --> 04:45:08.310 align:start position:0%
breakfasts
so

04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:11.830 --> 04:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
most properties short-term rentals
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
they allow the use of a kitchen
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and they are for vacationers staying
 
04:45:18.080 --> 04:45:18.870 align:start position:0%
and they are for vacationers staying
short-term

04:45:18.870 --> 04:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
04:45:18.880 --> 04:45:20.628 align:start position:0%
short-term
[Music]

04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
they do not provide breakfast like a bed
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
and breakfast does
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to clarify that because i
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
hear these terms used all the time and
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
90 of the time they're misused
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i have only 10 copies of some
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
testimony which i will
 
04:45:43.510 --> 04:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
get distributed somehow here
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to read it
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to save time and i'm going to
 
04:45:52.090 --> 04:45:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.100 --> 04:46:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.000 --> 04:46:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
and i also brought my business cards to
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie will take them
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.520 --> 04:46:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
so as i have described my role i am very
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
much in the trenches of this short-term
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
rental situation
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
i'm on both sides of the fence
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it impacts not only my business my
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
livelihood my neighbors my community
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
which i cherish very much
 
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:11.590 align:start position:0%
which i cherish very much
so

04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:11.600 --> 04:47:12.628 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
from this perspective
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
um i am
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
advently against this bill
 
04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
as it started out as banning short-term
 
04:47:24.560 --> 04:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
as it started out as banning short-term
rentals

04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
04:47:29.110 --> 04:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
or not banning short-term rentals i'm
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
totally against that
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
now this bill has been sugar coated with
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of amendment changes variations
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
but we're still not there yet it is a
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
very complex issue and it's not limited
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
to just new hampshire the whole world
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
that books through these online vacation
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
rental platforms
 
04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
is coping with the same issues
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
all over the world
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
in every language
 
04:47:59.440 --> 04:48:00.788 align:start position:0%
in every language
so

04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
the complicated related issues do need
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be further studied
 
04:48:08.550 --> 04:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman before me had proposed
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
that there be further
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
meetings discussions with all parties
 
04:48:12.958 --> 04:48:14.550 align:start position:0%
meetings discussions with all parties
represented

04:48:14.550 --> 04:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
represented
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
i think is the way to go
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot pass this bill as it is
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
currently stated it is going to open up
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
a can of worms for more problems than it
 
04:48:26.718 --> 04:48:28.708 align:start position:0%
a can of worms for more problems than it
solves

04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
solves
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we do end up with though
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
has to
 
04:48:33.520 --> 04:48:34.390 align:start position:0%
has to
cover

04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
the following five items
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
registration has to happen
 
04:48:42.550 --> 04:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
even as a b b owner i would like to
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
refer guests that i can't accommodate
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
myself because i'm fully booked i'd like
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
to refer them to other places
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
especially with all the weddings that
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
castle in the clouds
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
i can't book any more than i already
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
have i don't know where to send them
 
04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
there are no other accommodations
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
between my place and castle in the
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
clouds for example
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
all i can do is refer them to short-term
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
rentals well guess what i have no idea
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
where they are who they are
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
how many people they can accommodate
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
and so towns need to have registrations
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
they need to know who the short-term
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
rental owners are where they are
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
and how many people they can accommodate
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'd love to have access to that
 
04:49:28.080 --> 04:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
i'd love to have access to that
information

04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
safety and parking in the four plus
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
years that i've been
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
neighbors to short-term rentals and
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
owning properties that i rent out myself
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
i have to deal with
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%

to
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
the residence of my own sister because
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
the neighbor's property has
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%

my sister almost died
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
fortunately i was able to run up to my
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
sister's house and save her life before
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
the ambulance and the medics could get
 
04:50:17.600 --> 04:50:19.110 align:start position:0%
the ambulance and the medics could get
there

04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is reality of what i've had to deal
 
04:50:21.760 --> 04:50:22.948 align:start position:0%
this is reality of what i've had to deal
with

04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
we've had fireworks go off four o'clock
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
monday morning
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
the town in dated with phone calls about
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
what happened with these fireworks going
 
04:50:32.958 --> 04:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
what happened with these fireworks going
off

04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
at an ungodly hour
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
some people thought there was a crash
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
some people thought a bomb went off some
 
04:50:42.150 --> 04:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
of my neighbors thought that
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
we were under attack
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody had a heart attack because they
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
were so shocked by the loud boom of the
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
fireworks at that hour
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
children were late to school because
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
their night was disrupted and so forth
 
04:50:58.830 --> 04:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
other problems include
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
parking sewer sewer overflow
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
because there's too many people
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
in a house that was supposed to only
 
04:51:07.760 --> 04:51:09.430 align:start position:0%
in a house that was supposed to only
accommodate

04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
on and on it goes
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the safety and the parking and yes
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
authorities in town should be able to
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
conduct an inspection just like bed and
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
breakfast is i think part of whatever
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
future law we end up with to take a page
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
out of what bed and breakfasts have to
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
qualify for we are inspected we follow
 
04:51:37.350 --> 04:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
fire codes
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have to have carbon monoxide
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
detectors smoke detectors we need to
 
04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
have fire extinguishers we need to have
 
04:51:46.560 --> 04:51:47.350 align:start position:0%
have fire extinguishers we need to have
two

04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
forms of egress from every floor of our
 
04:51:51.200 --> 04:51:52.550 align:start position:0%
forms of egress from every floor of our
properties

04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
properties
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.750 --> 04:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
some b and b are some vacation rentals
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
do offer breakfast or other meals well
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
why would they be able to offer meals
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
where b and b's have to have a food
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
service license
 
04:52:20.788 --> 04:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
so this is another aspect that has not
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
been discussed before but if meals are
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
being offered
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
water temperature water well testing
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
dishwasher temperature refrigerator
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
temperatures ovens and stoves all need
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
to be inspected in order to get a food
 
04:52:35.360 --> 04:52:37.750 align:start position:0%
to be inspected in order to get a food
license

04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
noise and events has been discussed
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
before so i'm not going to
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate that
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
community housing needs have also been
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier today
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
but another aspect is the impact of so
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
many vacation rentals on the existing
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
accommodations that our communities have
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
personally i'm very much in favor of
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
every type of accommodation being
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
available to visitors and residents of
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but there has to be a
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
balance right now the bmb
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
community is suffering from the vacation
 
04:53:12.000 --> 04:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
community is suffering from the vacation
rental

04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
rental
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
properties popping up all over the place
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
and i am particularly worried about the
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
most recent acquisition where bayside
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
rentals in meredith is now owned and
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
controlled by marriott homes
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
so that means
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
that the large corporations the big
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
hotels can come in and operate through a
 
04:53:40.390 --> 04:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
third party and take over neighborhoods
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is not okay
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
this cannot happen in new hampshire
 
04:53:46.840 --> 04:53:48.550 align:start position:0%
this cannot happen in new hampshire
now

04:53:48.550 --> 04:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure my five minutes is up however
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
there is another speaker
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
um who
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
was not able to stay because of the
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
schedule change
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
so i am now representing heidi mildred
 
04:54:03.440 --> 04:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
so i am now representing heidi mildred
millbread

04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
millbread
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
she is currently owner of a b b in
 
04:54:07.520 --> 04:54:09.270 align:start position:0%
she is currently owner of a b b in
bristol

04:54:09.270 --> 04:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
bristol
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
she's president of the new hampshire
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
statewide b b association
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
and she also sits on the board of the
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lodging and restaurant
 
04:54:18.160 --> 04:54:19.990 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lodging and restaurant
association

04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
she asked me to read her statement which
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
will only take a few minutes
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
in keeping has been around since before
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
jesus birth
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
we innkeepers have a long and storied
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
history but thanks to a few senators
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
they want to see our livelihood pushed
 
04:54:38.788 --> 04:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
to the side
 
04:54:38.798 --> 04:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
to the side
so

04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
much of new hampshire being a great
 
04:54:44.550 --> 04:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
place to run a small business it seems
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
not to be the case
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
sb 249 says that anyone with a single or
 
04:54:52.150 --> 04:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
double family home may rent it out for
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
money with no regulations license or
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement sure the bill includes
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
language that towns may
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
adopt an ordinance require owner
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
residency who wishes to utilize the
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
property for
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
vacation rental
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
and to file registrations with the town
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
the town or municipality may adopt an
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
orient an ordinance which
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
inspection of property is determined if
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
the property meets the minimum housing
 
04:55:21.760 --> 04:55:22.868 align:start position:0%
the property meets the minimum housing
standards

04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
the town or municipality may enforce and
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
regulate and may collect a fee for
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
enforcing this
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
the municipality may establish a
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee to cover the cost to the
 
04:55:34.798 --> 04:55:36.310 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee to cover the cost to the
town

04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:55:38.550 --> 04:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
but it's doubtful that all communities
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
can actually be able to do this
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
many small towns make up tourist areas
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the whole state is a tourist area
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
can we really believe that small towns
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to come up with the
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
money so that they can hire somebody to
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
enforce zonings and codes over and above
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
what they're already doing
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
a person that lists their house for rent
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
does not even need to be on site
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
they can be in another town state or
 
04:56:06.480 --> 04:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
they can be in another town state or
country

we need to register the name with the

rental tax with a tax license number we
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
need to have our kitchens inspected and
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
licensed on a side note many airbnbs
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
vrbo short-term rentals are serving food
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
and it's just not regulated
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
we need to carry commercial insurance
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
rumor has it that airbnb offers hosts

04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be hardwired to the fire
 
04:57:40.550 --> 04:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
departments we have alarm systems we
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
have sprinkler systems these are all
 
04:57:42.560 --> 04:57:44.390 align:start position:0%
have sprinkler systems these are all
required

04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%

04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
some b and b's have to get their boilers
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
inspected as well
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passes rsa 175.1
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
becomes obsolete i simply i will simply
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
stop paying for all fees license taxes
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
and become a short-term rental
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
04:58:03.440 --> 04:58:04.470 align:start position:0%
under this law
and

04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm out of the b and b business
 
04:58:09.030 --> 04:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
so it will impact
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
an industry that's been here in new
 
04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a very long time is very
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
much part of our culture
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
sb 249 is cloaked as allowing a person
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
with a second home to rent it for a week
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
or two to help pay their property taxes
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
if passed the bill is going to be a
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
nightmare for towns and neighborhoods
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
anybody could buy up property anywhere
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
and turn them into short-term rentals
 
04:58:36.718 --> 04:58:38.550 align:start position:0%
and turn them into short-term rentals
and

04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
the towns really can't do anything about
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
it unless they violate
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
potential registrations inspections
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
and ordinances
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would give me an absolute
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
right to rent my three bedroom house to
 
04:58:57.030 --> 04:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
twenty thirty 100 people unless it's
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
regulated or worse every affordable
 
04:58:59.840 --> 04:59:02.708 align:start position:0%
regulated or worse every affordable
house

04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm on the last sentence i promise my
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
colleague who has attended many of these
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
meetings that i would read this
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
or worse every affordable house that a
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
working family might purchase will be
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
bought and turned into short-term
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
rentals by a group with a pool of cash
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
sort of makes you wonder what kind of
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
so i reiterate the example of the
 
04:59:31.120 --> 04:59:32.310 align:start position:0%
so i reiterate the example of the
marriott

04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
marriott
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
now owning bayside rentals
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
and buying up properties in the lakes
 
04:59:37.360 --> 04:59:39.510 align:start position:0%
and buying up properties in the lakes
region

04:59:39.510 --> 04:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
region
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it's all business it's all money
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
making nothing to do with the
 
04:59:43.200 --> 04:59:47.350 align:start position:0%
making nothing to do with the
communities

04:59:47.350 --> 04:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i have a process

05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
if i say that right yes you did it
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
i have coffees here sure
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:01:14.550 --> 05:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
i have my phone here that has a
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
three-minute timer perfect
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
so if you bear with me for three minutes
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
i have a statement to read
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
my name is bill dempster i am from
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
madison new hampshire
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of testimony here but
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to reiterate some points
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i bring up some new points for you
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
airbnb and vrbo are two multinational
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
corporations they brought short-term
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
rentals to the mainstream america making
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
it easier to invest in transient
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
vacation rentals
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
according to industry
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
statistics the average annual
 
05:01:49.110 --> 05:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
revenue for an str unit located in
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's a significant amount of money
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
that would certainly help explain the 16
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
conversion rate of recently sold
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
single-family residential homes that
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
were not strs that went over to str's
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is over a 14-month period starting
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
in january of 2021.
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
interestingly the greatest fear of
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
owners operators investors and realtors
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
driving this multi-billion dollar
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
short-term rental industry is not
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
parking tickets it's not registration
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
fees not misdemeanor fines or even
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
property inspections
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
these are simply considered the cost of
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
doing business
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
according to the 500 discussion boards
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i went and reviewed in many str
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
forums such as airbnb community bigger
 
05:02:39.670 --> 05:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
pockets and tripadvisor
 
05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%

um

05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
i had a two-page
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony but i think i'll boil
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
it down to a couple of points
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
i've read sb 249 numerous times i
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
watched the whole four-hour senate
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and for clarification when they
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the rights that they're
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
giving to the towns to regulate
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals one of them is to
 
05:04:49.270 --> 05:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
allow the towns to have a contact
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
the contact is only for legal service
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a contact where you can call up
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
the phone and say hey look dude there's
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
15 guys at your house throwing beer
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
bottles out the window so that contact
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
person is not allowed under sb 249 the
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
inspection that they so graciously allow
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
the towns to do is only the initial
 
05:05:12.550 --> 05:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
inspection when they register if a year
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
down the road the house's decks are
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
falling off and windows are broken you
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
have to take the owner to court in order
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do an inspection unless they agree to
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
do the inspection so those two things
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
advantages that they give to the
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities but they're very limited
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem with sp 249 and with
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals is occupancy the
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
problem is that it does not allow you to
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
limit the occupancy
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
in a home the the the stories that we
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
heard from sunapee where there's 35
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
students singing a seven bedroom house
 
05:05:49.600 --> 05:05:50.550 align:start position:0%
students singing a seven bedroom house
um

05:05:50.550 --> 05:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have a thread three bedroom home up
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
in our neighborhood that advertises for
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
16 occupants without the town's ability
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
to limit occupancy that's where all the
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
other problems stem from is is over
 
05:06:01.920 --> 05:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
other problems stem from is is over
occupancy

05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
occupancy
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
commercial use versus residential use
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion about that
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone came up with a great analogy and
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
i believe it was margaret so i might uh
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
step on her her story here a little bit
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
but as a quick example when you invite
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
six people to your house and you serve
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
them dinner and wine and dessert that's
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
a residential use when you advertise in
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
the paper that you're going to be
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
charging them for those meals to come to
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
your home and you bill them per person
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
for those meals it is now a restaurant
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
that is how an str is equated you're
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
charging a per night rate to come and
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
sleep in your home you are now creating
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
a business
 
05:06:45.280 --> 05:06:46.310 align:start position:0%
a business
um

05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
the average str in north conway 39
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
500 is the average amount of money that
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
those str's take in
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
what retail worker restaurant worker or
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
teacher could ever afford 39 000 a year
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
in rent that's why the conversion from a
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
home that was residential and
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
potentially rented to a short-term
 
05:07:06.638 --> 05:07:08.310 align:start position:0%
potentially rented to a short-term
rental

05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
rental
 
05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
the commercialization of short-term
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
rentals there is a company it's called
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
re-alpha so just like alpha male
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
re-alpha they're a
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
public company they're amassing money
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
and they have a plan
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
they're already in the process of
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
purchasing 15 000 short-term rentals
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're starting in dallas they're going
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
to miami they're going to chicago then i
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
believe they're going to colorado so our
 
05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
little town in new hampshire will have a
 
05:07:40.150 --> 05:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
target on its back in no time so if we
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
don't put local regulations in place to
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
control that we're just rolling out the
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
red carpet and trying to deal with
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
something five years down the road that
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
the town should have dealt with
 
05:07:50.638 --> 05:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
the town should have dealt with
currently

05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%

allowing me to speak
 
05:08:22.000 --> 05:08:24.310 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
today

05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the stuff that everyone's been
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
is most of the things that i had already
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
thought you know was in my
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
rep what i wanted to put ahead
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to say some of the things
 
05:08:42.000 --> 05:08:42.788 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to say some of the things
to

05:08:42.788 --> 05:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
get the points across of what
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
i feel is
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
hurting and why this bill should not be
 
05:08:49.360 --> 05:08:51.510 align:start position:0%
hurting and why this bill should not be
passed

05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
passed
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
the towns that have the
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
towns that are having this issue with
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the boom of short-term rentals have been
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
regulated them using the existing
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances and master plan guidelines as
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
we all know each town has zoning
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances in place for a reason
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
a century ago the u.s supreme court
 
05:09:12.320 --> 05:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
a century ago the u.s supreme court
ruled

05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
ruled
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of zoning
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
in it stands today
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
that alone is the reason not to put this
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill through
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
the boom going on with str's and
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
vacation areas are taking away the
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of renting and purchasing
 
05:09:33.270 --> 05:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
a home
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
the mount washington valley
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
area businesses
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
have been reducing hours of operation
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
and closing midweek due to lack of
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
workers caused by the lack of affordable
 
05:09:49.440 --> 05:09:50.948 align:start position:0%
workers caused by the lack of affordable
housing

05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:09:54.550 --> 05:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
63 percent of identified str owners do
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
not reside in our town
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
or our state
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
don't be fooled by the millions of
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollars they will be telling you
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
most of the lodging income already
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
leaves the state
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
the entire process of pushing the senate
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill was most disturbing some of these
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
senators are involved in real estate
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
businesses and it seems that they are
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
the extension of the new hampshire board
 
05:10:22.628 --> 05:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
of realtors on top of that
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
the final vote was done by roll call
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
this way the public would not know how
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the senators voted
 
05:10:29.760 --> 05:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
the senators voted
one

05:10:30.550 --> 05:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:10:32.470 --> 05:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
last summer my wife asked me to go down
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
to the garden i walked down
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
opened my door
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and right in front of me
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
was a complete stranger in my backyard
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
i asked him what's he doing here
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
he said i'm just taking pictures
 
05:10:51.200 --> 05:10:52.708 align:start position:0%
he said i'm just taking pictures
then

05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
i said where where you from he says well
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm renting the house across the street
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
only for a couple of days
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
i said this is private property you need
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
at that moment i paused for a second and
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
i thought about
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
what would have been
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
if my
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
young granddaughter was sent down by my
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
how do you think that made me feel how
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
this bill will take away the housing it
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
will take away the ability for their
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
towns to control their own environment
 
05:11:34.868 --> 05:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
and on top of that it'll take the
 
05:11:34.878 --> 05:11:36.230 align:start position:0%
and on top of that it'll take the
availability

05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
availability
 
05:11:38.230 --> 05:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
of making me feel safe
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
and comfortable in my own backyard what
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
about my
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
property rights this bill should not be
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
passed the way it is right now
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%

making your comments brief

we're in a little bit of a schedule snag
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay so my name is bob quinn i'm the ceo
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire association of
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
realtors thank you for uh
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
listening to us this afternoon excuse me
 
05:13:15.520 --> 05:13:17.190 align:start position:0%
listening to us this afternoon excuse me
so

05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
rsa the first part of the bill deals
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
with rsa 674 so that's the power
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
that has been granted to municipalities
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
for zoning
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
we think of zoning most of the time you
 
05:13:29.350 --> 05:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
think of the use of a property or
 
05:13:29.360 --> 05:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
think of the use of a property or
structure

05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
structure
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
so if
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
a someone wants to put a restaurant or a
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
barber shop
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
into a residential neighborhood
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the municipalities have complete
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
authority to dictate that that's not
 
05:13:42.080 --> 05:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
authority to dictate that that's not
permissible

05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's a commercial activity and they are
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
clearly given regulatory authority to
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit or ban those
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
so when we come to short-term rentals
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll use um justice ignatius
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
comments in her case when she overturned
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
conway's ban on short-term rentals
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
she indicated those are that a
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
short-term rental is a residential use
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the property
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
therefore because it's a residential use
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the property municipalities do not
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
have authority
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
to prevent someone who owns a
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
residential property from not using it
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
05:14:17.920 --> 05:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
in that way
so

05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not just judge ignatius who
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
came up with the decision that these are
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
residential uses of the property
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
this issue has gone to a variety of
 
05:14:29.670 --> 05:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
state supreme courts around the country
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
texas washington idaho wisconsin
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
colorado and georgia
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
have also ruled that it's a residential
 
05:14:37.520 --> 05:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
have also ruled that it's a residential
use

05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:14:38.400 --> 05:14:39.430 align:start position:0%
use
why

05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:14:41.350 --> 05:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do when i go home
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
have dinner
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk to the kids talk to
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
the family
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
watch some television go to bed maybe
 
05:14:50.230 --> 05:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
invite some friends over for a beer
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what someone who's using
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
a short-term rental is going to do so
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's a residential use of that property
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
now whether or not you agree or disagree
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
and be honest with you it doesn't even
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
may not matter what judge ignatius's
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
ruling is because this is now going to
 
05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
go to the state supreme court
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
and if the state supreme court rules
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
that it is a residential use of the
 
05:15:13.200 --> 05:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
that it is a residential use of the
property

05:15:14.550 --> 05:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
then all the municipal authority that
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about now
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to have any more
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to register
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to inspect
 
05:15:24.550 --> 05:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the same way that my private property
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
the government can't come in
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
and say i want to inspect your house
 
05:15:30.550 --> 05:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know after it's already been built
 
05:15:30.560 --> 05:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
you know after it's already been built
so

05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
the consequences of doing nothing
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we would say
 
05:15:37.760 --> 05:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we would say
unfortunately

05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
is probably going to lead to a sort of a
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
winner take all decision here they're
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
either going to be residential municipal
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
authorities gone or they're going to be
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
ruled commercial
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
in which towns cities and towns can do
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to them
 
05:15:54.550 --> 05:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
what we've tried to do with this piece
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
of legislation is to try to come up with
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of middle ground here that
 
05:16:00.550 --> 05:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
everyone can try to agree with
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i just to go over a couple of points
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
because we hear a lot about how the bill
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
is removing a town's ability to regulate
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
specifically in the bill on line 12-14
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this paragraph shall
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
limit a municipality's existing
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
authority to generally regulate parking
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
noise safety health sanitation or other
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
related municipal ordinances
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
now every time someone brought up a
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
different potential ordinance we
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
included it
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
all right so if there's anything else
 
05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
you think we missed that wouldn't be
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
included we're more than happy to put
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
into that so that towns have authority
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
to regulate
 
05:16:41.200 --> 05:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
to regulate
now

05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
it what we're saying on the the rest of
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
it which is rsa 31 which grants towns
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
different regulatory authorities under
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
the police powers
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
is you can require registration that
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
language is pulled directly from
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute that exists currently that if
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
you many people don't realize this but
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
if you rent long term
 
05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
you are mandated actually this is a may
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you're mandated to register with
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
your town so that they have someone who
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
they can reach out to uh if they needed
 
05:17:11.760 --> 05:17:12.628 align:start position:0%
they can reach out to uh if they needed
to

05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
to provide service to so it's the same
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
concept and a town can
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
initiate a fee in order to do that
 
05:17:22.948 --> 05:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
registration excuse me mr quinn uh some
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
of that testimony has been mentioned
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
before if you could if it has been
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned before could you please uh
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
sure go on further because so then the
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
second piece is also new it has to do
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
with it with an inspection so that's
 
05:17:38.550 --> 05:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibited in rsa 153 i
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
noticed the fire marshal was here
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
earlier i had a conversation with him
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
several months ago
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
about that issue and we ensured that
 
05:17:48.310 --> 05:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
and came up to an agreement on this that
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh inspection would be granted they
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
could look for the same things you would
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
look for in a long-term rental that's an
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
rsa 48 a14 in addition there's existing
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that if you do a rental you
 
05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
have to have a smoke detector and a co
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
detector so you can do the same thing if
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
a town so chooses it's not a mandate if
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
town chooses they don't want to inspect
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
it they don't have to
 
05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then just as importantly
 
05:18:13.190 --> 05:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
what i think the question was what do
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
you do
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
if a large someone does something a
 
05:18:18.550 --> 05:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
company or
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
an owner of a property were to do
 
05:18:20.000 --> 05:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
an owner of a property were to do
something

05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
what recourse would the town have the
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
town has the recourse under legislation
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
to revoke the registration deny them
 
05:18:28.550 --> 05:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to continue to
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
short-term rental right so that's again
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
something that we do not believe towns
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
currently have the authority to decide
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
and to dictate
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
quickly um you guys passed a law um last
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
year that mandates airbnb vr bureau and
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
all the other platforms have to collect
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
and remit
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
their rooms and meals tax
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
what that has done is increased rooms
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
and meals tax revenue because now
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
everyone does it
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
in this budget cycle that's going to
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
mean directly from short-term rentals
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
about 40 million dollars
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
so if towns are allowed to ban them
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
those dollars are going to start to
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
decrease and if it becomes widespread
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's eliminated
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%

that
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
this question
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
cries out for legislative direction
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
based on statewide policies promoting
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
commerce competition regulatory throat
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
control and municipal oversight she was
 
05:19:31.750 --> 05:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
basically pleading with the legislature
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
to do something if not
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just going to be portsmouth and
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
conway it's going to be town after town
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
after town that's been embroiled in
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
these lawsuits
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity here to clarify
 
05:19:44.550 --> 05:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
once and for all
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
very few communities in the state of new
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire ban short-term rentals
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's very few
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
so what we're just saying is it's an
 
05:19:55.990 --> 05:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
important private property right in the
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
past this legislature has made decisions
 
05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
on rsa 674
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
you did it on housing affordability
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
workforce housing accessory dwelling
 
05:20:04.958 --> 05:20:06.310 align:start position:0%
workforce housing accessory dwelling
units

05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
units
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
you then won a couple years ago and
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merged lots there's a
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
whole host of them where the legislature
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
has stepped in on 674 altered that and
 
05:20:15.830 --> 05:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
put mandates on the town because there
 
05:20:19.110 --> 05:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
was some overriding uh principle and the
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
principle we're trying to protect here
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
is private property rights when you
 
05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
purchase a property you get a bundle of
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
rights it's the way law school they
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
might describe it
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
sticks that you get is the ability to
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
rent out your property if one of those
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
is removed the value of that property is
 
05:20:35.120 --> 05:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
is removed the value of that property is
decreased

05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%

excuse me one second i may want to let
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
sarah speak first and she might answer
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
some of your questions
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
i may
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay please make it brief if it's
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
already been covered just skip right by
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
it sure so there were a couple of
 
05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions that were earlier that i'd
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
like to clarify um brought before this
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee and the first
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
relative to condos and
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
ccnrs so the covenants and restrictions
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
and whether or not this is going to
 
05:21:15.190 --> 05:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
remove their right
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
to regulate short-term rentals within
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
their community
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
currently the ccnrs those are things
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
that are presented to potential buyers
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
ahead of time they're very transparent
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what is going to occur
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
in those communities what the rules and
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
regulations are and then they opt in so
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
this is not taking anything away from
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
that they've already made that decision
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
that they are okay with those
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
regulations when they move into that
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:21:44.480 --> 05:21:45.270 align:start position:0%
right now
well

05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
in in that same vein
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in that community has a right
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
to vote on any changes to those ccnrs
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
currently in our private communi in our
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
public communities
 
05:22:00.070 --> 05:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
the voting rights are only for
 
05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
primary resident owners
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
only so
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
these changes that are being made on a
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
local level are being made not by
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
everyone who has a stake in that
 
05:22:11.280 --> 05:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
everyone who has a stake in that
community

05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
such as condo associations and the
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
transparency with the ccnrs they're
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
being made by the few that are there as
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:26.788 --> 05:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
the other thing is um we had talked
 
05:22:26.798 --> 05:22:27.670 align:start position:0%
the other thing is um we had talked
about

05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:22:30.310 --> 05:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis and we're all going
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
to get into that a little bit more later
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
in the day probably around dinner time
 
05:22:34.558 --> 05:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
in the day probably around dinner time
but

05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
banning short-term rentals are not going
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
to bring back the number of houses in
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
the inventory that we need
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of those short-term rentals are
 
05:22:44.718 --> 05:22:46.708 align:start position:0%
a lot of those short-term rentals are
owned

05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
owned
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
in contradiction to what has been said
 
05:22:51.670 --> 05:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
today by individuals like you and me so
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
if they are not able to do short-term
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
rentals and they use that in some form
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the year they're just not
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to rent at all they're going to
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
keep the property the property is going
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
to stay vacant until they decide to use
 
05:23:05.430 --> 05:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
it whether it's for the summer holiday
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
or for vacations or whatnot so
 
05:23:10.230 --> 05:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
by banning short-term rentals that is
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
not going to help our
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
and also there was a comment made about
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
the ownership types of llcs and
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
individuals like you and i can own
 
05:23:25.030 --> 05:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
property in an llc a trust or many other
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
forms and that is not an indication that
 
05:23:30.150 --> 05:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
they are owned by large faceless
 
05:23:30.160 --> 05:23:32.470 align:start position:0%
they are owned by large faceless
corporations

05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
05:23:34.470 --> 05:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
05:23:36.878 --> 05:23:38.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
mr

05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
mr
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
gallery so um
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
the there's a point made about
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact from the um
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
from the rooms and meals tax
 
05:23:51.200 --> 05:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
from the rooms and meals tax
that

05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
might be had here
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you know
 
05:23:57.360 --> 05:23:58.470 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you know
why

05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
that figure isn't included as a fiscal
 
05:24:01.360 --> 05:24:02.150 align:start position:0%
that figure isn't included as a fiscal
note

05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
note
 
05:24:02.160 --> 05:24:03.430 align:start position:0%
note
to

05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.920 --> 05:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:24:11.190 --> 05:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
if if
 
05:24:13.750 --> 05:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are banned in
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
communities um
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
it would i think
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
less rooms and meals revenue but that's
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
not what this is we're trying to protect
 
05:24:25.350 --> 05:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so it would protect
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
those dollars
 
05:24:27.120 --> 05:24:29.030 align:start position:0%
those dollars
um

05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
and getting into the issue of sort of
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
local control um
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
i guess the only i leave you with
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
because if if you do have that well
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
local controls supersede private
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
if town a
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
makes the determination that they're
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to ban short-term rentals
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
that does not eliminate the desire and
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
demand for visitors to come to new
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire to vacation they're still
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
going to want to come to our lakes in
 
05:24:57.590 --> 05:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
our mountains seacoast
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
so what that's going to do now is
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
someone who lives in town b which is
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
adjacent to say okay
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
i think you know if
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
now because a won't allow it i used to
 
05:25:09.750 --> 05:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
be able to get 1500 a week now i can get
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
2 000. that's going to incentivize me to
 
05:25:13.350 --> 05:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
say okay now i'm going to put a
 
05:25:15.510 --> 05:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
short-term rental in my town
 
05:25:17.990 --> 05:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that the state role is to
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
ensure at least minimal private property
 
05:25:21.200 --> 05:25:22.470 align:start position:0%
ensure at least minimal private property
protections

05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
protections
 
05:25:24.868 --> 05:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
for everybody if a town wants to
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
regulate them have at it
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
go for it
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
inspections registrations
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
if someone is
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
consistently violating noise ordinances
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
remove that registration and ban them
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
from doing it
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do is ensure that an
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
individual private property rights are
 
05:25:43.040 --> 05:25:44.548 align:start position:0%
individual private property rights are
protected

05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
protected
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
one question
 
05:25:50.788 --> 05:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
from everyone and then we're finished
 
05:25:50.798 --> 05:25:51.590 align:start position:0%
from everyone and then we're finished
okay

05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.830 --> 05:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:26:01.840 --> 05:26:02.868 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
um mr quinn at the beginning of your
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
remarks you said how
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
you go home you have dinner you talk
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
with your kids whatever and that's no
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
different than
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's
 
05:26:13.840 --> 05:26:15.030 align:start position:0%
someone who's
using

05:26:15.030 --> 05:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
a short-term rental that it's the same
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
but do consider the whole topic of
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
domicile to distinguish between those
 
05:26:23.440 --> 05:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
domicile to distinguish between those
two

05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:26:26.390 --> 05:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned also individual property
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
rights but what we've heard testimony
 
05:26:30.070 --> 05:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
already is that there's a lot of big
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
corporations buying
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
homes and using them for short-term
 
05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
rentals so i'm having a hard time
 
05:26:37.760 --> 05:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
rentals so i'm having a hard time
seeing

05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
i i see there is a difference between
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals long-term rentals
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals owned by
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
someone who makes that place their
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
domicile at least part of the year and
 
05:26:52.150 --> 05:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
and one that's owned by a company so i'd
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you clarifying that
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
i guess i can answer that question by
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
saying again
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
i guess my opinion doesn't particularly
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
matter what we're trying i'm trying to
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
get is
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
the the court is looking at this it's a
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
legal question and the legal question is
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
is it a residential use of the property
 
05:27:13.510 --> 05:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
if it is determined as a residential use
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the property as judge ignatius stated
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
then municipal is a residential use of
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
the property as judge ignatius stated
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
then municipalities do not have the
 
05:27:23.600 --> 05:27:24.788 align:start position:0%
then municipalities do not have the
authority

05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the same way that your residents or
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
my residents that they can somehow come
 
05:27:30.628 --> 05:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
in i'm not renting anything out at all
 
05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and say what we want you to register
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
your home with our you know register
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
with the town or we're going to come and
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
inspect your property
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
so the key question is residential
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
versus commercial everyone might have an
 
05:27:43.830 --> 05:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
opinion but the only opinions that going
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
to really matter are the supreme court
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
the folks across the
 
05:27:47.280 --> 05:27:48.150 align:start position:0%
the folks across the
river

05:27:48.150 --> 05:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
river
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
i would also say
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
that laconia in 2019 banned short-term
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
rentals in parts of that community
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
there are more short-term rentals now
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
than there were before the ban
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
portsmouth was in earlier talking
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
portsmouth banned short-term rentals
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
there are more short-term rentals now in
 
05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
portsmouth than there were before the
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
ban portsmouth has stated the only way
 
05:28:09.990 --> 05:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
they enforced
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
the ban is if a neighbor complains and
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
then they go investigate so imagine
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
you've been renting out your home for 30
 
05:28:15.680 --> 05:28:16.788 align:start position:0%
you've been renting out your home for 30
years

05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
all your neighbors think you're great no
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
problem whatsoever now a new neighbor
 
05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
moves in
 
05:28:23.670 --> 05:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
and they don't like it
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
and they call the town now what you've
 
05:28:27.750 --> 05:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
been doing for 30 years might be taken
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
away from you and you need that income
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
in order to keep yourself in the home
 
05:28:32.080 --> 05:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
in order to keep yourself in the home
or

05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
potentially pay for your college at your
 
05:28:36.390 --> 05:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
kids college education and that's what
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
you're relying upon for your retirement
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why private property
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
rights are so important in this issue
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason why we believe the state
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
needs to step in to ensure
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
that at least
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.150 --> 05:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
brief question please
 
05:28:59.590 --> 05:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question pertains
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
to page two
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
line two
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um
 
05:29:09.430 --> 05:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
the phrase proven violations of
 
05:29:11.670 --> 05:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
ordinances and my question is what
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
exactly constitutes
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
a proven violation of an ordinance
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
what is the due process and what body
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
so if a town for instance has a noise
 
05:29:26.638 --> 05:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
so if a town for instance has a noise
ordinance

05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
and you
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
violate that news or noise ordinance
 
05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
and you receive a summons and
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
usually when you get summons you either
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
plead guilty or you go into the court
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
you try and plead it out you argue it if
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
the court deems you are guilty then
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's a proven violation of an
 
05:29:43.200 --> 05:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
that's a proven violation of an
ordinance

05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it can't just be a complaint you
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
can't just have a neighbor saying hey
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
they were loud and the police show up
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
and say they weren't loud
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be a proven violation
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
mr maturi representative maturi thank
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
you so much mr chair thank you for
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is
 
05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
do you um
 
05:30:11.110 --> 05:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
do you see any
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the town putting
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
conditions on the registration and i and
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i the example i would give
 
05:30:19.600 --> 05:30:20.390 align:start position:0%
and i the example i would give
if

05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:30:23.590 --> 05:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to do an inspection
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they go in and determine this house
 
05:30:26.080 --> 05:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
and they go in and determine this house
has

05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
five bedrooms the septic is sized four
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
therefore your registration comes with a
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
limit of x number of people over the
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
course of a year do you see where that
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
could uh that could be permitted could
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
be allowed that's a great question so
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that came up earlier i think someone
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
said oh you have 20 people if the town
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this legislation restricts
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
the town from le from regulating the
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
number of people who are
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
utilizing a property and if a town
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that as part of a
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
registration requirement
 
05:31:00.310 --> 05:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think that they would have the
 
05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
authority under the language currently
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
written if you feel more comfortable in
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
putting something specific in there
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
that was certainly
 
05:31:11.830 --> 05:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions i'm going to
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you both for being here thank
 
05:31:16.240 --> 05:31:17.510 align:start position:0%

from kearsarge
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the editor
 
05:32:01.270 --> 05:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
realtor paul mayer writes in this paper
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
that he's worried about potential lies
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
being spread about sb 249
 
05:32:10.708 --> 05:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
regarding short-term rentals
 
05:32:10.718 --> 05:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
regarding short-term rentals
well

05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
no need to lie
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
as all one has to do is read the bill
 
05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
to see what would deprive all voters
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
in every town in new hampshire
 
05:32:25.110 --> 05:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
of their right to govern strs
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
in their community
 
05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
if mr mayor is concerned about someone
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
spreading lies
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
he need only look at his own words and i
 
05:32:34.000 --> 05:32:35.430 align:start position:0%
he need only look at his own words and i
quote

05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
quote
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take away a town's right to
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
regulate vacation rentals
 
05:32:43.830 --> 05:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
it most certainly does
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the bill that mayor
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
provides states and again i quote
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits municipalities
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
from adopting ordinances
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
read the actual bill and it's clear
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
it absolutely strips voters of their
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
rights to limit short-term rentals in
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
mayor also states
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan compromise that the
 
05:33:14.948 --> 05:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the locals have been
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
utter nonsense
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
we are these where are these locals
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
who have been asking the state to strip
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
away the rights of the registered voters
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
to determine how to govern their
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:30.628 align:start position:0%
to determine how to govern their
communities

05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
i certainly do not know any do you
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
in the 1920s the united states supreme
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
court ruled that voters in a community
 
05:33:42.390 --> 05:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
have the right to establish residential
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
and commercial areas in their towns to
 
05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
determine what commercial activities are
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
permitted in these residential areas
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
this ruling has been reaffirmed by the
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
courts countless times
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
in the ensuing decades
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
sb 249 would strip every voter in every
 
05:34:04.868 --> 05:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
community in new hampshire of that right
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
and turn dwelling units house condos or
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
townhouses into a potential str
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law every dwelling unit
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
in your town could be a potential motel
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
like sdr
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
jackson residents voted to allow
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
non-owner-occupied ncrs in their
 
05:34:28.948 --> 05:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
residential areas
 
05:34:31.670 --> 05:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
conway and kearsarge voters required
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
strs in residential areas to be owner
 
05:34:36.830 --> 05:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
occupied and
 
05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
operated while different in every case
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
it is cl clear
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
expression of the voters will
 
05:34:47.430 --> 05:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
if sb 249 becomes law it will block and
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
deny and disallow
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
that honored and revered right for
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
voters to choose
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
so who benefits from sb 249
 
05:35:01.270 --> 05:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
the tiny percentage of new hampshire
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
residents who own and operate stis or
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
service them
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
some realtors and a lot of people who
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't live in new hampshire
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
no need to conjure up lies about sp 249
 
05:35:15.350 --> 05:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
as written
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.990 --> 05:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
i personally have had a home in madison
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
for 34 years
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
we're surrounded by sdrs
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%

the str that's beside me catered to pets
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
people would come
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
they'd leave four dogs in the house
 
05:35:46.230 --> 05:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
and go shopping for four hours the dogs
 
05:35:46.240 --> 05:35:47.350 align:start position:0%
and go shopping for four hours the dogs
would

05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:35:49.590 --> 05:35:49.600 align:start position:0%

you cannot have more regulatory power
 
05:42:49.750 --> 05:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
then requiring a permit and having the

05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
the local level the only thing it does
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
not allow you to do is an outright ban

economic boost to this state that's
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to go away if we don't have the

05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
many as you want
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
diane power
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:45:59.110 --> 05:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
um my question pertains to page two
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three is there anything in
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
the framework of this bill that
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
prohibits an owner of this short-term
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
rental from reapplying and re therefore
 
05:46:09.760 --> 05:46:12.150 align:start position:0%
rental from reapplying and re therefore
re-registering

05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
re-registering
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
after the registration has been revoked
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think that that's up to how the town
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
the town or city can craft the
 
05:46:26.160 --> 05:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
the town or city can craft the
permitting

05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance as they see fit
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think this leaves certainly room for
 
05:46:31.680 --> 05:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
i think this leaves certainly room for
that

05:46:32.390 --> 05:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
so if in
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
if you've been revoked and the town of
 
05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
city gives a certain
 
05:46:37.600 --> 05:46:38.548 align:start position:0%
city gives a certain
um

05:46:38.548 --> 05:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know period
 
05:46:42.868 --> 05:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
for which you cannot reapply i don't see
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
any reason that this is prohibited by
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the by the uh the bill i'd also add that
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use which there was much
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
debate about is not even in here if you
 
05:46:55.190 --> 05:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
read it it talks about non-conforming
 
05:46:57.030 --> 05:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
structures that's a whole different
 
05:47:00.310 --> 05:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
ballgame that simply means that a
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
building that hasn't been used and the
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
zoning is changed or maybe requiring
 
05:47:07.270 --> 05:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
more of a lot coverage or a different
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
setback regime that that cannot be used
 
05:47:10.080 --> 05:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
setback regime that that cannot be used
to

05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit the
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
the use of the building as a short-term
 
05:47:18.310 --> 05:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
rental it's not about a non-conforming
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
use at all
 
05:47:19.840 --> 05:47:20.788 align:start position:0%
use at all
um

05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:22.628 --> 05:47:22.638 align:start position:0%

05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just talk about one
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
thing because it's a it's a relevant
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
issue and i hope you'll read my
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
testimony because i spent a lot of time
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
on it we certainly will i am
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
the chair of the freedom planning board
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm entering my 15th year in that
 
05:48:17.680 --> 05:48:19.350 align:start position:0%
i'm entering my 15th year in that
position

05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:48:22.868 --> 05:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
freedom is a small town just about 1700
 
05:48:22.878 --> 05:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
freedom is a small town just about 1700
people

05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
southeast of conway if you've never
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
heard of it or been there
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
and we are on ossipee lake and over half
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
of the homes in freedom
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
are second homes
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we started a year ago to try to
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
address the issue of what to do about
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we set a goal
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
same thing to try to strike a balance
 
05:48:50.708 --> 05:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
between the people who said
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want a stream of strangers as
 
05:48:53.680 --> 05:48:55.110 align:start position:0%
i don't want a stream of strangers as
neighbors

05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the people who wanted to rent out
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
their houses as short-term rentals
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to pay
 
05:49:02.160 --> 05:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to pay
particular

05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
attention to people who have had summer
 
05:49:08.470 --> 05:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
homes and freedom
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes for generations
 
05:49:13.830 --> 05:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
who wanted to rent out their houses
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that they could pay taxes and keep
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
these homes in their families
 
05:49:24.070 --> 05:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
we also wanted to figure out a way to
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
avoid having investors who wanted to buy
 
05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
up homes rent them out at a profit
 
05:49:30.718 --> 05:49:31.910 align:start position:0%
up homes rent them out at a profit
from

05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
coming to freedom and creating many
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
hotels in our residential neighborhoods
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
we chose and the voters approved to
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
limit short-term rentals to 90 days a
 
05:49:44.160 --> 05:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
limit short-term rentals to 90 days a
year

05:49:45.030 --> 05:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
we talked about whether we would do only
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
owner-occupied rentals that's not our
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
market the people who are renting their
 
05:49:54.788 --> 05:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
houses out
 
05:49:57.670 --> 05:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
as short-term rentals and freedom are
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
are not living in freedom they're second
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners and we looked at the
 
05:50:07.990 --> 05:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
taxes the assessed value in town what
 
05:50:09.590 --> 05:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
people were getting a night for
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
what the mortgage rates were
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and running the numbers we figured out
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
that at 90 days people could pay their
 
05:50:22.150 --> 05:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
taxes their insurance
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
and a decent sized mortgage
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
over the 90 days
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's profit and we wanted to stop
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
investors from coming in and if you look
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
at the numbers
 
05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
at a home that's rented at 250 dollars a
 
05:50:39.840 --> 05:50:41.430 align:start position:0%
at a home that's rented at 250 dollars a
night

05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
night
 
05:50:41.440 --> 05:50:42.868 align:start position:0%
night
for

05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
300 days
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
after you pay
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of your
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
mortgage you're making a huge amount of
 
05:50:51.120 --> 05:50:52.628 align:start position:0%
mortgage you're making a huge amount of
money

05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:50:57.270 --> 05:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
50 70 000 a year every year
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
we we took an approach that's different
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
from the one that you've been asking
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
about which is we'll just make them
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
owner occupied
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
we said let's find a way for our
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
property owners who are
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
second homeowners who want some revenue
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we did it by
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
restricting it and we did
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
have it passed
 
05:51:19.680 --> 05:51:20.868 align:start position:0%
have it passed
and

05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:22.390 --> 05:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
you will consider among other things
 
05:51:25.840 --> 05:51:27.510 align:start position:0%
you will consider among other things
grandfathering

05:51:27.510 --> 05:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
grandfathering
 
05:51:27.520 --> 05:51:28.868 align:start position:0%
grandfathering
the

05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulations that towns already have in
 
05:51:31.440 --> 05:51:32.548 align:start position:0%
regulations that towns already have in
place

05:51:32.548 --> 05:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:51:35.110 --> 05:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
when this law goes into effect
 
05:51:37.990 --> 05:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
because we have worked for a year and we
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
i think we have a good plan i'm sure
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
their people are going to tell me
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to sue us about it
 
05:51:44.558 --> 05:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
they're going to sue us about it
but

05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
if it's going to pass i hope you will
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
weigh the interest of
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
all of the people in the towns
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
and and give us a break thank you so
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and thank you
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
for being patient with us
 
05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
john i know you've asked for five
 
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
minutes i'd like to yep
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
shorten that as much as you can no i
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
don't repeat what everyone has said
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
05:52:14.798 --> 05:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
um

05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:17.110 --> 05:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
just like several of the previous
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
speakers i have a airbnb that started
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
next door to me
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
it was rented out every weekend
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
different people coming for a couple of
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
days there'd be 12 people it's a 2500
 
05:52:32.390 --> 05:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
square foot branch there'd be 12 cars
 
05:52:33.750 --> 05:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
so someone's saying this is just a
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
normal house next to you it's not this
 
05:52:37.590 --> 05:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
is not how normal houses are you don't
 
05:52:39.990 --> 05:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
have different people piling in 12 cars
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
every friday night making loud noises
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
having their dogs running your yard
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to your back door when you go to
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
walking through your yard those are
 
05:52:49.910 --> 05:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
things when you have neighbors you work
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
out you say
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you can walk my dog or not
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'd love to see my back door or not but
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you have different people every
 
05:52:58.070 --> 05:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
weekend you have no relationship they're
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
not part of the community
 
05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're just strangers
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
they're there for their two days they're
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
there for their party they're there for
 
05:53:04.948 --> 05:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
their grandmother's party they're there
 
05:53:06.548 --> 05:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
for their bachelor party they're there
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
for their girlfriend's party they're
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
there for their whatever party it is
 
05:53:13.110 --> 05:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons there is because
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is affordable
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
there's 12 of them there they spend 20
 
05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they get to spend the weekend
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
so there's it's not a competing with a
 
05:53:23.430 --> 05:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
hotel it's it's bringing in large
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
numbers of people to take advantage of a
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that's quiet
 
05:53:28.948 --> 05:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
and totally disrupt what's a normal
 
05:53:28.958 --> 05:53:30.548 align:start position:0%
and totally disrupt what's a normal
neighborhood

05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
in dublin we've passed an ordinance two
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:53:36.310 --> 05:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
cups we have special exceptions and we
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a minimum of two week rentals for
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
non-owner occupants
 
05:53:45.430 --> 05:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
so what we call a short-term transient
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
rental is under two weeks and that's
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
banned for non-resident
 
05:53:51.270 --> 05:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
and that has controlled the problem
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
entirely the problem here is
 
05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
these weekend kind of overloaded visits
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
with tons of people piling in
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's not people renting out their houses
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's not people doing vacation rentals
 
05:54:04.628 --> 05:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's not a family like you see on tv in
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
the commercial it's a business it's a
 
05:54:09.350 --> 05:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
function hall it's an event center
 
05:54:10.470 --> 05:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
 
05:54:14.548 --> 05:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
especially thank you for your patience
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
05:54:26.830 --> 05:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
dublin pass and ordinance and it's been
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
successful is that available on their
 
05:54:29.040 --> 05:54:30.070 align:start position:0%
successful is that available on their
website

05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes our zoning ordinance is available on
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
the website okay thank you
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and thank you
 
05:54:38.548 --> 05:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
for enduring the
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the delays that we had
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
so that's going to end the
 
05:55:06.150 --> 05:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.350 --> 05:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's what happens when you
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
hand your card in at 10 30 for an 11 30
 
05:55:12.868 --> 05:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
hearing all right i also have a card for
 
05:55:12.878 --> 05:55:15.830 align:start position:0%
hearing all right i also have a card for
for

05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
good morning good afternoon i almost
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
said good morning i'm margaret burns i'm
 
05:55:25.590 --> 05:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the new
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and we
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition to senate bill
 
05:55:29.440 --> 05:55:30.788 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition to senate bill
249.

05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
249.
 
05:55:32.708 --> 05:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that short-term some
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals operate responsibly
 
05:55:37.030 --> 05:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
and there is no doubt that short-term
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
rentals can play a part in new
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy but that's not what
 
05:55:42.628 --> 05:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is about this bill presents a
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
very simple question to this committee
 
05:55:46.470 --> 05:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
and the question is whether one
 
05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
particular use of land
 
05:55:51.030 --> 05:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
one industry in fact should be totally
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
exempt from fundamental principles of
 
05:55:53.280 --> 05:55:54.310 align:start position:0%
exempt from fundamental principles of
zoning

05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 would allow short-term
 
05:55:59.670 --> 05:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
rentals everywhere to representative
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
rung's question earlier this bill would
 
05:56:04.150 --> 05:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
not allow a municipality to allow
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals in some districts but
 
05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
not in other districts that is the way
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bill reads
 
05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
to this end it would be an unprecedented
 
05:56:14.470 --> 05:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
incursion on the most fundamental aspect
 
05:56:16.628 --> 05:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
of municipal authority which is local
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
zoning authority
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
other than the tilling of soil and the
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
harvesting of crops there is no other
 
05:56:25.830 --> 05:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
land use that is allowed in every
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
district and every area within a
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
municipality if senate bill 249 passed
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
it would be growing your own food and
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
renting properties as short-term rentals
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would be exempt from zoning
 
05:56:37.200 --> 05:56:38.628 align:start position:0%
that would be exempt from zoning
authority

05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
why is this such a fundamental piece of
 
05:56:43.270 --> 05:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
zoning it's because zoning at its most
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental level is the separation of
 
05:56:48.390 --> 05:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
different types of uses there is nothing
 
05:56:51.030 --> 05:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
surprising or different about this
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
residential uses are separated from
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
industrial uses from commercial uses
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
indeed even single-family homes can be
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited in certain areas because we
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
have districts that are dedicated purely
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
to industrial and commercial but under
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 again short-term rentals
 
05:57:11.430 --> 05:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
would have to be allowed everywhere
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 does not even allow
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities to distinguish between
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
owner-occupied properties and properties
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
that are purchased by investment
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
companies properties that have no intent
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
of being used as residential properties
 
05:57:26.628 --> 05:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
are not for people to live in as
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
long-term residents and are operated as
 
05:57:31.430 --> 05:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
short-term rental businesses with no
 
05:57:33.510 --> 05:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
regard for the local community the
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
residents or the local ordinances
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
as a result this bill is not about
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
what's good for local residents it's
 
05:57:43.110 --> 05:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
about what's good for absentee landlords
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
who buy up properties
 
05:57:46.708 --> 05:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
i would also point you to the very
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
language of the bill as conflicting and
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
deeply problematic on the one hand
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
short-term rental and vacation rental
 
05:57:57.030 --> 05:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
is defined as a single family or two
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
family building or structure
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
however the bill also clearly states
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
that any building or structure must be
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
allowed as a short-term rental
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of its classification use or
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
occupancy and regardless of whether it
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
is conforming or non-conforming
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
this means to representative powers
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
question earlier on yes not only must
 
05:58:22.470 --> 05:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
residential properties be allowed as
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so must any other
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
structure a barn a shed a pool house an
 
05:58:31.750 --> 05:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
office that is how this bill reads
 
05:58:34.390 --> 05:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
for that reason this bill is also not
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
modeled after the adu statute that was
 
05:58:39.830 --> 05:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
passed several years ago the adu statute
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
requires municipalities to allow by
 
05:58:42.558 --> 05:58:43.430 align:start position:0%
requires municipalities to allow by
right

05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
by special exception or by conditional
 
05:58:49.190 --> 05:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
use permit accessory dwelling units in
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
zones where single-family homes are
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
allowed again this bill allows strs
 
05:58:57.670 --> 05:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere in a municipality
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
proponents have also claimed that senate
 
05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill 249 grants new authority to
 
05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities but this is not accurate
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 4717 for cities and rsa 41 section
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
11c already grant cities and towns the
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
power to require regulations relative to
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
obtaining municipal permits
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have the
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
authority to require health and safety
 
05:59:24.868 --> 05:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
inspections as a condition of granting a
 
05:59:26.948 --> 05:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
special use permit or a conditional use
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
permit and the part of the bill that
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
talks about regulating noise parking
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
health sanitation and enforcing other
 
05:59:35.910 --> 05:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
town regulations merely restricts
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
authority that municipalities already
 
05:59:38.000 --> 05:59:39.110 align:start position:0%
authority that municipalities already
have

05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill have also claimed
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill is necessary to ensure
 
05:59:45.910 --> 05:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
there is not a ban on short-term rentals
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
however i would offer to you that senate
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill 249 is a ban on local residents and
 
05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
their ability to enact local zoning
 
05:59:55.510 --> 05:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances to deal with issues that
 
05:59:57.270 --> 05:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
affect them locally
 
05:59:59.670 --> 05:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore bans on short-term rentals
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
are not what we are hearing about and is
 
06:00:03.190 --> 06:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
not what we are seeing and hearing
 
06:00:05.350 --> 06:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities doing instead
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities are working to enact
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
regulations to properly incorporate
 
06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals into their
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
communities without letting them overrun
 
06:00:16.230 --> 06:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
their communities to that end in about
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
27 municipalities there are various
 
06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
regulations and zoning ordinances that
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
deal with things such as limiting where
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are allowed limiting
 
06:00:28.310 --> 06:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
them to owner-occupied air rentals in
 
06:00:30.310 --> 06:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
some areas limiting days of the year
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
they may be renting requiring
 
06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
registration requiring safety
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
inspections imposing limits on occupancy
 
06:00:39.030 --> 06:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
and parking for the health safety and
 
06:00:41.670 --> 06:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
welfare of the community
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
many of these local ordinances would
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
simply be preempted upon passage of
 
06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249.
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
i know you've heard a lot of speakers
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
today and this has been a long hearing
 
06:00:53.670 --> 06:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
so i will close by saying that i in my
 
06:00:56.150 --> 06:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
time of nhma have not only are hearing
 
06:00:57.830 --> 06:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
from local officials in strong
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill but i have
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps never heard from so many
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
residents asking me why this bill is
 
06:01:05.350 --> 06:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
happening and what they can do to stop
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
it and to ask legislators to hear the
 
06:01:09.510 --> 06:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
issues that they are facing in their
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
communities and that will only become
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
more significant if short-term rentals
 
06:01:15.990 --> 06:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
are required to be allowed everywhere
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
and if basic fundamentals of zoning are
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
overridden by senate bill 249. for these
 
06:01:22.470 --> 06:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
reasons we would ask you to recommend
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill as inexpedient to legislate
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonnell you have a
 
06:01:26.798 --> 06:01:28.948 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonnell you have a
question

06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
just a quick question we've heard a lot
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
about that court case in conway
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
if that would come out that a short term
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
renter was a use for a residence how's
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
it going to affect the communities
 
06:01:43.510 --> 06:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
conway's case is about conway's
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance conway's case is about whether
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
their zoning ordinance
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
adequately or sufficiently or correctly
 
06:01:52.868 --> 06:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
regulated this use that they are trying
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
to regulate it wasn't about a statewide
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
definition of residential versus
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
commercial so i can't agree with the
 
06:02:02.310 --> 06:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
classification of the case as i've heard
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
it here before by prior speakers
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%

and so
no

06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%

06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%

06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
back sure
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.830 --> 06:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you committee
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
um i'm proud to be back and i am still
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
senator regina bertsell from district
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
19. the um
 
06:03:10.470 --> 06:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
i support the towns of hampstead windham
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
and derry and i'm the prime sponsor of
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 251 and hopefully this is a
 
06:03:17.110 --> 06:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
much simpler bill than the one you just
 
06:03:17.120 --> 06:03:19.510 align:start position:0%
much simpler bill than the one you just
heard

06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
um 251 senate bill 251 was brought to us
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
a request brought to us by a few
 
06:03:26.080 --> 06:03:27.590 align:start position:0%
a request brought to us by a few
constituents

06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it basically adjusts
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
membership of advisory boards of tiff or
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
tax increment financing districts to um
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully to ensure a little bit fairer
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
representation of business and compute
 
06:03:42.070 --> 06:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
community interests uh rather than just
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
the properties inside so basically we're
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
just trying to i we're just trying to
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
open up tiff
 
06:03:50.470 --> 06:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
advisory boards to allow a member of the
 
06:03:52.470 --> 06:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
business community as well as property
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
owners in that district
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is the extent of my testimony
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any uh questions for
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%

association and we're here to just
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
comment on the bill
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
we wanted to thank the senate for
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
amending the bill to include
 
06:04:58.150 --> 06:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
a member of the advisory board who has
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
an is an owner and occupant of real
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
property within that community so we
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended with that
 
06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
language however we did bring up a
 
06:05:07.830 --> 06:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
concern early on and we're going to
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate that concern that the bill
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
uses the word community rather than
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivision or municipality
 
06:05:17.830 --> 06:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
and the word community is not defined
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere in rsa so it would just be in
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion a simple amendment to just
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
change the term community to be more
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
befitting so it's consistent through the
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
rsas and that's all i have for you today
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
unless you have any questions oh that
 
06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
was facial representative guthrie
 
06:05:38.070 --> 06:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
taking mike my question it's a dumb
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
question but i'm a loud one
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i haven't used it yet so
 
06:05:46.150 --> 06:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you bear with me
 
06:05:46.160 --> 06:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
if you bear with me
uh

06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say how this committee is
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
going to be set up was going to be
 
06:05:52.470 --> 06:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
elected appointed
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that somewhere else
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm missing or what it's defined in
 
06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
the other aspects of the rsa so that's
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's already in the statute yes all
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'm noticing on
 
06:06:10.638 --> 06:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'm noticing on
lines

06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
lines
 
06:06:13.750 --> 06:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
six and seven
 
06:06:13.760 --> 06:06:14.628 align:start position:0%
six and seven
um

06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
it the
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
or adjacent to the development
 
06:06:19.280 --> 06:06:20.708 align:start position:0%
or adjacent to the development
district

06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:06:23.910 --> 06:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
so this this is describing the members
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
um has been struck does that refer to a
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
butter and my question is
 
06:06:32.708 --> 06:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
is it a butter not um a community
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
interest stakeholder why would a if it
 
06:06:37.750 --> 06:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
isn't a butter why would they not be
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
part of this this membership
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't preclude that from
 
06:06:43.750 --> 06:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
happening um the prior version of the
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
bill prior to amendment was there wasn't
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyone who owned real property as part
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee so i they struck that
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
language because it doesn't preclude
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
other people from being and it just
 
06:06:57.430 --> 06:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
requires that one member be an owner of
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
real property
 
06:07:00.080 --> 06:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
real property
okay

06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%

and i did have a
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the hearing
 
06:07:14.400 --> 06:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the hearing
on

06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:07:18.390 --> 06:07:18.400 align:start position:0%

floor is yours thank you uh chairman
 
06:07:59.430 --> 06:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
dolan and members of the committee
 
06:08:01.510 --> 06:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
my name is david bouton
 
06:08:03.270 --> 06:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a town councilman in hooksett new
 
06:08:03.280 --> 06:08:04.548 align:start position:0%
i'm a town councilman in hooksett new
hampshire

06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm the chair of the tip advisory board
 
06:08:10.868 --> 06:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
and have some other
 
06:08:13.830 --> 06:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
involvements but
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
i used to be in the senate and i was in
 
06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
the house at one time so this is kind of
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
a i haven't been back here for several
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
years but it's enjoyable to be here
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand is membership of the
 
06:08:29.270 --> 06:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
tip advisory board
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
currently statute limits it to
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
someone who lives in the district or
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the district
 
06:08:39.670 --> 06:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is widen
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
because we find over the last three
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
years that i've been on the committee we
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
find that we have vacancies and we have
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
a hard time to fill those vacancies
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is expand
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
the pool
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
of individuals who might be interested
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
in serving on the tip advisory board
 
06:08:59.830 --> 06:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
06:08:59.840 --> 06:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
and that's
generally

06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
generally
 
06:09:03.510 --> 06:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
in general that's only what this bill is
 
06:09:03.520 --> 06:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
in general that's only what this bill is
doing

06:09:04.470 --> 06:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
not changing any other aspect of the
 
06:09:07.200 --> 06:09:10.708 align:start position:0%
not changing any other aspect of the
statute

06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
that ends my testimony mr chairman okay
 
06:09:14.470 --> 06:09:14.480 align:start position:0%

and we're here to support senate bill
273

06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
273
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
senator bradley's representative so
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
wonderfully introduced this bill this
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill would allow towns to authorize
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
bonds at special meetings without court
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
approval so it could expedite the
 
06:12:07.750 --> 06:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
process for moving these federal funds
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
forward that do require some kind of
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
match because the size and scope of
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
these projects are so significant a bond
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
issue may have to be
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
taken up by a community
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation is also supported by
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
bond council
 
06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i think you might have received
 
06:12:27.270 --> 06:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony from bond council on
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
and over the next several years we have
 
06:12:32.868 --> 06:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
122 million dollars in the capital
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
projects fund that came in through arpa
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%

06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%

million dollars coming in immediately to
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire over the next several
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
months we wanted to be
 
06:12:55.590 --> 06:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
ready and have towns have the ability to
 
06:12:57.190 --> 06:12:57.200 align:start position:0%

assessments of taxable property
 
06:14:58.470 --> 06:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
bill provides that the assessors and
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
selectmen shall as part of creating an
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
annual revised inventory of taxable
 
06:15:06.310 --> 06:15:06.320 align:start position:0%

06:15:08.788 --> 06:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
in existing appraisals it's very short
 
06:15:08.798 --> 06:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
in existing appraisals it's very short
bill

06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
really only one sentence that was
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
corrected in here
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that's on line three
 
06:15:17.670 --> 06:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
and basically it says
 
06:15:20.150 --> 06:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
annually in in accordance with state
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
assessing guidelines the assessors and
 
06:15:22.320 --> 06:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
assessing guidelines the assessors and
selectmen

06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
06:15:25.510 --> 06:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
shall adjust assessments to reflect
 
06:15:25.520 --> 06:15:26.548 align:start position:0%
shall adjust assessments to reflect
changes

06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
changes
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
and to correct any errors in existing
 
06:15:28.958 --> 06:15:30.628 align:start position:0%
and to correct any errors in existing
appraisals

06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
appraisals
 
06:15:33.110 --> 06:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that all assessments are reasonably
 
06:15:36.150 --> 06:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
proportional within the municipality
 
06:15:38.708 --> 06:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
i believe this sentence was not in here
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
as before
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
and that's the really only change
 
06:15:44.548 --> 06:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
in the bill and it puts it back where
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
originally stated started from
 
06:15:49.750 --> 06:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's uh any questions
 
06:15:53.110 --> 06:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
you have a microphone that works yeah
 
06:15:57.030 --> 06:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:15:59.350 --> 06:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
is that not done now i mean do they file
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
these i mean do assessors and selectmen
 
06:16:05.360 --> 06:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
these i mean do assessors and selectmen
file

06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
file
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
their annual
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
inventory and not correct errors um they
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
file but sometimes the the
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
i guess they have a uh
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
i guess the first of april they're
 
06:16:19.590 --> 06:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
pretty busy with this stuff and
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they may miss something
 
06:16:21.520 --> 06:16:22.390 align:start position:0%
sometimes they may miss something
um

06:16:22.390 --> 06:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:22.400 --> 06:16:23.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:16:23.110 --> 06:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
it it it actually says correcting any
 
06:16:25.600 --> 06:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
it it it actually says correcting any
errors

06:16:26.470 --> 06:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
errors
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
and and before it i think it just said
 
06:16:30.788 --> 06:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
correcting errors or something selling
 
06:16:32.150 --> 06:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
on those lines
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it was explained to
 
06:16:34.548 --> 06:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
me so
 
06:16:37.110 --> 06:16:37.120 align:start position:0%

taking my question
 
06:16:39.920 --> 06:16:40.788 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:16:40.788 --> 06:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:42.310 --> 06:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to understand what the
 
06:16:45.910 --> 06:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
genesis of this this bill is
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
just basically what i said there was a
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill was pretty much
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh before
 
06:16:53.920 --> 06:16:54.788 align:start position:0%
uh before
okay

06:16:54.788 --> 06:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:16:56.470 --> 06:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
then they had it changed and now they're
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
changing it back because they found it
 
06:17:00.230 --> 06:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
didn't work too well follow-up mr chair
 
06:17:00.240 --> 06:17:00.948 align:start position:0%
didn't work too well follow-up mr chair
yeah

06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:17:02.948 --> 06:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to know if it pertains to
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the court case involving the
 
06:17:09.590 --> 06:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
merrimack premium outlets versus the
 
06:17:11.990 --> 06:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack i'm not sure about
 
06:17:14.628 --> 06:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
that and if you want to pursue and ask
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
he may be able to give you more
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
06:17:20.400 --> 06:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
information on that
okay

06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:21.280 --> 06:17:24.390 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:26.390 --> 06:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr vice
 
06:17:28.868 --> 06:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question um the way
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
i look at this is that it may
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of tax abatements
 
06:17:37.510 --> 06:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
that a select board may be
 
06:17:37.520 --> 06:17:38.708 align:start position:0%
that a select board may be
uh

06:17:38.708 --> 06:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:40.548 --> 06:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
asked for every year
 
06:17:42.548 --> 06:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
possible but uh you know it comes on a
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis thank you
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
i think that's it
 
06:17:54.948 --> 06:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
and uh mr grace you have uh some input
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
from the nhma
 
06:18:01.990 --> 06:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman h graves for the
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association we
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
06:18:07.670 --> 06:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
um to answer representative power's
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
question yes this does originate from
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
the merrimack premium outlets versus
 
06:18:13.110 --> 06:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack uh decision that was
 
06:18:15.030 --> 06:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
issued october 1st
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
2021 and i apologize to the committee i
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony but not
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
until this afternoon and it reflects
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm about to tell you
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
essentially what happened in that case
 
06:18:27.430 --> 06:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
is that the town of merrimack had
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
assessed the property they later learned
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the market assessed that property
 
06:18:33.190 --> 06:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
to higher value
 
06:18:36.150 --> 06:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
and a collateral for a loan process so
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
the town adjusted its assessment
 
06:18:40.948 --> 06:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
that was then challenged by the property
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
owners saying you're not allowed to do
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
that there's a reevaluation process
 
06:18:46.548 --> 06:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
every five years that's the proper time
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
at which you can re-evaluate
 
06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
reassess the value of our property
 
06:18:54.430 --> 06:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court upheld that
 
06:18:54.440 --> 06:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court upheld that
[Music]

06:18:55.590 --> 06:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:18:55.600 --> 06:18:56.548 align:start position:0%
[Music]
that

06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:18:59.190 --> 06:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
or the supreme court said that
 
06:19:01.430 --> 06:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
the property owner's interpretation of
 
06:19:04.310 --> 06:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the existing language was correct um as
 
06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative piemante said the
 
06:19:07.590 --> 06:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
language used to read
 
06:19:07.600 --> 06:19:08.948 align:start position:0%
language used to read
differently

06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
differently
 
06:19:11.510 --> 06:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and was basically the same as it would
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
be adjusted back to now and that would
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to adjust
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
the assessments to accurately reflect
 
06:19:21.510 --> 06:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
the market value of properties
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
as they learn what those market values
 
06:19:23.680 --> 06:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
as they learn what those market values
are

06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:19:26.230 --> 06:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
so in the case of a commercial property
 
06:19:28.390 --> 06:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
like the merrimack premium outlets
 
06:19:30.150 --> 06:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
unlike a housing market where you can
 
06:19:33.190 --> 06:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
look at comparable values there probably
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
aren't many similar properties of that
 
06:19:38.070 --> 06:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
type around so
 
06:19:39.830 --> 06:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
for housing market the way you assess
 
06:19:43.030 --> 06:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
them is you look at comparable sales um
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know where there are
 
06:19:49.590 --> 06:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
large shopping plazas they're not
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
sold very frequently
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's difficult to figure out what
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
the correct assessment is but if you do
 
06:19:57.990 --> 06:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
find out what that
 
06:20:00.708 --> 06:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
what the private market is uh valuing
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
those at you can correctly
 
06:20:05.590 --> 06:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh determine their value and correctly
 
06:20:07.830 --> 06:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
set your assessment and so that that was
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
the issue that we're trying to correct
 
06:20:09.360 --> 06:20:10.468 align:start position:0%
the issue that we're trying to correct
here

06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:20:13.030 --> 06:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that the town of merrimack
 
06:20:15.910 --> 06:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
and any other municipality
 
06:20:15.920 --> 06:20:16.788 align:start position:0%
and any other municipality
which

06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:20:19.110 --> 06:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
has a situation where they learn that
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the valuation is incorrect doesn't
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to wait for five years or up to
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
five years
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:20:29.910 --> 06:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
change that during the next period
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
when they adjust values that they do for
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere around town
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:39.430 --> 06:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes
 
06:20:41.110 --> 06:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
grays for taking my question
 
06:20:45.750 --> 06:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit nitpicky but i
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
wonder about the choice of the word
 
06:20:48.000 --> 06:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
wonder about the choice of the word
errors

06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
errors
 
06:20:51.030 --> 06:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
an error can be defined as any number of
 
06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
different things and what you just
 
06:20:56.000 --> 06:20:57.750 align:start position:0%
different things and what you just
described

06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
described
 
06:21:00.468 --> 06:21:00.478 align:start position:0%
really didn't strike me as an error
 
06:21:02.270 --> 06:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
it struck me as a
 
06:21:04.948 --> 06:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
miscalculation or a re-evaluation and
 
06:21:07.270 --> 06:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just worried that you know could
 
06:21:09.910 --> 06:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
this word be construed should the bill
 
06:21:11.430 --> 06:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
be passed
 
06:21:14.070 --> 06:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that the framers of the bill
 
06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
did not intend
 
06:21:16.708 --> 06:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
as i
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
recall it that was the terminology used
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court and therefore this
 
06:21:21.760 --> 06:21:22.868 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court and therefore this
just

06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:21:27.190 --> 06:21:27.200 align:start position:0%

06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
a representative for 18 years whenever a
 
06:23:52.390 --> 06:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
listing was made the following phrase
 
06:23:54.468 --> 06:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
was always included
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
06:24:00.548 --> 06:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
that is the little catch-all that allows
 
06:24:02.468 --> 06:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
if you have missed something in a
 
06:24:05.190 --> 06:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
listing then what happens is it doesn't
 
06:24:07.830 --> 06:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
automatically be removed or not
 
06:24:07.840 --> 06:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
automatically be removed or not
considered

06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
however the phrasing was not included in

process
 
06:24:36.160 --> 06:24:36.948 align:start position:0%
process
so

06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:40.628 --> 06:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh the justices going on to the reason
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we're here is that the justices
 
06:24:45.830 --> 06:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
concluded in merrimack on premium
 
06:24:48.548 --> 06:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
outlets versus the town of merrimack who
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
you just heard from
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
that the statutory scheme
 
06:24:54.628 --> 06:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
in its current form
 
06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
does not allow for the correction of
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
even known errors in valuation prior to
 
06:25:02.350 --> 06:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
the next
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
municipality-wide reappraisal
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
accordingly we conclude the justices
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
concluded that the oath in rsa 757 for
 
06:25:12.000 --> 06:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
concluded that the oath in rsa 757 for
selectmen

06:25:13.190 --> 06:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
that all taxable property they have to
 
06:25:18.708 --> 06:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
swear to this every year that all
 
06:25:20.948 --> 06:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
taxable property was appraised to the
 
06:25:23.750 --> 06:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
best of our knowledge and belief at its
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
full value
 
06:25:27.990 --> 06:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that must be read as certifying that the
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
last legally authorized appraisal or
 
06:25:35.670 --> 06:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment at the time was legal and
 
06:25:37.430 --> 06:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
the asb does not agree with this ruling
 
06:25:43.030 --> 06:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that is why we are here requesting
 
06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
the change put forth in senate bill 312.
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thanks for your
 
06:26:38.788 --> 06:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
testimony today i i wanted to add a
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
little comment to say this is a two-way
 
06:26:43.590 --> 06:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
street i own a property in dover and it
 
06:26:46.390 --> 06:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
was assessed by the assessors
 
06:26:48.468 --> 06:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
improperly and the poor city of dover
 
06:26:50.548 --> 06:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
had to wait five years
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
before they could uh get some more money
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:57.190 --> 06:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
well the
 
06:27:00.390 --> 06:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
point of the assessment is that it is
 
06:27:03.030 --> 06:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable and proportional
 
06:27:05.350 --> 06:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
to all of the uh
 
06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
properties within that community i know
 
06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you have to well you got you

gilmanton

06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
gilmanton
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is about fairness
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
as the representative said that in the
 
06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
city of dover
 
06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
she was
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
not charged what it should have cost for
 
06:27:52.230 --> 06:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
her taxes but on the other hand if
 
06:27:53.910 --> 06:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
she had been
 
06:27:55.430 --> 06:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
charged too much she could have asked
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
for an abatement gone through the
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
abatement process
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
so again this to make the playing field
 
06:28:01.200 --> 06:28:02.390 align:start position:0%
so again this to make the playing field
level

06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:28:04.150 --> 06:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
and certainly the assessing standards
 
06:28:08.070 --> 06:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
board as one of your members is a uh
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
one of our our best attending members
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
um that they do try to do a good job and
 
06:28:16.230 --> 06:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
look out for
 
06:28:18.150 --> 06:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
both the cities and towns but if you
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't charge the right amount
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
because of a scribner's error or
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that the the record is
 
06:28:26.478 --> 06:28:28.390 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that the the record is
incorrect

06:28:28.390 --> 06:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
06:28:29.910 --> 06:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
you can't do it
 
06:28:32.548 --> 06:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
without the changes in this bill
 
06:28:32.558 --> 06:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
without the changes in this bill
and

06:28:33.990 --> 06:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:35.830 --> 06:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
the other people who've testified
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
especially the chair of the assessing
 
06:28:39.910 --> 06:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
standards board has probably answered
 
06:28:41.910 --> 06:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
all your questions and i can go home and
 
06:28:44.948 --> 06:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
have tacos with the grandkids
 
06:28:46.708 --> 06:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
well we're going to try to help get you
 
06:28:48.948 --> 06:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh to the taco uh
 
06:28:51.750 --> 06:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes senator power i mean uh
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
06:28:53.680 --> 06:28:54.468 align:start position:0%
representative power
i

06:28:54.468 --> 06:28:54.478 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:28:56.868 --> 06:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
was that a promotion or a demotion when
 
06:28:58.468 --> 06:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
he caught i'm not sure
 
06:29:00.150 --> 06:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
i've been told i've been told it's a
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
demotion but you know what can i say
 
06:29:04.230 --> 06:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:29:07.990 --> 06:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
on line three
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to the word change i
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
assume that that
 
06:29:15.190 --> 06:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
means changes to the property
 
06:29:17.030 --> 06:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
06:29:20.628 --> 06:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
um on line three
 
06:29:22.708 --> 06:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
to correct any errors in the existing
 
06:29:22.718 --> 06:29:24.150 align:start position:0%
to correct any errors in the existing
appraisal

06:29:24.150 --> 06:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
appraisal
 
06:29:25.350 --> 06:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
06:29:28.070 --> 06:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line three
 
06:29:28.080 --> 06:29:29.270 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line three
um

06:29:29.270 --> 06:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:31.270 --> 06:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
where it says uh shall adjust
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
assessments to reflect changes
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
so changes refers to changes in the
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
property that part is an existing law
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
right now okay
 
06:29:43.430 --> 06:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that didn't need to change okay
 
06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
um if the
 
06:29:45.120 --> 06:29:46.628 align:start position:0%
um if the
assessor

06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
assessor
 
06:29:48.548 --> 06:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
is called out to a particular property
 
06:29:51.750 --> 06:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
because you've added a deck or you have
 
06:29:54.310 --> 06:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
done other improvements to the property
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
those should be reflected on your
 
06:29:59.270 --> 06:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
assessing card and there's people that
 
06:30:01.270 --> 06:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
understand this process a lot more than
 
06:30:02.230 --> 06:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
i do
 
06:30:04.868 --> 06:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
but you add a bedroom
 
06:30:06.708 --> 06:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
you do anything else a lot of those
 
06:30:08.708 --> 06:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
things are caught through the process
 
06:30:10.788 --> 06:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
where you go in for your building permit
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
and the building permit
 
06:30:14.788 --> 06:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
you know causes an inspector to go out
 
06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
and do the various things
 
06:30:17.280 --> 06:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
and do the various things
but

06:30:18.070 --> 06:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:30:20.468 --> 06:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are errors
 
06:30:22.390 --> 06:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
and it could be that somebody read or
 
06:30:24.628 --> 06:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
rule or wrong it could be
 
06:30:24.638 --> 06:30:25.670 align:start position:0%
rule or wrong it could be
whatever

06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
but right now
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we discover that error afterward and
 
06:30:34.150 --> 06:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.990 --> 06:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the taxpayers in that
 
06:30:36.000 --> 06:30:38.230 align:start position:0%
the rest of the taxpayers in that
community

06:30:38.230 --> 06:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:30:39.910 --> 06:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
pay more tax than they should have
 
06:30:39.920 --> 06:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
pay more tax than they should have
because

06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:30:44.390 --> 06:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
whomever's card that error is on is not
 
06:30:44.400 --> 06:30:45.510 align:start position:0%
whomever's card that error is on is not
paying

06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
in a portion you know their appropriate
 
06:30:47.680 --> 06:30:51.270 align:start position:0%
in a portion you know their appropriate
share

06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%

the hearing rather the hearing for
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:58.070 --> 06:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:59.750 --> 06:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
06:32:01.990 --> 06:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
the committee again carol alfano senate
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
communications director it's my
 
06:32:06.868 --> 06:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
privilege to introduce senate bill
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
317 for senator carson
 
06:32:11.670 --> 06:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
while she is not traveling with senator
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
bradley she is also unable to be here
 
06:32:15.590 --> 06:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill reduces the interest rate for
 
06:32:20.788 --> 06:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
abatements of paid property taxes from
 
06:32:23.110 --> 06:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
the current rate of six percent to four
 
06:32:23.120 --> 06:32:24.150 align:start position:0%
the current rate of six percent to four
percent

06:32:24.150 --> 06:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the legislature reduced the late
 
06:32:30.230 --> 06:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
property tax bill interest rate but did
 
06:32:32.868 --> 06:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
not concurrently adjust the tax
 
06:32:35.270 --> 06:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
abatement interest rate this adjustment
 
06:32:38.070 --> 06:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
would save municipalities a small but
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money the
 
06:32:42.230 --> 06:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee amendment clarifies that this
 
06:32:45.350 --> 06:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
change is effective for taxable periods
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
beginning on or after april 1st 2022
 
06:32:53.350 --> 06:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
that concludes my introduction and i
 
06:32:55.270 --> 06:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be happy to
 
06:32:56.948 --> 06:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
send any of your questions along to
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
senator carson are there any uh
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
06:33:07.510 --> 06:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that it's although we
 
06:33:11.350 --> 06:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's a bad word this is a housekeeping
 
06:33:13.110 --> 06:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
06:33:15.670 --> 06:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative i i would defer to
 
06:33:17.670 --> 06:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
senator carson on that i i would not
 
06:33:19.350 --> 06:33:19.360 align:start position:0%

06:33:42.310 --> 06:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
concludes our business for
 
06:33:45.910 --> 06:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 317. oh i'm sorry mr gray's
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
from the nhma
 
06:33:49.510 --> 06:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i skipped you thank you mr
 
06:33:51.830 --> 06:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh i did submit a pink card but i
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
know you have had quite the stack today
 
06:33:56.230 --> 06:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
so it may have gotten lost there
 
06:33:58.468 --> 06:33:58.478 align:start position:0%
nhma nate grace for the new hampshire
 
06:34:00.230 --> 06:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
06:34:02.390 --> 06:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
nhma supports
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 317 it is an hma policy bill
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
it lowers the abatement interest rate
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
from uh six percent to four percent
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so back in 2018 the legislature uh
 
06:34:18.310 --> 06:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
lowered the late property tax bill
 
06:34:20.468 --> 06:34:20.478 align:start position:0%
interest rate um
 
06:34:24.070 --> 06:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
and this is proportional to that um so
 
06:34:24.080 --> 06:34:24.868 align:start position:0%
and this is proportional to that um so
uh

06:34:24.868 --> 06:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:27.430 --> 06:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
in in 2018
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
prior to a tax lien being issued
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
the interest rate was lowered from 12 to
 
06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
8 percent and after the tax lien was
 
06:34:39.750 --> 06:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
issued um it went from 18 to 14
 
06:34:41.830 --> 06:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
but the abatement interest rate was not
 
06:34:43.750 --> 06:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
also lowered so it really is a
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
06:34:47.350 --> 06:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions any questions
 
06:34:50.390 --> 06:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the nhma
 
06:34:51.830 --> 06:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:34:53.590 --> 06:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
you next we're going to hear from
 
06:35:00.310 --> 06:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:01.750 --> 06:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm not an
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
executive counselor i used to be a
 
06:35:06.150 --> 06:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
i can play an executive council okay
 
06:35:11.270 --> 06:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i appreciate the
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
fact that you all stayed but i've been
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and i understand that they lowered
 
06:35:17.430 --> 06:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
the interest rate that they charged
 
06:35:19.350 --> 06:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
people and i thought at that time it was
 
06:35:19.360 --> 06:35:20.310 align:start position:0%
people and i thought at that time it was
wrong

06:35:20.310 --> 06:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
because when a business is short of cash
 
06:35:24.390 --> 06:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
the best place and the easiest place to
 
06:35:27.190 --> 06:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
get it is from the local community
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
and if you can't borrow it for for less
 
06:35:31.590 --> 06:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
than what you're gonna lend it to him
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
then he's going to borrow it from the
 
06:35:35.110 --> 06:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that's the reason why during
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
the tough times we went to 18
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
because the banks were charging 24
 
06:35:39.840 --> 06:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
because the banks were charging 24
percent

06:35:41.030 --> 06:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:35:41.040 --> 06:35:42.468 align:start position:0%
percent
so

06:35:42.468 --> 06:35:42.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:44.788 --> 06:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of people still chose to borrow
 
06:35:46.548 --> 06:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
money from the taxpayer
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a good thing to do and i'm
 
06:35:50.708 --> 06:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised they went that low
 
06:35:50.718 --> 06:35:52.070 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised they went that low
however

06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:35:53.590 --> 06:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
i also
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
fight a lot of tax assessments
 
06:35:58.230 --> 06:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
on properties that i own
 
06:36:01.910 --> 06:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that i'm political
 
06:36:05.270 --> 06:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:07.030 --> 06:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment go up
 
06:36:08.548 --> 06:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
based on what was supposed to be a
 
06:36:10.548 --> 06:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
visual inspection
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
except that when i questioned the person
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
who inspected it and he told me that he
 
06:36:16.868 --> 06:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
had inspected through windows on my deck
 
06:36:18.788 --> 06:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
i knew he was lying because my deck was
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
so rotted a dog's weight wouldn't be
 
06:36:22.230 --> 06:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
held on it
 
06:36:23.750 --> 06:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it went down
 
06:36:26.310 --> 06:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
i've had another issue where
 
06:36:27.670 --> 06:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
an assessor has gone through the
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
driveway handed my son a card and said
 
06:36:32.150 --> 06:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
tell your father his assessment just
 
06:36:33.670 --> 06:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
went up
 
06:36:35.590 --> 06:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's because i speak up at my town
 
06:36:35.600 --> 06:36:37.350 align:start position:0%
it's because i speak up at my town
meetings

06:36:37.350 --> 06:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:36:39.590 --> 06:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
and they don't like it
 
06:36:41.670 --> 06:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
i also have properties in other parts of
 
06:36:44.468 --> 06:36:44.478 align:start position:0%
the state i restore historical
 
06:36:44.478 --> 06:36:45.750 align:start position:0%
the state i restore historical
properties

06:36:45.750 --> 06:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
properties
 
06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
i've appealed to to the borderland and
 
06:36:49.830 --> 06:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
tax appeal
 
06:36:51.590 --> 06:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
and one of both of them
 
06:36:53.590 --> 06:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
problem is it costs money to do an
 
06:36:53.600 --> 06:36:54.868 align:start position:0%
problem is it costs money to do an
appeal

06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
06:36:56.788 --> 06:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
in that time the three years or maybe
 
06:36:58.390 --> 06:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
four years that it takes you to get
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
before the borderland and tax appeal
 
06:37:03.110 --> 06:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
you have to pay somebody to do the work
 
06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're also continuing to pay the same
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
tax bill
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
there should be a penalty
 
06:37:11.670 --> 06:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
all the times that i have won a case it
 
06:37:14.310 --> 06:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't based on the people who sit as
 
06:37:14.320 --> 06:37:15.830 align:start position:0%
wasn't based on the people who sit as
selectmen

06:37:15.830 --> 06:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
06:37:18.230 --> 06:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's based on the the assessment firm
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
that they hire
 
06:37:21.430 --> 06:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
who insist that they don't have to
 
06:37:23.510 --> 06:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
comply with the law
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
i have seen an assessment firm sit there
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
and say
 
06:37:31.030 --> 06:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm taxing every emergency generator
 
06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
because the law tells me i have to
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
yet the law explicitly states
 
06:37:39.750 --> 06:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
an emergency generator is not taxable
 
06:37:41.830 --> 06:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
the same assessment person who works for
 
06:37:43.190 --> 06:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
a large firm
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
said i'm not assessing those people who
 
06:37:47.430 --> 06:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
generate their own power and are off the
 
06:37:47.440 --> 06:37:49.030 align:start position:0%
generate their own power and are off the
grid

06:37:49.030 --> 06:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
grid
 
06:37:51.430 --> 06:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
well the law says you have to
 
06:37:52.948 --> 06:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
even sola
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
i worked for the solar industry for a
 
06:37:57.350 --> 06:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
while and we had to go town to town
 
06:37:59.350 --> 06:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
so that they wouldn't include the solar
 
06:38:01.110 --> 06:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
panels in their assessment at the rate
 
06:38:02.230 --> 06:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
they were
 
06:38:05.110 --> 06:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
because it got so that any any savings
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
they made actually went to the tax
 
06:38:07.120 --> 06:38:08.230 align:start position:0%
they made actually went to the tax
dollars

06:38:08.230 --> 06:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:38:09.910 --> 06:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
but we have people who say i'm not going
 
06:38:11.430 --> 06:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
to assess them because the laws and it's
 
06:38:13.990 --> 06:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:15.990 --> 06:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
in one area where i am
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman who's very high on
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
the political scale who has a house
 
06:38:23.510 --> 06:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful house
 
06:38:26.468 --> 06:38:26.478 align:start position:0%
beautiful barn beautiful garage
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
a hanger for his airplane and an
 
06:38:28.080 --> 06:38:29.910 align:start position:0%
a hanger for his airplane and an
airstrip

06:38:29.910 --> 06:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
airstrip
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
his assessment's 220 thousand dollars
 
06:38:35.510 --> 06:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have a historical house that has no
 
06:38:35.520 --> 06:38:36.868 align:start position:0%
i have a historical house that has no
plumbing

06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
06:38:38.548 --> 06:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
no electricity
 
06:38:40.868 --> 06:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
and it's uninhabitable
 
06:38:43.590 --> 06:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
they assess the 300 000.
 
06:38:45.590 --> 06:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i have to fight it when i go in they
 
06:38:48.868 --> 06:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
tell me oh no we assessed it perfectly
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
and that's not the case
 
06:38:52.230 --> 06:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
so six percent
 
06:38:53.990 --> 06:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
is reasonable because i have to pay
 
06:38:54.000 --> 06:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
is reasonable because i have to pay
people

06:38:55.270 --> 06:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
to keep up i have to pay people to look
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
at the assessments as they change what
 
06:39:00.390 --> 06:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
happens when somebody sells their
 
06:39:03.030 --> 06:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
property and the next guy buys it
 
06:39:05.030 --> 06:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's one case in one community where
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
somebody stated to the court in a
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
divorce case
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
my property's worth 658 thousand dollars
 
06:39:13.910 --> 06:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
06:39:17.030 --> 06:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
yet because he's politically connected
 
06:39:21.350 --> 06:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
he's assessed that i think 265.
 
06:39:23.190 --> 06:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
so these are the things that the regular
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
people have to fight
 
06:39:27.270 --> 06:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of them if you have
 
06:39:30.070 --> 06:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
money if you have political power
 
06:39:31.830 --> 06:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
your assessment's not the same and
 
06:39:33.510 --> 06:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
people have to fight that
 
06:39:35.190 --> 06:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if you're not on the
 
06:39:37.670 --> 06:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
wrong side of the political power
 
06:39:39.430 --> 06:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
you pay dearly
 
06:39:42.390 --> 06:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
this should be this is a penalty
 
06:39:44.548 --> 06:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's not about i invested my money with
 
06:39:46.310 --> 06:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
you for four percent
 
06:39:47.750 --> 06:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's about you shouldn't have taken my
 
06:39:50.310 --> 06:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
money to begin with and you knew it
 
06:39:52.390 --> 06:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
now if you want to if you want to make
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
it so that the city's in town save some
 
06:39:54.080 --> 06:39:55.030 align:start position:0%
it so that the city's in town save some
money

06:39:55.030 --> 06:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:39:57.190 --> 06:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
put in the law that the assessment
 
06:39:59.910 --> 06:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
firm has to pay it
 
06:40:01.670 --> 06:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe then they'll actually follow
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
the law and they'll stop being
 
06:40:05.590 --> 06:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
politically influenced and do the right
 
06:40:05.600 --> 06:40:06.628 align:start position:0%
politically influenced and do the right
thing

06:40:06.628 --> 06:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:40:08.948 --> 06:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
but to reduce this to four percent
 
06:40:11.670 --> 06:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
means every time i go fight a town i'm
 
06:40:13.510 --> 06:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to take more money out of my
 
06:40:13.520 --> 06:40:14.708 align:start position:0%
going to take more money out of my
pocket

06:40:14.708 --> 06:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
06:40:16.150 --> 06:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
to fight them and i'm going to come out
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
the loser
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
so all they have to do is smile and say
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah you sort of won but but we beat you
 
06:40:26.150 --> 06:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking you not to do it and by
 
06:40:27.670 --> 06:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
the way my town assessor's behind me and
 
06:40:29.430 --> 06:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think he wants to speak but
 
06:40:31.350 --> 06:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
he's my friend
 
06:40:33.030 --> 06:40:33.040 align:start position:0%

06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts
 
06:40:47.670 --> 06:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
involved in some of the cases you're
 
06:40:50.070 --> 06:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about in your testimony and i
 
06:40:51.990 --> 06:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
kind of missed those could you
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
like one of them was what six hundred
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars could you repeat some
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
of those for me
 
06:41:00.468 --> 06:41:00.478 align:start position:0%

case

06:41:01.510 --> 06:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
trying to show that his property wasn't
 
06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
worth much told the judge it was worth
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
658 thousand dollars because he didn't
 
06:41:08.708 --> 06:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
want to give his wife
 
06:41:10.390 --> 06:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
what it was really worth
 
06:41:12.310 --> 06:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
and and he was only taxed in that
 
06:41:17.190 --> 06:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
community for i believe it was 265 000.

the town of hudson uh the hudson board
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
of selectmen uh voted to uh have uh
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
either medium of the town administrator
 
06:42:06.070 --> 06:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
up here to support this bill
 
06:42:08.390 --> 06:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:42:10.868 --> 06:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
many of you serve uh at your local level
 
06:42:12.628 --> 06:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
on boards of slackmen and town councils
 
06:42:13.910 --> 06:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you know that you have to raise an
 
06:42:15.990 --> 06:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
abatement overlay fund
 
06:42:18.708 --> 06:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
and that's the cover abatements um at
 
06:42:20.788 --> 06:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
the end of uh the last paragraph and the
 
06:42:23.110 --> 06:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
letter that's being handed out um by
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
lowering the interest amount
 
06:42:26.948 --> 06:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
we'll have the net effect
 
06:42:29.110 --> 06:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
of serving to lower the amount of the
 
06:42:31.590 --> 06:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
abatement overlay the abatement overlay
 
06:42:33.430 --> 06:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
gets raised by taxes
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
so in essence
 
06:42:36.948 --> 06:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
by having less interest paid out that
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
abatement overlay fund can be reduced
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
um or at least
 
06:42:43.350 --> 06:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
lessened the increase would be lessened
 
06:42:46.868 --> 06:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
um and i agree with nhma on the changes
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
that were made when the interest rates
 
06:42:50.230 --> 06:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
for late payments and this one going
 
06:42:52.788 --> 06:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
down from six percent to four percent um
 
06:42:54.948 --> 06:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
seems to be aligned with that
 
06:42:54.958 --> 06:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
seems to be aligned with that
and

06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is the uh that is the balance of my
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
testimony for today well thank you thank
 
06:43:01.990 --> 06:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
you for being brief any questions
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:10.230 --> 06:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:11.750 --> 06:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that concludes
 
06:43:14.868 --> 06:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
06:43:14.878 --> 06:43:16.310 align:start position:0%
a hearing
for

06:43:16.310 --> 06:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:43:17.590 --> 06:43:17.600 align:start position:0%

speed 29 will establish a commission to
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
study the declining
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
availability of housing
 
06:44:51.030 --> 06:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
and will also provide us with an
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to study what the various
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
barriers may be including access to
 
06:44:59.190 --> 06:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
federal resources which we may have
 
06:45:01.190 --> 06:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
housing is a critical issue facing our
 
06:45:03.590 --> 06:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
state and our region the commission will
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
give us another venue to look at the
 
06:45:07.350 --> 06:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
tools at our disposal to address the
 
06:45:09.590 --> 06:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and to see how best to
 
06:45:12.310 --> 06:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
deploy them going forward
 
06:45:15.270 --> 06:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate sb 329 now also
 
06:45:17.590 --> 06:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
includes a workforce housing developer a
 
06:45:20.548 --> 06:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
representative of the bia to ensure that
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
a holistic review of the housing
 
06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
situation is taken
 
06:45:26.708 --> 06:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
i am also proposing amendment
 
06:45:31.270 --> 06:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
1072 s which i just circulated
 
06:45:31.280 --> 06:45:32.708 align:start position:0%
1072 s which i just circulated
which

06:45:32.708 --> 06:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
was emailed to the committee by may 8 on
 
06:45:35.830 --> 06:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
march 29th
 
06:45:38.150 --> 06:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
so you guys might have an old copy which
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
will add a representative of the office
 
06:45:41.270 --> 06:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
of planning and development in the
 
06:45:42.788 --> 06:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
06:45:45.750 --> 06:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
affairs to the commission
 
06:45:48.150 --> 06:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
sb 329 passed the senate health and
 
06:45:50.548 --> 06:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
human services committee for nothing and
 
06:45:54.070 --> 06:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
passed the full senate on a voice vote
 
06:45:57.590 --> 06:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier this morning i am
 
06:46:00.150 --> 06:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
a long time advocate of affordable and
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
workforce housing
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think it is something that we just
 
06:46:06.390 --> 06:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
need to continue to work on and work on
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
and work on and
 
06:46:10.708 --> 06:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
i know that we have a hearing coming up
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
shortly for sb 400 but
 
06:46:15.270 --> 06:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
view this commission as an opportunity
 
06:46:17.110 --> 06:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
to look ahead
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and see what else we can do
 
06:46:22.468 --> 06:46:22.478 align:start position:0%
yes representative vann
 
06:46:24.868 --> 06:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you senator
 
06:46:24.878 --> 06:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you senator
uh

06:46:25.670 --> 06:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
so it says middle-income housing do we
 
06:46:32.070 --> 06:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have a definition of that and
 
06:46:36.070 --> 06:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
we might need one for the commission but
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
the idea is to make sure that we're
 
06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
keeping our workforce healthy and strong
 
06:46:42.558 --> 06:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
keeping our workforce healthy and strong
so

06:46:43.510 --> 06:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:46.230 --> 06:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the those that are housing
 
06:46:48.868 --> 06:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
challenged keeps expanding and in our
 
06:46:48.878 --> 06:46:49.750 align:start position:0%
challenged keeps expanding and in our
case

06:46:49.750 --> 06:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:46:51.030 --> 06:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
this would of course include our
 
06:46:52.788 --> 06:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
firefighters our police officers our
 
06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
teachers but increasingly would
 
06:46:58.310 --> 06:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
encompass young engineers accountants
 
06:46:59.510 --> 06:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and lawyers
 
06:47:01.590 --> 06:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
anyone who has to afford a home on their
 
06:47:01.600 --> 06:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
anyone who has to afford a home on their
own

06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
and even families are very much
 
06:47:08.468 --> 06:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
struggling to find houses they can
 
06:47:08.478 --> 06:47:09.350 align:start position:0%
struggling to find houses they can
afford

06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
afford
 
06:47:11.670 --> 06:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
06:47:13.430 --> 06:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
so you're really talking about the
 
06:47:16.788 --> 06:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
reason i ask is i have seen recently
 
06:47:18.868 --> 06:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
that there's a conflation of missing
 
06:47:21.430 --> 06:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
middle and middle income and i just
 
06:47:23.350 --> 06:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that was not
 
06:47:25.990 --> 06:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
happening here because missing middle is
 
06:47:29.590 --> 06:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
a building type middle income is a money
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
so it really is you're really talking
 
06:47:33.510 --> 06:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
about money and income here
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's right representative thank you
 
06:47:37.030 --> 06:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the clarifications
 
06:47:40.070 --> 06:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
06:47:41.590 --> 06:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you senator for
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question as a freshman state
 
06:47:43.680 --> 06:47:45.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question as a freshman state
representative

06:47:45.030 --> 06:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:47:45.040 --> 06:47:46.070 align:start position:0%
representative
um

06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:48.230 --> 06:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm new to
 
06:47:52.310 --> 06:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
to to concord and so my question is
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other studies or
 
06:47:56.150 --> 06:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
commissions that have been
 
06:47:58.230 --> 06:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
conducted to study the issue of
 
06:48:01.190 --> 06:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
workforce housing from
 
06:48:03.590 --> 06:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct i believe that there was
 
06:48:07.350 --> 06:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
one that resulted in 2021 house bill
 
06:48:07.360 --> 06:48:08.868 align:start position:0%
one that resulted in 2021 house bill
5

06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
5
 
06:48:08.878 --> 06:48:10.548 align:start position:0%
5
86.

06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
86.
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:48:14.548 --> 06:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
is this another study to study the same
 
06:48:16.468 --> 06:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
thing that's already been studied and
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
how might this be different than others
 
06:48:22.868 --> 06:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question so um
 
06:48:24.788 --> 06:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
there were two efforts probably in the
 
06:48:26.548 --> 06:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
06:48:31.110 --> 06:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
to look at housing one was a commission
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
that my predecessor senator martha
 
06:48:34.070 --> 06:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
fuller clark
 
06:48:35.510 --> 06:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward which was a commission
 
06:48:38.628 --> 06:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
to study barriers on density um
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
06:48:42.390 --> 06:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
was not able to fully finish its work
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic and so there are
 
06:48:49.030 --> 06:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
some aspects of its charge that
 
06:48:51.110 --> 06:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
are being proposed to be picked up by
 
06:48:53.430 --> 06:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
this commission um so it's it's a
 
06:48:55.670 --> 06:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
continuation in that way however
 
06:48:55.680 --> 06:48:56.708 align:start position:0%
continuation in that way however
um

06:48:56.708 --> 06:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then there was also another uh
 
06:49:01.190 --> 06:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
task force essentially out of the
 
06:49:03.750 --> 06:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office that i participated in
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
that resulted in hb
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
586 which in the previous year was
 
06:49:11.350 --> 06:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
hb 16 29 and 32
 
06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
and is now back as sb400
 
06:49:14.400 --> 06:49:15.110 align:start position:0%
and is now back as sb400
so

06:49:15.110 --> 06:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:49:16.708 --> 06:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
those efforts have both been undertaken
 
06:49:18.468 --> 06:49:18.478 align:start position:0%
in the past few years but
 
06:49:20.310 --> 06:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm aware at this time there's
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
nothing else proposed to be going
 
06:49:21.840 --> 06:49:23.590 align:start position:0%
nothing else proposed to be going
forward

06:49:23.590 --> 06:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:49:25.910 --> 06:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
06:49:28.548 --> 06:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
yes in that same regard do you know
 
06:49:31.190 --> 06:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
if the governor's task force is an
 
06:49:31.200 --> 06:49:32.708 align:start position:0%
if the governor's task force is an
ongoing

06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
operation or is this going to be
 
06:49:34.798 --> 06:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
operation or is this going to be
parallel

06:49:35.910 --> 06:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
06:49:35.920 --> 06:49:36.708 align:start position:0%
parallel
or

06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:49:39.350 --> 06:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
to take the place of the task force
 
06:49:41.270 --> 06:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
i i do know the answer to that question
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
i participated in the governor's task
 
06:49:44.230 --> 06:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
force and it
 
06:49:47.750 --> 06:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
was a 90-day charge so it was short and
 
06:49:49.350 --> 06:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
this one would be the only one that
 
06:49:50.868 --> 06:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
exists at the time
 
06:49:52.628 --> 06:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your answer
 
06:49:55.750 --> 06:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:55.760 --> 06:49:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:49:57.190 --> 06:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative already
 
06:50:02.948 --> 06:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.468 --> 06:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
this is my first year on municipal
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
county and government but
 
06:50:13.590 --> 06:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
what has come to my attention from the
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
bills that have come before us is that
 
06:50:18.548 --> 06:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
there are many barriers that
 
06:50:20.390 --> 06:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
are created at the local level
 
06:50:24.070 --> 06:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
particularly with local planning boards
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
i was wondering why there wasn't someone
 
06:50:28.548 --> 06:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
from there on represented on this
 
06:50:28.558 --> 06:50:31.270 align:start position:0%
from there on represented on this
commission

06:50:31.270 --> 06:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:32.390 --> 06:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
sorry representative could you just
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
clarify someone from for example new
 
06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
i'm really thinking of people that are
 
06:50:40.468 --> 06:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
really at the front lines of
 
06:50:42.548 --> 06:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
of approving these kind of houses so it
 
06:50:45.270 --> 06:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
would be a representative from a
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
municipal planning board
 
06:50:48.718 --> 06:50:49.670 align:start position:0%
municipal planning board
um

06:50:49.670 --> 06:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:52.310 --> 06:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i would certainly
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
be open to adding such a member
 
06:50:57.270 --> 06:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
06:51:00.230 --> 06:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
my short answer is that as you say
 
06:51:02.708 --> 06:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
they're on the front lines and so i view
 
06:51:04.948 --> 06:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
this as a way to
 
06:51:07.190 --> 06:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
allow those at the state level to to
 
06:51:09.110 --> 06:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
think and provide tools to support them
 
06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
in their work not necessarily ask
 
06:51:14.070 --> 06:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
more of them but it's certainly
 
06:51:17.110 --> 06:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
an expertise that would be welcome and
 
06:51:19.030 --> 06:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
as a former city councilor and planning
 
06:51:22.230 --> 06:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
board member i know that um
 
06:51:25.190 --> 06:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that sort of we're
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
all working on it on different levels i
 
06:51:29.910 --> 06:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
think is very important and
 
06:51:31.350 --> 06:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
supportive to the cause so if that's
 
06:51:32.548 --> 06:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
something you'd like to discuss further
 
06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm more than happy to do that and then
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh one follow-up
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and then uh just another
 
06:51:37.280 --> 06:51:38.708 align:start position:0%
thank you and then uh just another
suggestion

06:51:38.708 --> 06:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
06:51:40.948 --> 06:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
is um perhaps the
 
06:51:42.948 --> 06:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
this the the member of the house of
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
representatives could be um specified
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be someone who sits on
 
06:51:49.510 --> 06:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay i like both of those changes thank
 
06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%

this commission
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
um would it be appropriate to have
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
someone from the new hampshire planning
 
06:52:11.360 --> 06:52:12.708 align:start position:0%

an amendment in front of you 1072 which
 
06:52:26.070 --> 06:52:26.080 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:52:45.670 --> 06:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement
 
06:52:47.270 --> 06:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
we see these
 
06:52:50.868 --> 06:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees come and go
 
06:52:52.868 --> 06:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
we know that there have been
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
06:52:57.670 --> 06:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
has been a need for for
 
06:53:00.070 --> 06:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
decades probably
 
06:53:02.948 --> 06:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
we said that the governor had a had a
 
06:53:04.948 --> 06:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
90-day commission
 
06:53:08.628 --> 06:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement for these
 
06:53:10.788 --> 06:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions
 
06:53:13.110 --> 06:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
to produce a report
 
06:53:14.830 --> 06:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
so that the next
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
rendition of this
 
06:53:17.440 --> 06:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
rendition of this
study

06:53:19.030 --> 06:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
study
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to start from zero previous
 
06:53:22.080 --> 06:53:23.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to start from zero previous
reports

06:53:23.670 --> 06:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
reports
 
06:53:28.628 --> 06:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
as a basis foundation for going forward
 
06:53:29.750 --> 06:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:53:32.468 --> 06:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
representative and um in this particular
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
bill there there is a requirement to
 
06:53:37.350 --> 06:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
report out it's found on um
 
06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
lines 28 through 30 of page one so that
 
06:53:42.070 --> 06:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be a report
 
06:53:44.708 --> 06:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
by november 1st of this year um
 
06:53:47.510 --> 06:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i can also assure you on this issue
 
06:53:49.590 --> 06:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to use the word us those
 
06:53:53.510 --> 06:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
of us that are in the housing advocate
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
community um
 
06:53:57.510 --> 06:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know are very much aware of the work
 
06:53:59.510 --> 06:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has been done what we're building
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
on and sort of where we go from here i
 
06:54:04.070 --> 06:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
know the council for housing stability
 
06:54:05.190 --> 06:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
has been
 
06:54:08.788 --> 06:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
a convening ground for sort of
 
06:54:10.468 --> 06:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
many different aspects of the housing
 
06:54:14.070 --> 06:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
crisis and so that strategic report has
 
06:54:15.670 --> 06:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
some action items that have been
 
06:54:18.868 --> 06:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
implemented this year and um again you
 
06:54:20.948 --> 06:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
know just me being here asking for this
 
06:54:23.350 --> 06:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
commission is sort of an outcome of the
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
previous commission having a couple
 
06:54:28.310 --> 06:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
pieces of its charge in its final report
 
06:54:31.830 --> 06:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't able to complete so
 
06:54:33.430 --> 06:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
even though it's not in the bill
 
06:54:35.350 --> 06:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
we very much intend to build on the
 
06:54:38.070 --> 06:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
previous work done
 
06:54:39.270 --> 06:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:54:41.350 --> 06:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
06:54:45.350 --> 06:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:47.590 --> 06:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written it anticipates
 
06:54:49.270 --> 06:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
the committee finishing its work in
 
06:54:52.230 --> 06:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
november of 2022 which seems like a
 
06:54:54.948 --> 06:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
really tight timetable to me
 
06:54:57.030 --> 06:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if that
 
06:54:57.040 --> 06:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if that
seems

06:54:57.990 --> 06:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
seems
 
06:55:01.590 --> 06:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's also
 
06:55:06.070 --> 06:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
a fair question i think that's a fairly
 
06:55:09.990 --> 06:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
standard date to report out and
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
the re-standard date to report out and
 
06:55:16.390 --> 06:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
the reason being that you know in
 
06:55:19.350 --> 06:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
election years our legislative deadlines
 
06:55:20.948 --> 06:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
for the house and the senate occur at
 
06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the year so i think the
 
06:55:25.590 --> 06:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
06:55:27.510 --> 06:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can act on those
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations and file any needed
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation but
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know i'd certainly be open to that
 
06:55:35.430 --> 06:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
being an interim report and the ability
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
for us to continue our work
 
06:55:39.990 --> 06:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up just a quick follow-up
 
06:55:41.190 --> 06:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
i wonder if
 
06:55:43.990 --> 06:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
some language might be added that would
 
06:55:45.830 --> 06:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
carry the commission's work forward
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
should it not be completed by november
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
20 22 so you won't lose the momentum
 
06:55:56.868 --> 06:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:58.948 --> 06:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
and any other
 
06:55:58.958 --> 06:56:00.230 align:start position:0%
and any other
questions

06:56:00.230 --> 06:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the senator
 
06:56:05.030 --> 06:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you very much
 
06:56:08.390 --> 06:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
senator thank you chair thank you
 
06:56:11.030 --> 06:56:11.040 align:start position:0%

06:56:30.230 --> 06:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon in support of this bill for
 
06:56:32.310 --> 06:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
the record my name is dave juve i'm a
 
06:56:34.548 --> 06:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
senior vice president for public policy
 
06:56:36.150 --> 06:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
06:56:36.160 --> 06:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
association

06:56:37.670 --> 06:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:56:39.750 --> 06:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
i've been before this committee before
 
06:56:43.190 --> 06:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
but not often so i would like to tell
 
06:56:44.628 --> 06:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
you first of all a little bit about the
 
06:56:47.350 --> 06:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
bia we serve as new hampshire statewide
 
06:56:49.990 --> 06:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce we have about 400
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
employer members
 
06:56:55.030 --> 06:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
with over 90 000 employees in the state
 
06:56:57.190 --> 06:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i want to focus on those 90 000
 
06:56:59.190 --> 06:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
employees because every single one of
 
06:57:01.270 --> 06:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
them needs a place to live hopefully
 
06:57:03.910 --> 06:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
they do but we know many others are
 
06:57:06.628 --> 06:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
having a hard time finding affordable
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
housing either rental housing or
 
06:57:10.628 --> 06:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
or what
 
06:57:12.468 --> 06:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
in my generation we used to call starter
 
06:57:12.478 --> 06:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
in my generation we used to call starter
homes

06:57:13.800 --> 06:57:13.810 align:start position:0%
homes
 
06:57:13.810 --> 06:57:15.190 align:start position:0%
homes
[Music]

06:57:15.190 --> 06:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of you have asked questions about
 
06:57:19.350 --> 06:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know we've had commissions do we
 
06:57:21.910 --> 06:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
need another one and my response to that
 
06:57:24.868 --> 06:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
is things are always changing
 
06:57:26.510 --> 06:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:57:29.430 --> 06:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
considerations now obstacles if you will
 
06:57:31.750 --> 06:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
to being able to develop affordable
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
housing that we didn't think about five
 
06:57:36.310 --> 06:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
years ago um
 
06:57:38.230 --> 06:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
retaliatory tariffs on building
 
06:57:40.468 --> 06:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
materials inflation
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh just to name a few um some things
 
06:57:44.878 --> 06:57:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh just to name a few um some things
um

06:57:45.750 --> 06:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
continue on such as um you know concern
 
06:57:51.030 --> 06:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
from some municipalities about ruining
 
06:57:53.670 --> 06:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the nature of their cities and towns
 
06:57:56.310 --> 06:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
but uh there is a lot of new information
 
06:57:58.948 --> 06:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
for a commission to do and and i would
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
by the way support that recommendation
 
06:58:04.628 --> 06:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
to extend this beyond november of of
 
06:58:07.670 --> 06:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
2022. i think the november date is
 
06:58:09.670 --> 06:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to have an interim
 
06:58:11.910 --> 06:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
report in case there is some legislation
 
06:58:13.830 --> 06:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
to be filed for next year
 
06:58:13.840 --> 06:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
to be filed for next year
but

06:58:15.590 --> 06:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:58:17.670 --> 06:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated issue
 
06:58:20.468 --> 06:58:20.478 align:start position:0%
there are many things that impact the
 
06:58:23.350 --> 06:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
ability to to build
 
06:58:25.510 --> 06:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state and i
 
06:58:28.230 --> 06:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
would uh support efforts to to extend
 
06:58:30.310 --> 06:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
the life of this commission beyond the
 
06:58:32.310 --> 06:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
end of this year mr chairman that
 
06:58:33.990 --> 06:58:34.000 align:start position:0%

try and answer any questions any
questions

06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:58:38.628 --> 06:58:38.638 align:start position:0%

we thank senator perkins cuoco for
 
06:59:18.948 --> 06:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
introducing the study commission i've
 
06:59:20.548 --> 06:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
been in this role as director since
 
06:59:20.558 --> 06:59:22.070 align:start position:0%
been in this role as director since
2009.

06:59:22.070 --> 06:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
2009.
 
06:59:24.230 --> 06:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that a little over 10
 
06:59:26.948 --> 06:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
years ago senator bob odell had chaired
 
06:59:28.948 --> 06:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
a commission on housing
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:59:32.310 --> 06:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
and we thought that
 
06:59:32.320 --> 06:59:33.350 align:start position:0%
and we thought that
the

06:59:33.350 --> 06:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:59:35.590 --> 06:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
the the shortage of the housing supply
 
06:59:38.070 --> 06:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
was of a concern then it's certainly in
 
06:59:42.230 --> 06:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
a crisis space right now but we have an
 
06:59:44.708 --> 06:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
unprecedented resource opportunity with
 
06:59:47.350 --> 06:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
the federal resources in play some
 
06:59:49.190 --> 06:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
investments that the legislature has
 
06:59:51.110 --> 06:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
made into our affordable housing fund
 
06:59:54.868 --> 06:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
and it's it's the reports generated by
 
06:59:57.510 --> 06:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
these commissions have been very helpful
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
um not only in
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
policy development but in understanding
 
07:00:01.440 --> 07:00:02.390 align:start position:0%
policy development but in understanding
compromise

07:00:02.390 --> 07:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
07:00:04.708 --> 07:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and making some progress
 
07:00:07.590 --> 07:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the policy realm so we would welcome
 
07:00:09.830 --> 07:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
um another commission on housing at this
 
07:00:12.468 --> 07:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
time especially focused uh uh on the
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
problems of today
 
07:00:19.830 --> 07:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.190 --> 07:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
wrong yes
 
07:00:22.628 --> 07:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:00:24.150 --> 07:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:00:26.150 --> 07:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned a previous commission
 
07:00:28.628 --> 07:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
07:00:29.910 --> 07:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then you brought up how things have
 
07:00:31.750 --> 07:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
changed because there's more resources
 
07:00:35.350 --> 07:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
becoming available so was the um outcome
 
07:00:37.910 --> 07:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the previous commission solely on the
 
07:00:42.070 --> 07:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
cost basis of funding for housing my
 
07:00:43.510 --> 07:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
recollection of that report and it's a
 
07:00:45.430 --> 07:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
while ago was that the recommendation
 
07:00:47.030 --> 07:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
was that the state
 
07:00:49.190 --> 07:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
start um
 
07:00:50.948 --> 07:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
regularly funding our state housing
 
07:00:53.190 --> 07:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the time
 
07:00:54.868 --> 07:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
there was an analysis and we realized
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire was one of four
 
07:00:57.670 --> 07:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
states that didn't have a dedicated
 
07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
funding source for our revolving loan
 
07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
fund that provides below market rate
 
07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
capital so you can
 
07:01:06.150 --> 07:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know pass it along to developers in
 
07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
those savings go to residents
 
07:01:11.510 --> 07:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
we thankfully we changed that and now we
 
07:01:13.190 --> 07:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated funding source and we
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
have increased investments in the
 
07:01:17.190 --> 07:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
state's affordable housing fund i also
 
07:01:20.150 --> 07:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
remember and um perhaps um
 
07:01:22.628 --> 07:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
others who served on that commission
 
07:01:24.390 --> 07:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
something about the alteration of
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
terrain i couldn't give you the the
 
07:01:28.548 --> 07:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
details on it but it was very specific
 
07:01:30.150 --> 07:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
at the time and then
 
07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
um the conversations that happened at
 
07:01:34.230 --> 07:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
that time between
 
07:01:36.468 --> 07:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
developers and
 
07:01:36.478 --> 07:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
developers and
um

07:01:38.230 --> 07:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:40.548 --> 07:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
safety officials um
 
07:01:42.468 --> 07:01:42.478 align:start position:0%
was a good start of a conversation and
 
07:01:43.830 --> 07:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
since then there's actually been a
 
07:01:46.150 --> 07:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
conference when building uh building and
 
07:01:48.788 --> 07:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
safety officials together to talk about
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know streamlining things so we have
 
07:01:52.150 --> 07:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
found these legislative study
 
07:01:55.750 --> 07:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
commissions to be to be helpful
 
07:01:58.628 --> 07:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:02:00.150 --> 07:02:00.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman members of the
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is jack ruderman and i
 
07:02:20.150 --> 07:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
serve as the manager for public affairs
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire housing i'm here to
 
07:02:26.468 --> 07:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
testify today in support of sb 329
 
07:02:28.150 --> 07:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that it is important to
 
07:02:29.830 --> 07:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
establish this study commission for
 
07:02:31.910 --> 07:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
primarily two reasons
 
07:02:34.150 --> 07:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
first new hampshire is continuing to
 
07:02:35.910 --> 07:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
experience what governor sununu has
 
07:02:38.468 --> 07:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
described as a housing crisis
 
07:02:40.468 --> 07:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
and i apologize if i'm preaching to the
 
07:02:42.310 --> 07:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
choir here but i did want to cite a few
 
07:02:42.320 --> 07:02:43.990 align:start position:0%
choir here but i did want to cite a few
statistics

07:02:43.990 --> 07:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that really paint the picture of of
 
07:02:45.920 --> 07:02:46.628 align:start position:0%
that that really paint the picture of of
the

07:02:46.628 --> 07:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:02:49.110 --> 07:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
nature of the housing crisis so
 
07:02:51.190 --> 07:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
just to cite a few the vacancy rate for
 
07:02:53.430 --> 07:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
apartments right now is at an historic
 
07:02:55.910 --> 07:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
low of less than one percent roughly
 
07:02:57.510 --> 07:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
point six percent
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
meaning there are very few apartments on
 
07:03:01.670 --> 07:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
the market and they are extremely hard
 
07:03:02.948 --> 07:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
to come by
 
07:03:04.948 --> 07:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
a normal healthy vacancy rate is
 
07:03:08.150 --> 07:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
considered to be a roughly five percent
 
07:03:09.990 --> 07:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
apartment rental costs have increased
 
07:03:12.628 --> 07:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
steadily in recent years the median
 
07:03:14.468 --> 07:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
gross rental rate for a two bedroom
 
07:03:16.708 --> 07:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
apartment as of a year ago was fifteen
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars over five years the
 
07:03:20.708 --> 07:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
price of a two bedroom apartment has
 
07:03:23.510 --> 07:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
risen nearly twenty five percent
 
07:03:23.520 --> 07:03:24.628 align:start position:0%
risen nearly twenty five percent
meanwhile

07:03:24.628 --> 07:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
meanwhile
 
07:03:27.430 --> 07:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
home prices are skyrocketing the median
 
07:03:29.670 --> 07:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
sales price for a single family home has
 
07:03:32.310 --> 07:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
risen from and seventy thousand dollars
 
07:03:33.830 --> 07:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
07:03:35.590 --> 07:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
to four hundred and five thousand in
 
07:03:37.510 --> 07:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
february of this year
 
07:03:39.830 --> 07:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
an increase of fifty percent
 
07:03:41.830 --> 07:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
and in rockingham county the median
 
07:03:45.670 --> 07:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
sales price is now an astronomical 550
 
07:03:45.680 --> 07:03:47.190 align:start position:0%
sales price is now an astronomical 550
000

07:03:47.190 --> 07:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
000
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the inventory of single-family
 
07:03:51.910 --> 07:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
homes statewide has plunged from 3 500
 
07:03:54.708 --> 07:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
homes in february of 2019
 
07:03:58.310 --> 07:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
to just 928 homes this past february
 
07:04:01.110 --> 07:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
a decrease of 74 percent
 
07:04:02.468 --> 07:04:02.478 align:start position:0%
so we've got
 
07:04:06.070 --> 07:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
a twin crisis here of both a shortage
 
07:04:07.270 --> 07:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
of supply
 
07:04:10.868 --> 07:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh and unaffordable prices
 
07:04:14.548 --> 07:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
what all these statistics translate to
 
07:04:16.548 --> 07:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
is an economy in which homelessness is
 
07:04:16.558 --> 07:04:17.910 align:start position:0%
is an economy in which homelessness is
increasing

07:04:17.910 --> 07:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
07:04:20.310 --> 07:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
families can't afford to buy homes
 
07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
young people are hesitant to settle or
 
07:04:24.468 --> 07:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire
 
07:04:26.230 --> 07:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
and employers can't hire the workers
 
07:04:29.590 --> 07:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
they need to grow their businesses
 
07:04:31.270 --> 07:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the second reason we support creating
 
07:04:33.190 --> 07:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
the study commission is that the work of
 
07:04:35.670 --> 07:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
the prior study commission which other
 
07:04:39.030 --> 07:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
speakers today have referred to
 
07:04:41.190 --> 07:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
was only partly completed due to the
 
07:04:44.070 --> 07:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic the commission
 
07:04:46.628 --> 07:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
did not meet for a period of roughly six
 
07:04:49.030 --> 07:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
months in 2020
 
07:04:50.788 --> 07:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
as a result there wasn't enough time to
 
07:04:53.110 --> 07:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
investigate several important topics for
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
instance the commission was unable to
 
07:04:57.190 --> 07:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
explore possible methods of increasing
 
07:04:59.990 --> 07:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
the supply of of workforce housing
 
07:05:04.708 --> 07:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:06.230 --> 07:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that it is important to
 
07:05:07.750 --> 07:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
complete the work of the prior study
 
07:05:09.190 --> 07:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
committee and for new hampshire to
 
07:05:11.270 --> 07:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
continue in its efforts to explore all
 
07:05:12.708 --> 07:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
potential measures
 
07:05:14.468 --> 07:05:14.478 align:start position:0%
to help resolve the state's housing
 
07:05:14.478 --> 07:05:15.750 align:start position:0%
to help resolve the state's housing
crisis

07:05:15.750 --> 07:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
07:05:17.670 --> 07:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony i'll be
 
07:05:19.350 --> 07:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
07:05:22.548 --> 07:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
for your time from the committee
 
07:05:25.270 --> 07:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp
 
07:05:26.708 --> 07:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:05:29.430 --> 07:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
07:05:31.750 --> 07:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there was a 74
 
07:05:33.590 --> 07:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
07:05:35.750 --> 07:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
housing availability
 
07:05:35.760 --> 07:05:36.948 align:start position:0%
housing availability
uh

07:05:36.948 --> 07:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:05:40.070 --> 07:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
would you consider that to be a result
 
07:05:41.430 --> 07:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
07:05:43.990 --> 07:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
coveted refugees immigrating from the
 
07:05:47.190 --> 07:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:48.948 --> 07:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
well it's a great question but i think
 
07:05:51.670 --> 07:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
that goes to demand for housing whereas
 
07:05:54.948 --> 07:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
the the supply i think is is an entirely
 
07:05:58.150 --> 07:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
different matter that has to do with
 
07:06:01.430 --> 07:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
a multitude of factors from people aging
 
07:06:02.548 --> 07:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
in place
 
07:06:05.510 --> 07:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
to people being unafford people being
 
07:06:07.910 --> 07:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
unable to afford
 
07:06:09.430 --> 07:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
moving to new homes you know for
 
07:06:11.350 --> 07:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
instance folks who are in their
 
07:06:14.788 --> 07:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
retirement years who want to downsize
 
07:06:16.788 --> 07:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's just not a lot of turnover in
 
07:06:18.390 --> 07:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
the market right now and not a lot of
 
07:06:21.990 --> 07:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
housing stock that is on the market
 
07:06:25.110 --> 07:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:27.590 --> 07:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis thank you mr
 
07:06:28.868 --> 07:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
07:06:30.310 --> 07:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
question and i don't know if it's a
 
07:06:32.230 --> 07:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
question you can answer
 
07:06:35.910 --> 07:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe someone can um
 
07:06:38.070 --> 07:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
i represent lebanon
 
07:06:40.150 --> 07:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
which is as you know right on the border
 
07:06:41.510 --> 07:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
with vermont
 
07:06:43.270 --> 07:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:06:45.430 --> 07:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
we together with hartford vermont have
 
07:06:48.070 --> 07:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much absorbed most of the
 
07:06:50.548 --> 07:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
increased density in housing in the
 
07:06:52.230 --> 07:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
upper valley region
 
07:06:55.830 --> 07:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if the commission can
 
07:06:55.840 --> 07:06:57.910 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if the commission can
somehow

07:06:57.910 --> 07:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
07:07:01.750 --> 07:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
discuss or take on the issue of
 
07:07:01.760 --> 07:07:03.590 align:start position:0%
discuss or take on the issue of
inter-community

07:07:03.590 --> 07:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
inter-community
 
07:07:06.548 --> 07:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
maybe bi-state solutions
 
07:07:08.390 --> 07:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
to some of these problems because we
 
07:07:10.468 --> 07:07:10.478 align:start position:0%
don't exist in isolation and many of the
 
07:07:12.788 --> 07:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
people who live in lebanon and
 
07:07:15.270 --> 07:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
towns to the east of lebanon regularly
 
07:07:17.590 --> 07:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
commute into vermont and vice versa and
 
07:07:18.868 --> 07:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
the same is true of maine and
 
07:07:18.878 --> 07:07:20.868 align:start position:0%
the same is true of maine and
massachusetts

07:07:20.868 --> 07:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
07:07:22.070 --> 07:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
07:07:24.150 --> 07:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly good question and i would
 
07:07:25.670 --> 07:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
expect that the committee would be able
 
07:07:27.110 --> 07:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
to or the commission would be able to
 
07:07:28.628 --> 07:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
look at some of these issues in a
 
07:07:31.510 --> 07:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
regional context and not just limited to
 
07:07:32.868 --> 07:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
our own borders
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i think it's an excellent suggestion
 
07:07:37.110 --> 07:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:07:38.390 --> 07:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
07:07:43.110 --> 07:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:46.150 --> 07:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that's going to conclude our
 
07:07:49.350 --> 07:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:51.110 --> 07:07:51.120 align:start position:0%

07:07:56.948 --> 07:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
now we're going to open the
 
07:08:01.110 --> 07:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing for senate bill 334
 
07:08:03.350 --> 07:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
07:08:05.030 --> 07:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
07:08:06.708 --> 07:08:06.718 align:start position:0%

okay get it go ahead got to get it all
 
07:08:42.788 --> 07:08:42.798 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]

in fact we were together last night i'm
 
07:09:17.190 --> 07:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
a former city councilor and mayor we
 
07:09:19.590 --> 07:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
were together at the um at the lebanon
 
07:09:21.830 --> 07:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
city council meeting so i have some deep
 
07:09:23.910 --> 07:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
roots in the work that you spend your
 
07:09:25.510 --> 07:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
time on here and appreciate that and i
 
07:09:26.948 --> 07:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
know what a long day you've had so i
 
07:09:29.190 --> 07:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
will try to keep this short so i'm
 
07:09:29.200 --> 07:09:31.270 align:start position:0%
will try to keep this short so i'm
introducing

07:09:31.270 --> 07:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
07:09:31.280 --> 07:09:32.310 align:start position:0%
introducing
a

07:09:32.310 --> 07:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:09:33.990 --> 07:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
study committee for
 
07:09:35.910 --> 07:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
property blight managed property blight
 
07:09:38.230 --> 07:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
in cities and towns and
 
07:09:40.070 --> 07:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
this came to me as a request to the city
 
07:09:42.390 --> 07:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
of clermont and actually at first
 
07:09:44.390 --> 07:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
my this is the amended version of this i
 
07:09:46.230 --> 07:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
was actually wanting to put in place a
 
07:09:48.468 --> 07:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
tool that's been used in neighboring
 
07:09:48.478 --> 07:09:49.590 align:start position:0%
tool that's been used in neighboring
states

07:09:49.590 --> 07:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
07:09:51.430 --> 07:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the country which is
 
07:09:53.590 --> 07:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for vacant building
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
registries because one of the common
 
07:09:56.788 --> 07:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
07:09:59.110 --> 07:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
vacant and or abandoned properties is
 
07:10:01.990 --> 07:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
finding the responsible party when there
 
07:10:05.110 --> 07:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
is a code violation there's you know and
 
07:10:07.670 --> 07:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
what the code you know whether it's
 
07:10:07.680 --> 07:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
what the code you know whether it's
multiple

07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
07:10:10.948 --> 07:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
whether there's water coming out the
 
07:10:12.628 --> 07:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
windows because the pipes are broken was
 
07:10:14.788 --> 07:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
an emergency whether there has been a
 
07:10:17.030 --> 07:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
minor fire on the property whether there
 
07:10:17.040 --> 07:10:17.830 align:start position:0%
minor fire on the property whether there
is

07:10:17.830 --> 07:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:10:19.350 --> 07:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
there are abandoned vehicles that are
 
07:10:20.868 --> 07:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
not registered there's a whole host of
 
07:10:23.830 --> 07:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
reasons but what we do know is when
 
07:10:25.830 --> 07:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
these conditions exist if they go
 
07:10:27.510 --> 07:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
unenforced by
 
07:10:29.270 --> 07:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
local officials
 
07:10:32.070 --> 07:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
then it starts to become a property
 
07:10:33.830 --> 07:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
value issue for the neighbors so it's
 
07:10:36.070 --> 07:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
not so much about that building as much
 
07:10:37.990 --> 07:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
as the impact that it has on the
 
07:10:40.468 --> 07:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
character of our neighborhoods um here
 
07:10:42.150 --> 07:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire and you know
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
certainly in the the communities that i
 
07:10:44.638 --> 07:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
certainly in the the communities that i
represent

07:10:45.910 --> 07:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
07:10:48.310 --> 07:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the most important things
 
07:10:50.788 --> 07:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
that we have in our lives is you know
 
07:10:53.750 --> 07:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
our our property and their value
 
07:10:55.670 --> 07:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
my mother just recently sold our
 
07:10:58.070 --> 07:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
childhood home in massachusetts and
 
07:10:59.910 --> 07:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
that as an out you know she's 90 years
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
old and that is the really the only you
 
07:11:04.548 --> 07:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
know besides the contents of that house
 
07:11:06.708 --> 07:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
that was her you know her only
 
07:11:08.708 --> 07:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
investment that she had left and she
 
07:11:10.310 --> 07:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
moved to new hampshire to one of the
 
07:11:12.230 --> 07:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
only homes that was
 
07:11:13.990 --> 07:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
was for sale at the end of my street
 
07:11:16.788 --> 07:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank god thankfully so anyway i
 
07:11:18.868 --> 07:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
originally tried to do a vacant building
 
07:11:20.390 --> 07:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
registry which is a tool that's been
 
07:11:22.708 --> 07:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
used but there was a lot of discussion
 
07:11:25.190 --> 07:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
about who was the responsible party
 
07:11:26.628 --> 07:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
because responsible parties we often
 
07:11:28.948 --> 07:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
think about are like the owners of a
 
07:11:31.110 --> 07:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
property but that you know like like say
 
07:11:32.390 --> 07:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
me but
 
07:11:34.628 --> 07:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's not always that case because the
 
07:11:35.990 --> 07:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
building might be in the hands of a
 
07:11:37.750 --> 07:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
creditor you know i worked with the
 
07:11:39.510 --> 07:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
bankers on this it might be a different
 
07:11:40.948 --> 07:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
it's not always
 
07:11:43.750 --> 07:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
a person it might be someone an agency
 
07:11:45.990 --> 07:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
or an entity that's owed money to and it
 
07:11:48.788 --> 07:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
may not even be a bank so it's who's
 
07:11:51.030 --> 07:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
first in line so that became an issue
 
07:11:53.030 --> 07:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
trying to really narrow that down and
 
07:11:55.110 --> 07:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
the other piece is what is what do we
 
07:11:57.910 --> 07:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
consider you know vacant or abandoned
 
07:11:59.750 --> 07:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know and there are some conditions
 
07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
that i brought forward but there was
 
07:12:04.548 --> 07:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
friendly disagreement about what those
 
07:12:06.788 --> 07:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
should actually be so
 
07:12:08.628 --> 07:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
my sense was i want to keep the
 
07:12:10.548 --> 07:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
conversation moving forward because i do
 
07:12:12.868 --> 07:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
believe that it is a tool to protect for
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
the communities that want to do it
 
07:12:15.750 --> 07:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
protect their character of their
 
07:12:17.190 --> 07:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and the property values
 
07:12:18.708 --> 07:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
within those neighborhoods
 
07:12:20.070 --> 07:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to get more
 
07:12:22.948 --> 07:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
agreement on what exactly
 
07:12:25.750 --> 07:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know vacant and abandoned properties
 
07:12:28.548 --> 07:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
would be and is there you know and what
 
07:12:30.788 --> 07:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
the responsible parties are and is this
 
07:12:32.310 --> 07:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
a tool that we actually want to enable
 
07:12:34.230 --> 07:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
our communities to use
 
07:12:36.788 --> 07:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire
 
07:12:39.350 --> 07:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a fan of of enabling legislation
 
07:12:41.110 --> 07:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
only because again a former mayor and
 
07:12:42.548 --> 07:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
city councilor
 
07:12:44.310 --> 07:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
there are some things that we did hur
 
07:12:47.510 --> 07:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier about solar exemptions
 
07:12:49.590 --> 07:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know as a as a city council or we
 
07:12:51.510 --> 07:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
had adopted that so we could actually
 
07:12:53.830 --> 07:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
provide exemptions you know and
 
07:12:55.430 --> 07:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know and have that as a tool for
 
07:12:57.030 --> 07:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
people so that's an example of something
 
07:12:59.110 --> 07:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's been done in the past that being
 
07:12:59.120 --> 07:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
that's been done in the past that being
said

07:13:00.150 --> 07:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:13:01.990 --> 07:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is what i want to do what i what i
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to move on
 
07:13:05.430 --> 07:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
but saw that we needed to really look
 
07:13:06.868 --> 07:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
into this and make sure that this was a
 
07:13:09.430 --> 07:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
good fit and we needed to gain agreement
 
07:13:11.750 --> 07:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i approached with you know the
 
07:13:14.150 --> 07:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee about an amendment which is a
 
07:13:16.468 --> 07:13:16.478 align:start position:0%
study committee and i we do have a date
 
07:13:17.990 --> 07:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at that this would be
 
07:13:18.000 --> 07:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at that this would be
done

07:13:19.110 --> 07:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
07:13:21.670 --> 07:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
an issue to report by november 1st and
 
07:13:23.110 --> 07:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know we may come out of that people
 
07:13:24.948 --> 07:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
might not you know agree and we might
 
07:13:27.110 --> 07:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
not have you know that might not be the
 
07:13:28.868 --> 07:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
tool to deal with blight there may be
 
07:13:30.788 --> 07:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
something else but i think the larger
 
07:13:32.948 --> 07:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to be had so with
 
07:13:35.030 --> 07:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that in mind i appreciate your time and
 
07:13:36.788 --> 07:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
the long day i've had i'm happy to take
 
07:13:38.948 --> 07:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
any questions and if i can't answer them
 
07:13:40.390 --> 07:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
i will
 
07:13:42.230 --> 07:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'll find an answer or i'll call senator
 
07:13:44.390 --> 07:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh perkinsquoke and ask her
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:51.190 --> 07:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and if i can i have two
 
07:13:54.788 --> 07:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh really quick questions uh
 
07:13:56.708 --> 07:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
you talked about abandoned
 
07:13:56.718 --> 07:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
you talked about abandoned
uh

07:13:57.590 --> 07:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:13:59.590 --> 07:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
housing and i've had a occasion i'm a
 
07:14:01.750 --> 07:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
selectman in hampstead and we had the
 
07:14:03.910 --> 07:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
occasion to
 
07:14:05.990 --> 07:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
end up having somebody actually tear
 
07:14:07.750 --> 07:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
down their house
 
07:14:10.548 --> 07:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
because it was vacant but
 
07:14:12.868 --> 07:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
my problem is with blight
 
07:14:14.788 --> 07:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
and it's sometimes it's in the eye of
 
07:14:17.030 --> 07:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
the beholder so my question is do you
 
07:14:19.190 --> 07:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
know what blight is
 
07:14:21.110 --> 07:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
well that's what we want to study okay
 
07:14:23.670 --> 07:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
because i have an idea and i put if you
 
07:14:25.510 --> 07:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
look at the bill before it was amended
 
07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
what i thought would be common
 
07:14:28.788 --> 07:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
definitions but we didn't have agreement
 
07:14:31.750 --> 07:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
on that so things like you know what the
 
07:14:33.990 --> 07:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
condition of the yard is unregistered
 
07:14:36.310 --> 07:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles you know damage to the property
 
07:14:38.070 --> 07:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
like broken windows there were different
 
07:14:40.548 --> 07:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
items like that that i had
 
07:14:43.030 --> 07:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
pulled together from similar legislation
 
07:14:44.948 --> 07:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
in other states but again there was not
 
07:14:46.948 --> 07:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
agreement on what the definition was so
 
07:14:48.868 --> 07:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
what we want to study is like you know
 
07:14:50.548 --> 07:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
what do we do about black is there black
 
07:14:51.670 --> 07:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
problem what do we do about it and
 
07:14:53.110 --> 07:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
should we enable communities to handle
 
07:14:55.270 --> 07:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
this so it's a really good question my
 
07:14:56.868 --> 07:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
07:14:58.868 --> 07:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
in your
 
07:15:02.788 --> 07:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
investigation into this uh problem do we
 
07:15:06.150 --> 07:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
have a rsa that we can hang our hat on
 
07:15:06.160 --> 07:15:07.110 align:start position:0%
have a rsa that we can hang our hat on
if

07:15:07.110 --> 07:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:15:09.910 --> 07:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh that would be the extension of
 
07:15:13.030 --> 07:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with blight so local
 
07:15:15.750 --> 07:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
officials uh have
 
07:15:17.670 --> 07:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to enforce you
 
07:15:19.430 --> 07:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
know their own ordinances and codes as
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's related to that but what often
 
07:15:23.190 --> 07:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
happens is
 
07:15:24.708 --> 07:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
that if you know and i know not every
 
07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
community is equal in terms of what they
 
07:15:28.310 --> 07:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
have available for municipal services
 
07:15:29.830 --> 07:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that's again why this would be
 
07:15:29.840 --> 07:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
and that's again why this would be
enabling

07:15:31.110 --> 07:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
07:15:31.120 --> 07:15:32.150 align:start position:0%
enabling
if

07:15:32.150 --> 07:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:15:34.548 --> 07:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
you can't find the responsible party
 
07:15:37.110 --> 07:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
because there's no central place to look
 
07:15:38.390 --> 07:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know and you're
 
07:15:39.830 --> 07:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know going down the line and trying
 
07:15:41.590 --> 07:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
to find that person it makes or or
 
07:15:43.350 --> 07:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
entity it makes it harder and harder to
 
07:15:45.110 --> 07:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually enforce this
 
07:15:48.150 --> 07:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
and if i may also offer um i have a
 
07:15:49.750 --> 07:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
background in public safety a long time
 
07:15:51.590 --> 07:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
paramedic and although i
 
07:15:54.310 --> 07:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't practice in the field anymore you
 
07:15:56.868 --> 07:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
know i often responded for with fire
 
07:15:58.788 --> 07:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
departments for water emergencies and
 
07:16:00.548 --> 07:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
abandoned properties where water was
 
07:16:01.830 --> 07:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
literally because the pipes had burst
 
07:16:04.788 --> 07:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
were coming out the windows like and
 
07:16:06.628 --> 07:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
or you know there had been a fire and
 
07:16:08.628 --> 07:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
our we're trying to find the responsible
 
07:16:10.628 --> 07:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
party because we have to not only deal
 
07:16:12.070 --> 07:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
with the emergency but release the
 
07:16:14.070 --> 07:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
property you know and have someone take
 
07:16:16.230 --> 07:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
it over and that was almost the hardest
 
07:16:18.628 --> 07:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
part of it was actually finding somebody
 
07:16:22.390 --> 07:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to so that's part of this but
 
07:16:24.708 --> 07:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
again going back
 
07:16:26.708 --> 07:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
is there an rsa that we're going to
 
07:16:27.990 --> 07:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
build on
 
07:16:30.788 --> 07:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
there is an rsa i don't have it in
 
07:16:32.788 --> 07:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
the language in here and i can add that
 
07:16:35.110 --> 07:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
but it allows the local communities to
 
07:16:36.948 --> 07:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
do the code enforcement okay so i can
 
07:16:38.468 --> 07:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
find it out anyway
 
07:16:40.150 --> 07:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for senate i appreciate it
 
07:16:41.990 --> 07:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you say hi to look counselor
 
07:16:44.708 --> 07:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
warnock or select warnock member
 
07:16:46.708 --> 07:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
07:16:48.548 --> 07:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:16:49.590 --> 07:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
07:16:51.510 --> 07:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh i noticed that you there's only like
 
07:16:53.030 --> 07:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
three members so
 
07:16:54.708 --> 07:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh one member from the senate and two
 
07:16:54.718 --> 07:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh one member from the senate and two
from

07:16:55.670 --> 07:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:16:57.110 --> 07:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the house
 
07:16:57.120 --> 07:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
the the house
uh

07:16:58.070 --> 07:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:17:01.110 --> 07:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
would you consider having someone from
 
07:17:03.750 --> 07:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
say a municipality or a city
 
07:17:05.110 --> 07:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
be part of the
 
07:17:06.628 --> 07:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
the study so that
 
07:17:09.590 --> 07:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
they'd add a little diversity to the
 
07:17:09.600 --> 07:17:10.628 align:start position:0%
they'd add a little diversity to the
study

07:17:10.628 --> 07:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
study
 
07:17:12.708 --> 07:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
so great question uh my understanding
 
07:17:14.628 --> 07:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
was and i heard i heard some folks say
 
07:17:16.948 --> 07:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
they were you know new to concord i'm a
 
07:17:18.868 --> 07:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
freshman senator so i'm a little new to
 
07:17:21.110 --> 07:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
this but what i understood was that for
 
07:17:22.868 --> 07:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
study committees we could only put
 
07:17:25.670 --> 07:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
members of say the legislature on but
 
07:17:27.430 --> 07:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
they're open i didn't do a commission i
 
07:17:29.910 --> 07:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a shorter window and so
 
07:17:31.510 --> 07:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
they uh these meetings are open and
 
07:17:33.190 --> 07:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
members of the public and these
 
07:17:34.868 --> 07:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
organizations like if i'm a study
 
07:17:35.910 --> 07:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee i'm going to make a list of
 
07:17:37.590 --> 07:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
who i want to talk to
 
07:17:39.190 --> 07:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to call them in including
 
07:17:41.190 --> 07:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities well thank you i'm wrong
 
07:17:43.030 --> 07:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
i've learned something today too that
 
07:17:44.708 --> 07:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
yeah if i'm wrong i'll fix that but that
 
07:17:46.388 --> 07:17:46.398 align:start position:0%
was my understanding
 
07:17:46.398 --> 07:17:47.270 align:start position:0%
was my understanding
so

07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:17:49.190 --> 07:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the senator yes
 
07:17:51.430 --> 07:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative ron thank you mr chair
 
07:17:52.788 --> 07:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator it's nice to see
 
07:17:55.110 --> 07:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
you nice to see you um
 
07:17:58.788 --> 07:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
along uh i chair a commission a
 
07:18:02.468 --> 07:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
statewide commission on pfas and uh
 
07:18:04.070 --> 07:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
my wonderful colleague from litchfield
 
07:18:05.910 --> 07:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
is on it with me and
 
07:18:08.468 --> 07:18:08.478 align:start position:0%
um we one of the things and i should
 
07:18:10.548 --> 07:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
have brought this up when um when
 
07:18:12.548 --> 07:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
senator perkins cloak introduced the
 
07:18:15.510 --> 07:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
last bill but she's here is um many
 
07:18:17.110 --> 07:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
times the and you're correct the
 
07:18:19.350 --> 07:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
commissions include other people or name
 
07:18:21.430 --> 07:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
other people outside the new hampshire
 
07:18:24.868 --> 07:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
general court but study committees only
 
07:18:27.670 --> 07:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
include those people who are members
 
07:18:27.680 --> 07:18:28.548 align:start position:0%
include those people who are members
but

07:18:28.548 --> 07:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:29.830 --> 07:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we found
 
07:18:32.788 --> 07:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
successful in the pfas commission is
 
07:18:35.110 --> 07:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
also recommending not just legislative
 
07:18:39.590 --> 07:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
remedies but non-legislative remedies so
 
07:18:40.708 --> 07:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's something that
 
07:18:42.708 --> 07:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
would deserve an amendment but it would
 
07:18:45.030 --> 07:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
be something to keep in mind i know
 
07:18:46.388 --> 07:18:46.398 align:start position:0%
there's been several things that we've
 
07:18:48.788 --> 07:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
been doing mainly around community
 
07:18:51.830 --> 07:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
engagement and communication holding
 
07:18:54.708 --> 07:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
town halls which don't require
 
07:18:56.708 --> 07:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
any legislative action but we've
 
07:18:59.350 --> 07:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
identified that as a need that our
 
07:19:01.110 --> 07:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
commission can fill
 
07:19:02.948 --> 07:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you you are welcome thank you
 
07:19:05.750 --> 07:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative rung uh that's
 
07:19:08.788 --> 07:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
a great observation because it is say
 
07:19:10.468 --> 07:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
you know because the originally i'd been
 
07:19:12.948 --> 07:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation and had shifted to
 
07:19:14.788 --> 07:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
a study committee so we could really dig
 
07:19:16.628 --> 07:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
into this deeper so
 
07:19:16.638 --> 07:19:18.628 align:start position:0%
into this deeper so
uh

07:19:18.628 --> 07:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:19:20.948 --> 07:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we can
 
07:19:23.030 --> 07:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
do that with this with us because you
 
07:19:24.948 --> 07:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
can do with the commission can we
 
07:19:24.958 --> 07:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
can do with the commission can we
and

07:19:25.670 --> 07:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:19:26.948 --> 07:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
i guess if we open the language all
 
07:19:28.628 --> 07:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
right well um
 
07:19:31.350 --> 07:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is actually i think a good
 
07:19:33.030 --> 07:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
approach you're having legislative
 
07:19:34.948 --> 07:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
representation and if you need to bring
 
07:19:37.270 --> 07:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
other people and you can but it's not
 
07:19:37.280 --> 07:19:38.628 align:start position:0%
other people and you can but it's not
required

07:19:38.628 --> 07:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
required
 
07:19:40.150 --> 07:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
07:19:43.910 --> 07:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
so this is actually a good approach
 
07:19:45.270 --> 07:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:19:47.510 --> 07:19:47.520 align:start position:0%

07:23:43.510 --> 07:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
senator rebecca perkins quoca
 
07:23:45.910 --> 07:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
representing district 21 portsmouth and
 
07:23:48.070 --> 07:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns um
 
07:23:50.788 --> 07:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
i am thrilled to be here in support of
 
07:23:54.468 --> 07:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
sb 400 today i think that um as has been
 
07:23:57.350 --> 07:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
previously discussed at length housing
 
07:23:59.750 --> 07:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
is an urgent problem in our state
 
07:24:03.830 --> 07:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is um a bipartisan bill that has
 
07:24:06.628 --> 07:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
technical solutions to our housing
 
07:24:09.590 --> 07:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
problem we call it the community toolbox
 
07:24:12.628 --> 07:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill because it's designed to provide
 
07:24:15.190 --> 07:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
tools to our municipalities
 
07:24:17.350 --> 07:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
there is nothing
 
07:24:19.270 --> 07:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll say that again just because
 
07:24:22.070 --> 07:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's important nothing in this bill that
 
07:24:26.070 --> 07:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
is mandatory it is voluntary
 
07:24:28.150 --> 07:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
options for our municipalities to
 
07:24:30.230 --> 07:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
address the housing crisis it's my
 
07:24:32.788 --> 07:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
belief that we need to do that little
 
07:24:36.388 --> 07:24:36.398 align:start position:0%
bit by little bit and so
 
07:24:40.310 --> 07:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
all parts of this bill are derived from
 
07:24:43.830 --> 07:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
many years of experience
 
07:24:45.510 --> 07:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the members of the governor's housing
 
07:24:48.310 --> 07:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
task force and are meant to be
 
07:24:48.320 --> 07:24:49.830 align:start position:0%
task force and are meant to be
ideas

07:24:49.830 --> 07:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
07:24:52.230 --> 07:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
that will help us tackle this problem a
 
07:24:55.270 --> 07:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
little bit by a little bit um
 
07:24:57.110 --> 07:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
i will say that the housing champions
 
07:24:58.788 --> 07:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
program is something i particularly
 
07:25:00.708 --> 07:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
think is
 
07:25:02.230 --> 07:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
something to be allotted for the state
 
07:25:04.150 --> 07:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the governor's
 
07:25:06.230 --> 07:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
recent announcement of the 100 million
 
07:25:08.070 --> 07:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
invest new hampshire fund
 
07:25:09.430 --> 07:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
07:25:12.150 --> 07:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
a program where municipalities can
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
voluntarily adopt housing friendly
 
07:25:16.948 --> 07:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
policies and
 
07:25:19.270 --> 07:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
by doing so
 
07:25:20.788 --> 07:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
now opd
 
07:25:25.430 --> 07:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:27.388 --> 07:25:27.398 align:start position:0%
incentives that would reward our
 
07:25:30.070 --> 07:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities for doing so so examples
 
07:25:32.948 --> 07:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
of that would be housing friendly zoning
 
07:25:35.110 --> 07:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
sewer and water improvements in parts of
 
07:25:39.430 --> 07:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
town where density could be accommodated
 
07:25:41.670 --> 07:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
or other planning you know towards
 
07:25:43.510 --> 07:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
supporting housing in our municipalities
 
07:25:44.868 --> 07:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
because we all know
 
07:25:46.628 --> 07:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
our towns and cities are the are the
 
07:25:48.948 --> 07:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
leaders in the front lines on this so i
 
07:25:50.548 --> 07:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
will leave it at that
 
07:25:52.388 --> 07:25:52.398 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions any
 
07:25:53.510 --> 07:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions to the senator yes
 
07:25:55.350 --> 07:25:55.360 align:start position:0%

as a matter of farm when i'm going to be
sitting

07:26:04.310 --> 07:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
07:26:05.990 --> 07:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
later in the
 
07:26:08.548 --> 07:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
testimony as an opponent to the bill if
 
07:26:11.750 --> 07:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can if are you the prime sponsor no
 
07:26:14.868 --> 07:26:14.878 align:start position:0%

you can't if you are your sponsor no
oh

07:26:16.070 --> 07:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:26:20.310 --> 07:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
so what other i just have questions of
 
07:26:23.750 --> 07:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
the senator when asking can i ask her
 
07:26:23.760 --> 07:26:24.948 align:start position:0%
the senator when asking can i ask her
questions

07:26:24.948 --> 07:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:26:27.270 --> 07:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to testify
 
07:26:29.990 --> 07:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
against the bill oh yes you can alright
 
07:26:32.628 --> 07:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator for
 
07:26:36.230 --> 07:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:39.350 --> 07:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes do you have any more detail as
 
07:26:39.360 --> 07:26:40.388 align:start position:0%
yes yes do you have any more detail as
to

07:26:40.388 --> 07:26:40.398 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:26:42.468 --> 07:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
what's going to make up the housing
 
07:26:45.190 --> 07:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
champion certificate
 
07:26:48.468 --> 07:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
the bill itself does not seem to
 
07:26:50.868 --> 07:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
dot the eyes across the t's you know
 
07:26:52.628 --> 07:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
where that information
 
07:26:54.948 --> 07:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
07:26:57.190 --> 07:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representatives so
 
07:26:59.750 --> 07:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a process that um the
 
07:27:00.948 --> 07:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
office of planning development
 
07:27:02.468 --> 07:27:02.478 align:start position:0%
underneath the bureau of economic
 
07:27:06.788 --> 07:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:08.868 --> 07:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
it would be probably a process where
 
07:27:10.868 --> 07:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
there would be input
 
07:27:13.270 --> 07:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
that could be made as it developed but
 
07:27:17.030 --> 07:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:19.430 --> 07:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
define everything in the bill but rather
 
07:27:21.190 --> 07:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had input for example
 
07:27:22.708 --> 07:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
from our municipalities about what would
 
07:27:24.388 --> 07:27:24.398 align:start position:0%
be most useful
 
07:27:28.070 --> 07:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
if i'd follow up mr chairman if i can i
 
07:27:30.070 --> 07:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about what the scoring when we
 
07:27:32.628 --> 07:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
got a scoring system what that means i
 
07:27:34.948 --> 07:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
mean i i know i think there's no
 
07:27:34.958 --> 07:27:36.468 align:start position:0%
mean i i know i think there's no
criteria

07:27:36.468 --> 07:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
07:27:39.430 --> 07:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
to to qualify there's
 
07:27:41.750 --> 07:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
no whether it's going to be a score of
 
07:27:43.910 --> 07:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
10 there's going to be a hundred i mean
 
07:27:47.270 --> 07:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm living a small community of 9 000
 
07:27:47.280 --> 07:27:48.548 align:start position:0%
i'm living a small community of 9 000
people

07:27:48.548 --> 07:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:27:52.150 --> 07:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
on a border community to massachusetts
 
07:27:52.160 --> 07:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
on a border community to massachusetts
we're

07:27:53.430 --> 07:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're
 
07:27:55.910 --> 07:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're in pretty good shape as a
 
07:27:55.920 --> 07:27:57.910 align:start position:0%
i think we're in pretty good shape as a
town

07:27:57.910 --> 07:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
town
 
07:28:00.150 --> 07:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
because we do business
 
07:28:03.030 --> 07:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
in a good manner and feel that we've got
 
07:28:04.628 --> 07:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
a good
 
07:28:06.708 --> 07:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
good town does that mean we can't
 
07:28:09.350 --> 07:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
qualify because some other community
 
07:28:12.310 --> 07:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
that may not do as good a job and may
 
07:28:12.320 --> 07:28:13.270 align:start position:0%
that may not do as good a job and may
have

07:28:13.270 --> 07:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:28:15.190 --> 07:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
problems that we don't have
 
07:28:17.990 --> 07:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
maybe even self-made are they gonna
 
07:28:19.350 --> 07:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're gonna get the money and i'm not
 
07:28:21.510 --> 07:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
gonna get any money yeah i see what you
 
07:28:22.708 --> 07:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
mean um
 
07:28:25.510 --> 07:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
the intent and i don't know that um you
 
07:28:27.270 --> 07:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
know the intent of the housing champion
 
07:28:29.590 --> 07:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
program is is to award money per se it
 
07:28:31.830 --> 07:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
could be for example that
 
07:28:33.910 --> 07:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
what's most useful to our municipalities
 
07:28:36.468 --> 07:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
is access to low interest money to build
 
07:28:38.468 --> 07:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
out their sewer and water for example
 
07:28:38.478 --> 07:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
out their sewer and water for example
but

07:28:39.350 --> 07:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:28:39.360 --> 07:28:40.548 align:start position:0%
but
um

07:28:40.548 --> 07:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:42.150 --> 07:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know the entire intent of the
 
07:28:44.628 --> 07:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
program is is to be something that's
 
07:28:47.110 --> 07:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
additional to where we are and so if
 
07:28:48.948 --> 07:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
your town um
 
07:28:49.910 --> 07:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
where are you from representing
 
07:28:51.510 --> 07:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampstead amsterdam maybe i shouldn't
 
07:28:53.670 --> 07:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
tell you yeah
 
07:28:53.680 --> 07:28:54.708 align:start position:0%
tell you yeah
um

07:28:54.708 --> 07:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:58.230 --> 07:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you feel that your town has
 
07:28:59.830 --> 07:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
done what they need to do on housing
 
07:29:02.868 --> 07:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
then this program wouldn't affect you if
 
07:29:04.548 --> 07:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
you felt that there were actions you
 
07:29:06.548 --> 07:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to take
 
07:29:07.830 --> 07:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know to
 
07:29:10.230 --> 07:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
to sort of do more on the housing front
 
07:29:10.240 --> 07:29:11.110 align:start position:0%
to sort of do more on the housing front
then

07:29:11.110 --> 07:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:29:13.430 --> 07:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
then you could participate and and maybe
 
07:29:14.788 --> 07:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
be eligible for something helpful to
 
07:29:16.708 --> 07:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
your town so uh
 
07:29:18.468 --> 07:29:18.478 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not something that's
 
07:29:20.708 --> 07:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
intended to um
 
07:29:22.070 --> 07:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe if there's some friendly
 
07:29:23.990 --> 07:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
competition but not to put towns against
 
07:29:26.548 --> 07:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
each other but just be an asset yeah
 
07:29:30.628 --> 07:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
i'm 92 years old i'm not very naive so
 
07:29:32.468 --> 07:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to express my concern
 
07:29:34.788 --> 07:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
about the program not knowing all the
 
07:29:36.468 --> 07:29:36.478 align:start position:0%
facts and thank you senator i appreciate
 
07:29:38.310 --> 07:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
it i understand i agree
 
07:29:42.310 --> 07:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives davis
 
07:29:43.990 --> 07:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
07:29:45.670 --> 07:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
07:29:48.388 --> 07:29:48.398 align:start position:0%
is this bill um
 
07:29:50.310 --> 07:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
related to
 
07:29:54.468 --> 07:29:54.478 align:start position:0%
house bill 1632 and senate bill 586
 
07:29:58.388 --> 07:29:58.398 align:start position:0%
1632 i believe was tabled and 586 was a
 
07:30:01.190 --> 07:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
victim of covet is this pretty much the
 
07:30:03.670 --> 07:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
same bill yes coming back again that's
 
07:30:06.388 --> 07:30:06.398 align:start position:0%
question one sure um
 
07:30:08.868 --> 07:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
there are many similarities there were
 
07:30:12.070 --> 07:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
some changes to accommodate um concerns
 
07:30:13.750 --> 07:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
that have been raised with previous
 
07:30:15.350 --> 07:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
versions of it and i'm going to
 
07:30:18.230 --> 07:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
respectfully defer to mr frost behind me
 
07:30:20.388 --> 07:30:20.398 align:start position:0%
because he he knows the ins and outs of
 
07:30:23.670 --> 07:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
that um but yes in short and follow up
 
07:30:27.350 --> 07:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair yes go ahead please um
 
07:30:29.750 --> 07:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate or do the do the
 
07:30:31.910 --> 07:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors anticipate that the work of
 
07:30:31.920 --> 07:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
sponsors anticipate that the work of
this

07:30:33.510 --> 07:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:30:33.520 --> 07:30:34.468 align:start position:0%
this
bill

07:30:34.468 --> 07:30:34.478 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:30:35.510 --> 07:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
should it
 
07:30:37.030 --> 07:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
be passed
 
07:30:39.990 --> 07:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
will dovetail in any way with the work
 
07:30:42.310 --> 07:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the commission that we previously
 
07:30:42.320 --> 07:30:43.590 align:start position:0%
of the commission that we previously
discussed

07:30:43.590 --> 07:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
07:30:45.750 --> 07:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess it's a rhetorical question
 
07:30:47.670 --> 07:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
because i can't see how one could
 
07:30:49.750 --> 07:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
proceed well without the other so i'm
 
07:30:51.510 --> 07:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
wondering you know are there
 
07:30:53.910 --> 07:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
conversations going on about
 
07:30:56.230 --> 07:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
meshing the work of these two groups
 
07:30:59.110 --> 07:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
sure and um and i appreciate the
 
07:31:01.350 --> 07:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
question very much so
 
07:31:04.788 --> 07:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
in in my mind and i don't want to speak
 
07:31:07.350 --> 07:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
for anyone other than myself but
 
07:31:09.350 --> 07:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know this bill represents the
 
07:31:09.360 --> 07:31:10.868 align:start position:0%
you know this bill represents the
solutions

07:31:10.868 --> 07:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
07:31:13.670 --> 07:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we could think of from a technical
 
07:31:14.548 --> 07:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:31:17.190 --> 07:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
non-political just merely trying to
 
07:31:19.190 --> 07:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
provide tools to our municipalities
 
07:31:22.230 --> 07:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
perspective at the time this was drafted
 
07:31:24.788 --> 07:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
if these are passed and available to our
 
07:31:26.868 --> 07:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
cities and towns we can then turn our
 
07:31:29.110 --> 07:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
attention to a new set of tools again
 
07:31:33.110 --> 07:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
support our municipalities um it without
 
07:31:34.388 --> 07:31:34.398 align:start position:0%
some of these in place i think it would
 
07:31:36.868 --> 07:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
be important to continue to to work for
 
07:31:38.388 --> 07:31:38.398 align:start position:0%
these and make sure that they are
 
07:31:40.548 --> 07:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
available because again
 
07:31:42.788 --> 07:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
the intent here is merely for the state
 
07:31:46.868 --> 07:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
to support our towns and cities on what
 
07:31:49.830 --> 07:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
should be an important goal um to all of
 
07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
us you know making sure that we address
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
housing that we have our next generation
 
07:31:55.830 --> 07:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
here um that we support our state
 
07:31:58.310 --> 07:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
economy and and that we make progress on
 
07:32:00.788 --> 07:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
the under supply of housing
 
07:32:01.990 --> 07:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:32:05.030 --> 07:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
07:32:06.708 --> 07:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
07:32:09.030 --> 07:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i have a number
 
07:32:10.948 --> 07:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
of questions and concerns with regards
 
07:32:12.868 --> 07:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
to this legislation but
 
07:32:15.430 --> 07:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
i can only ask one question right now
 
07:32:17.830 --> 07:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
and um i'd like to draw your attention
 
07:32:21.910 --> 07:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
to page six line fifteen section fifteen
 
07:32:23.430 --> 07:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
which um
 
07:32:26.310 --> 07:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
speaks to tax relief
 
07:32:30.070 --> 07:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
so um i am noting that the
 
07:32:30.080 --> 07:32:31.270 align:start position:0%
so um i am noting that the
um

07:32:31.270 --> 07:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:34.310 --> 07:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
that the number of years of tax relief
 
07:32:36.548 --> 07:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
has been increased from
 
07:32:36.558 --> 07:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
has been increased from
two

07:32:37.430 --> 07:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:32:39.910 --> 07:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
to up to four
 
07:32:39.920 --> 07:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
to up to four
years

07:32:41.430 --> 07:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:32:44.070 --> 07:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
to four to eight years and i'm also
 
07:32:47.030 --> 07:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
seeing a scribner's error on line 18
 
07:32:49.110 --> 07:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
that four should have been struck
 
07:32:51.030 --> 07:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
so that that's a concern because that's
 
07:32:53.350 --> 07:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax relief
 
07:32:55.110 --> 07:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and also if i'm understanding this
 
07:32:59.990 --> 07:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
correct is this not shifting taxation to
 
07:33:01.830 --> 07:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
current property tax
 
07:33:06.150 --> 07:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
payers within a municipality and
 
07:33:08.708 --> 07:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
how is that a good idea okay
 
07:33:09.670 --> 07:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
07:33:11.590 --> 07:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative so uh the provision
 
07:33:14.388 --> 07:33:14.398 align:start position:0%
you're talking about on on page six um
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
line fifteen it is indeed um enabling
 
07:33:22.388 --> 07:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow a municipality um
 
07:33:24.788 --> 07:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
to consider whether
 
07:33:28.150 --> 07:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh providing this tax relief would would
 
07:33:30.788 --> 07:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
work for that municipality so
 
07:33:32.948 --> 07:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
again um the intent of this bill is
 
07:33:34.708 --> 07:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
simply to provide tools to our
 
07:33:37.270 --> 07:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have that conversation
 
07:33:40.628 --> 07:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
um you are correct to say that when
 
07:33:43.430 --> 07:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
tax relief applies to one party
 
07:33:44.310 --> 07:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:33:46.548 --> 07:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
often it is done you know the amount of
 
07:33:48.150 --> 07:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
the tax is often applied to other
 
07:33:50.548 --> 07:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
parties but we do see this happen all
 
07:33:53.030 --> 07:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the time with um
 
07:33:55.270 --> 07:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know exemptions for the elderly for
 
07:33:57.590 --> 07:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of their assets for veterans
 
07:34:00.788 --> 07:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
um from local property tax and so
 
07:34:04.868 --> 07:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
it's a policy decision and in my mind um
 
07:34:08.868 --> 07:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's very likely not one that all 234 of
 
07:34:10.548 --> 07:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
our municipalities would make the same
 
07:34:12.230 --> 07:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
way and so
 
07:34:14.868 --> 07:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
in my mind by including a provision like
 
07:34:17.350 --> 07:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
section 15 um
 
07:34:19.110 --> 07:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
we we move that conversation to the
 
07:34:22.628 --> 07:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
local level where it can be had
 
07:34:25.270 --> 07:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you mr chair um and
 
07:34:26.548 --> 07:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
 
07:34:30.150 --> 07:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
question so um i would assume then is it
 
07:34:32.070 --> 07:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
possible for municipality to get an
 
07:34:35.830 --> 07:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
estimate as to how this would impact
 
07:34:39.190 --> 07:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
the current taxpayers locally and uh to
 
07:34:41.270 --> 07:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
be clear so what you're saying is that
 
07:34:43.830 --> 07:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
all these different provisions
 
07:34:46.548 --> 07:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
one through whatever it is
 
07:34:46.558 --> 07:34:47.590 align:start position:0%
one through whatever it is
what

07:34:47.590 --> 07:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
07:34:50.388 --> 07:34:50.398 align:start position:0%
i don't know one through let's say 20.
 
07:34:52.708 --> 07:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
each section can be it's enabling
 
07:34:55.350 --> 07:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
legislation individually and therefore
 
07:34:57.910 --> 07:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
each section would be put to the voters
 
07:34:59.110 --> 07:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
because i
 
07:35:02.070 --> 07:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
i like to see the exact wording as to
 
07:35:04.948 --> 07:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
how that would appear on the warrant and
 
07:35:07.030 --> 07:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
maybe this would make this bill
 
07:35:07.040 --> 07:35:08.310 align:start position:0%
maybe this would make this bill
humongous

07:35:08.310 --> 07:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
humongous
 
07:35:08.320 --> 07:35:09.670 align:start position:0%
humongous
but

07:35:09.670 --> 07:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:35:11.350 --> 07:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that because in other
 
07:35:13.670 --> 07:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
statutes where it isn't enabling
 
07:35:15.590 --> 07:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
legislation the question to be placed on
 
07:35:18.070 --> 07:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
the warrant is explicit
 
07:35:19.830 --> 07:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why that that isn't
 
07:35:21.990 --> 07:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
provided for okay that's um that's a
 
07:35:23.990 --> 07:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
helpful question and i appreciate it to
 
07:35:24.000 --> 07:35:25.350 align:start position:0%
helpful question and i appreciate it to
clarify

07:35:25.350 --> 07:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
07:35:25.360 --> 07:35:26.708 align:start position:0%
clarify
um

07:35:26.708 --> 07:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:35:29.110 --> 07:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
yes the intent is for all of this bill
 
07:35:31.110 --> 07:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be enabling but there are provisions
 
07:35:33.670 --> 07:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
in here that affect court procedures and
 
07:35:35.430 --> 07:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
07:35:38.788 --> 07:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
that would be sections 9 10 and 11 but
 
07:35:40.788 --> 07:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
other than that it is intended to be
 
07:35:45.430 --> 07:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
enabling i am going to respectfully um
 
07:35:48.468 --> 07:35:48.478 align:start position:0%
defer your question on warrant language
 
07:35:50.388 --> 07:35:50.398 align:start position:0%
to the folks that testify behind me just
 
07:35:52.070 --> 07:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
because i don't have the experience to
 
07:35:53.270 --> 07:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
answer your question about whether
 
07:35:56.708 --> 07:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
that's a standard practice or um or
 
07:35:58.070 --> 07:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether only included in some
 
07:35:58.080 --> 07:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
whether only included in some
legislation

07:36:00.310 --> 07:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:36:02.548 --> 07:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative maturi
 
07:36:04.150 --> 07:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
07:36:06.388 --> 07:36:06.398 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and my question
 
07:36:08.150 --> 07:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
is in the exact same section as
 
07:36:10.310 --> 07:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative power has but maybe
 
07:36:11.990 --> 07:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill
 
07:36:14.708 --> 07:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
where where the community or where where
 
07:36:16.868 --> 07:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
the uh where the issue might be that it
 
07:36:19.350 --> 07:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
meets workforce housing can we add
 
07:36:21.990 --> 07:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
something where it remains
 
07:36:24.628 --> 07:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
workforce housing my fear is that and
 
07:36:26.548 --> 07:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
maybe it's in here already and maybe mr
 
07:36:29.030 --> 07:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
frost can answer that my fear
 
07:36:30.150 --> 07:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:36:32.708 --> 07:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
you build something that meets
 
07:36:35.190 --> 07:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then after a while
 
07:36:37.430 --> 07:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
that goes away and we're back in the
 
07:36:39.430 --> 07:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
same place that we are now we have
 
07:36:41.590 --> 07:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
something that met that now does not
 
07:36:43.990 --> 07:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
meet and we've lost the great
 
07:36:46.070 --> 07:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
ground that we have gained is that
 
07:36:47.910 --> 07:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
possible to add something or does that
 
07:36:50.070 --> 07:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
exist um that's a great thank you for
 
07:36:51.110 --> 07:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
the quest
 
07:36:52.388 --> 07:36:52.398 align:start position:0%
of course yeah thank you for the
 
07:36:54.070 --> 07:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
question representative it's a great
 
07:36:56.468 --> 07:36:56.478 align:start position:0%
suggestion and um
 
07:36:58.230 --> 07:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know i think with your question you
 
07:37:00.548 --> 07:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
draw attention to the fact that this is
 
07:37:02.070 --> 07:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
not only about
 
07:37:03.430 --> 07:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
building new
 
07:37:05.590 --> 07:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
housing but it's also about retaining
 
07:37:09.590 --> 07:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
housing that remains affordable
 
07:37:09.600 --> 07:37:10.788 align:start position:0%
housing that remains affordable
because

07:37:10.788 --> 07:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:37:13.670 --> 07:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know otherwise we do see
 
07:37:15.750 --> 07:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
existing affordable housing redeveloped
 
07:37:17.910 --> 07:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes coming back on the market for
 
07:37:20.788 --> 07:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
higher prices so i think your suggestion
 
07:37:22.468 --> 07:37:22.478 align:start position:0%
holds a lot of merit and i for one would
 
07:37:25.430 --> 07:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to discussing it
 
07:37:25.440 --> 07:37:29.110 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to discussing it
representative

07:37:29.110 --> 07:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:30.948 --> 07:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you again
 
07:37:30.958 --> 07:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you again
senator

07:37:31.990 --> 07:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
senator
 
07:37:34.468 --> 07:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoca
 
07:37:36.070 --> 07:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
to follow on with the questions that
 
07:37:38.788 --> 07:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
you've just had about tax relief and
 
07:37:41.670 --> 07:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
about the continued affordability
 
07:37:44.230 --> 07:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
is it not true that
 
07:37:47.350 --> 07:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
as we have a more adequate supply of
 
07:37:47.360 --> 07:37:48.830 align:start position:0%
as we have a more adequate supply of
housing

07:37:48.830 --> 07:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
07:37:52.868 --> 07:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
the constant upward pressure
 
07:37:54.948 --> 07:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
does diminish to some case i'm just
 
07:37:56.548 --> 07:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
thinking about this whole question about
 
07:37:58.468 --> 07:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
how do we maintain affordable housing as
 
07:37:58.478 --> 07:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
how do we maintain affordable housing as
affordable

07:37:59.750 --> 07:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
07:38:04.310 --> 07:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
and what's your take on that
 
07:38:05.430 --> 07:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
07:38:08.070 --> 07:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
the question was if we have more houses
 
07:38:10.468 --> 07:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
don't they stop going up in price every
 
07:38:12.468 --> 07:38:12.478 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
07:38:15.750 --> 07:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for simplifying it's late
 
07:38:19.910 --> 07:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i mean just as someone that's
 
07:38:22.230 --> 07:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
been in this field um not even in this
 
07:38:24.150 --> 07:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
field just as an advocate in this field
 
07:38:27.030 --> 07:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know for 10 or 12 years um it you
 
07:38:27.040 --> 07:38:28.230 align:start position:0%
you know for 10 or 12 years um it you
know

07:38:28.230 --> 07:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:38:28.240 --> 07:38:29.670 align:start position:0%
know
everyone

07:38:29.670 --> 07:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
07:38:31.830 --> 07:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
i have spoken to and and i continue to
 
07:38:33.750 --> 07:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
believe and continue to see research on
 
07:38:36.230 --> 07:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the long-term solution to
 
07:38:38.628 --> 07:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
this problem is supply you know we have
 
07:38:40.868 --> 07:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
a lack of housing supply and in places
 
07:38:42.310 --> 07:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
like portsmouth
 
07:38:44.150 --> 07:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
if we had just seen a one percent
 
07:38:46.548 --> 07:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
increase in our housing stock per year
 
07:38:48.230 --> 07:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years it would have
 
07:38:50.388 --> 07:38:50.398 align:start position:0%
made a meaningful impact on the prices
 
07:38:53.030 --> 07:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we have now so
 
07:38:55.110 --> 07:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up because i
 
07:38:57.110 --> 07:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
should have started by saying you know
 
07:38:57.120 --> 07:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
should have started by saying you know
the

07:38:58.070 --> 07:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:38:59.750 --> 07:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing has published a
 
07:39:02.150 --> 07:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
figure of a shortage of 20 000 housing
 
07:39:04.310 --> 07:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
units statewide
 
07:39:06.070 --> 07:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
and the tools that we are trying to
 
07:39:09.590 --> 07:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide are towards the end of um of
 
07:39:11.750 --> 07:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
increasing housing supply to meet rising
 
07:39:14.548 --> 07:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
demand and ultimately bring prices down
 
07:39:14.558 --> 07:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
demand and ultimately bring prices down
so

07:39:15.430 --> 07:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:39:17.670 --> 07:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:39:19.350 --> 07:39:19.360 align:start position:0%

following up on that line 17-21
 
07:39:44.150 --> 07:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
what what
 
07:39:47.110 --> 07:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
would be the maximum amount of years for
 
07:39:49.270 --> 07:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
07:39:52.310 --> 07:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
and who would support that i mean is the
 
07:39:55.590 --> 07:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
tax shift going right to the taxpayers
 
07:39:57.990 --> 07:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
for six i don't know is it does it go up
 
07:39:59.430 --> 07:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
to 16 years
 
07:40:00.868 --> 07:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
07:40:03.350 --> 07:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and i respectfully
 
07:40:05.110 --> 07:40:05.120 align:start position:0%

new hampshire municipal association um

in the interest of time we are neutral
 
07:40:37.270 --> 07:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh we did do a fiscal note
 
07:40:38.868 --> 07:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
which very nicely summarizes our
 
07:40:40.788 --> 07:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
position which is results would vary on
 
07:40:42.548 --> 07:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
a town by town basis
 
07:40:45.270 --> 07:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions
 
07:40:49.590 --> 07:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:57.830 --> 07:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:59.510 --> 07:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
we should model our rest of our
 
07:41:03.990 --> 07:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:06.788 --> 07:41:06.798 align:start position:0%

sure

sure
 
07:42:24.708 --> 07:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:26.628 --> 07:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
as that's going around that is a letter
 
07:42:28.468 --> 07:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
from our executive director rob dapis
 
07:42:30.548 --> 07:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
who very much wished to have been here
 
07:42:31.750 --> 07:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
today but
 
07:42:33.430 --> 07:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
came down with a sore throat this
 
07:42:35.590 --> 07:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
morning and didn't want to
 
07:42:41.190 --> 07:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:42.388 --> 07:42:42.398 align:start position:0%
his letter
 
07:42:44.628 --> 07:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
expresses new hampshire housing's strong
 
07:42:47.350 --> 07:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
support for this legislation noting that
 
07:42:50.230 --> 07:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
we did participate as
 
07:42:51.910 --> 07:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
members of the governor's housing task
 
07:42:56.628 --> 07:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:59.350 --> 07:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the letter also indicates uh the you
 
07:43:01.110 --> 07:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
know the the dire state of the housing
 
07:43:03.030 --> 07:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
market in new hampshire uh referred to
 
07:43:05.350 --> 07:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
many by as a crisis i would agree with
 
07:43:05.360 --> 07:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
many by as a crisis i would agree with
that

07:43:06.070 --> 07:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:43:08.388 --> 07:43:08.398 align:start position:0%
uh my colleague jack ruderman testifying
 
07:43:11.190 --> 07:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 329 gave you some figures
 
07:43:13.030 --> 07:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
on on just how tough it is out there and
 
07:43:14.788 --> 07:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
it is it is really tough
 
07:43:16.868 --> 07:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
you can't excuse me would you bring the
 
07:43:19.190 --> 07:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
mic closer i can here
 
07:43:20.948 --> 07:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
i will certainly do that looks like
 
07:43:22.868 --> 07:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you how's that
 
07:43:25.190 --> 07:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:43:25.200 --> 07:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
all right
um

07:43:27.350 --> 07:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:29.910 --> 07:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the housing market is a question of both
 
07:43:31.670 --> 07:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
supply and demand we have
 
07:43:34.310 --> 07:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
great demand for housing part of it is
 
07:43:35.910 --> 07:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
an increased number of people moving
 
07:43:38.310 --> 07:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
from uh out of state although
 
07:43:40.708 --> 07:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
the numbers uh generally don't suggest
 
07:43:42.548 --> 07:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
that there's been a tidal wave of people
 
07:43:45.030 --> 07:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
moving from massachusetts during covid
 
07:43:47.750 --> 07:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
but there has been uh an increase in
 
07:43:50.070 --> 07:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and probably more in some
 
07:43:52.468 --> 07:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
communities than in others
 
07:43:54.388 --> 07:43:54.398 align:start position:0%
the fact is that most of the
 
07:43:56.868 --> 07:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
purchasers in new hampshire continue to
 
07:43:59.270 --> 07:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
be from new hampshire most most people
 
07:44:01.750 --> 07:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
most purchasers are local to their uh
 
07:44:03.910 --> 07:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
their own communities
 
07:44:03.920 --> 07:44:04.948 align:start position:0%
their own communities
but

07:44:04.948 --> 07:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:44:06.150 --> 07:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
as as
 
07:44:09.190 --> 07:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
as jack rudeman indicated the numbers of
 
07:44:12.468 --> 07:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
houses on the market for purchase is uh
 
07:44:14.310 --> 07:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
shockingly low
 
07:44:17.350 --> 07:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's below 1 000 for the entire state
 
07:44:20.708 --> 07:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
homes on the market right now
 
07:44:22.230 --> 07:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that pushes people into rental and
 
07:44:23.910 --> 07:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that pushes the rental prices up it is a
 
07:44:25.670 --> 07:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
question of supply and demand and right
 
07:44:27.350 --> 07:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
now we have a problem
 
07:44:28.548 --> 07:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
of supply
 
07:44:32.070 --> 07:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 400 presents uh a series of
 
07:44:35.350 --> 07:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
changes uh and incentives changes to the
 
07:44:38.230 --> 07:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
local processes to make the process
 
07:44:40.150 --> 07:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
more efficient incentives that
 
07:44:42.310 --> 07:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities can avail themselves of
 
07:44:44.868 --> 07:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
to help induce development
 
07:44:47.350 --> 07:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
of housing
 
07:44:49.270 --> 07:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to
 
07:44:51.110 --> 07:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
go through any of the sections of the
 
07:44:52.708 --> 07:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
bill that you wish
 
07:44:54.868 --> 07:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman i'm at your disposal i
 
07:44:54.878 --> 07:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman i'm at your disposal i
recall

07:44:55.830 --> 07:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
recall
 
07:44:59.030 --> 07:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 586 i testified before
 
07:45:01.430 --> 07:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
this committee for two hours
 
07:45:01.440 --> 07:45:02.230 align:start position:0%
this committee for two hours
i

07:45:02.230 --> 07:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:45:04.230 --> 07:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
don't think you want to be doing that
 
07:45:04.240 --> 07:45:06.708 align:start position:0%
don't think you want to be doing that
today

07:45:06.708 --> 07:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:09.910 --> 07:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
um you get two hours two hours okay uh i
 
07:45:11.430 --> 07:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
always want to ask you a quick question
 
07:45:13.510 --> 07:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman you you and i work
 
07:45:16.948 --> 07:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
together on senator clark's commission
 
07:45:23.590 --> 07:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:26.150 --> 07:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
emanate from that work back then or is
 
07:45:28.868 --> 07:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
this a completely different uh
 
07:45:30.548 --> 07:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think it is
 
07:45:30.558 --> 07:45:32.070 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think it is
different

07:45:32.070 --> 07:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:45:32.080 --> 07:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
different
but

07:45:33.270 --> 07:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:45:34.948 --> 07:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think back to the report
 
07:45:37.190 --> 07:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
on that commission
 
07:45:37.200 --> 07:45:37.990 align:start position:0%
on that commission
and

07:45:37.990 --> 07:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:45:39.750 --> 07:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think for the most part these are
 
07:45:41.430 --> 07:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
different things
 
07:45:43.190 --> 07:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
mainly because
 
07:45:45.190 --> 07:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
that commission was looking at
 
07:45:47.350 --> 07:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
big picture things and and this is
 
07:45:49.110 --> 07:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
really getting down into the details of
 
07:45:51.030 --> 07:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
the local process
 
07:45:51.040 --> 07:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
the local process
um

07:45:53.030 --> 07:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:54.708 --> 07:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
are there members of the committee that
 
07:45:56.868 --> 07:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
have specific questions that
 
07:45:58.708 --> 07:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:46:00.468 --> 07:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
i did i was writing down the questions
 
07:46:03.190 --> 07:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i could start with those and and it
 
07:46:05.270 --> 07:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
and seek to address the questions that
 
07:46:07.270 --> 07:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
were previously asked by representatives
 
07:46:09.270 --> 07:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
davis guthrie power
 
07:46:12.070 --> 07:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh maduri and uh the vice chair
 
07:46:13.350 --> 07:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
all right once you do that then we'll
 
07:46:15.190 --> 07:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
come back and get uh representative
 
07:46:17.990 --> 07:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
vasalis representative power and anyone
 
07:46:20.788 --> 07:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
else who has open questions um so
 
07:46:23.030 --> 07:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative stavis asked if this was
 
07:46:25.670 --> 07:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh linked to if there were a link could
 
07:46:27.990 --> 07:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
be a link to uh the
 
07:46:30.230 --> 07:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill previously heard
 
07:46:31.830 --> 07:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
twice before
 
07:46:35.510 --> 07:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 329 the density commission
 
07:46:38.868 --> 07:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
and i'd say yes
 
07:46:40.868 --> 07:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
07:46:43.110 --> 07:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
the one proceeding does not mean that
 
07:46:44.868 --> 07:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
the other can't also proceed they
 
07:46:47.990 --> 07:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't the the the commission uh that
 
07:46:51.590 --> 07:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh senator perkins cuoco is uh bill is
 
07:46:53.830 --> 07:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
would propose creating might very well
 
07:46:55.750 --> 07:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
come up with some different things than
 
07:46:57.910 --> 07:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
are in this legislation and i frankly
 
07:46:59.910 --> 07:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
would expect it to
 
07:47:01.830 --> 07:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i think the measures that are
 
07:47:03.830 --> 07:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
proposed here are really getting down
 
07:47:06.468 --> 07:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
into the details whereas that commission
 
07:47:09.030 --> 07:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
might have um much higher issues that
 
07:47:11.110 --> 07:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with i think they can
 
07:47:13.110 --> 07:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
proceed in tandem
 
07:47:13.120 --> 07:47:14.388 align:start position:0%
proceed in tandem
um

07:47:14.388 --> 07:47:14.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:47:16.468 --> 07:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
and representative davis you also asked
 
07:47:18.628 --> 07:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
if there were changes from house bill
 
07:47:21.270 --> 07:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
586 and indeed there are and senator
 
07:47:23.670 --> 07:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca noted there was a change
 
07:47:25.510 --> 07:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
07:47:28.150 --> 07:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
the the tiff district section and i'll
 
07:47:34.150 --> 07:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:38.948 --> 07:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:41.350 --> 07:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
section 13
 
07:47:45.430 --> 07:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:47.830 --> 07:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the language and this starts on
 
07:47:50.388 --> 07:47:50.398 align:start position:0%
on line 32.
 
07:47:54.548 --> 07:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh the language from line 32 through 34
 
07:47:56.948 --> 07:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
came from house bill 586 and also came
 
07:47:56.958 --> 07:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
came from house bill 586 and also came
from

07:47:59.030 --> 07:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:48:02.548 --> 07:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
prior to that house bill 1629 in the
 
07:48:05.670 --> 07:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:09.350 --> 07:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
what's new here this is a response to
 
07:48:09.360 --> 07:48:10.628 align:start position:0%
what's new here this is a response to
a

07:48:10.628 --> 07:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:48:12.388 --> 07:48:12.398 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion the debate on the
 
07:48:13.910 --> 07:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill on the floor of the house house
 
07:48:17.030 --> 07:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill 586 last year when it was tabled
 
07:48:19.190 --> 07:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
one of the criticisms
 
07:48:20.948 --> 07:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
and this was by representative barbara
 
07:48:20.958 --> 07:48:22.150 align:start position:0%
and this was by representative barbara
griffin

07:48:22.150 --> 07:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
griffin
 
07:48:22.160 --> 07:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
griffin
that

07:48:23.030 --> 07:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:48:26.708 --> 07:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
she said accurately that
 
07:48:29.350 --> 07:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
a municipality could use the power of
 
07:48:31.990 --> 07:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
eminent domain to take private property
 
07:48:32.000 --> 07:48:33.430 align:start position:0%
eminent domain to take private property
to

07:48:33.430 --> 07:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:48:35.590 --> 07:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
create workforce housing and
 
07:48:36.788 --> 07:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
07:48:39.030 --> 07:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of that happening is very
 
07:48:42.230 --> 07:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
very very remote but she was correct in
 
07:48:45.350 --> 07:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
in effect in saying that it was possible
 
07:48:48.310 --> 07:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
but the change this year is to directly
 
07:48:49.990 --> 07:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
07:48:52.310 --> 07:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh by saying and this is new language
 
07:48:54.388 --> 07:48:54.398 align:start position:0%
starting at the very end of line 34 on
 
07:48:55.750 --> 07:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
page five
 
07:48:57.750 --> 07:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall not acquire
 
07:48:59.510 --> 07:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
property for this purpose through the
 
07:49:01.430 --> 07:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
powers of eminent domain
 
07:49:04.788 --> 07:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
expressly forbidding the use of tif
 
07:49:07.510 --> 07:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
districts to use eminent domain to
 
07:49:09.270 --> 07:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
create workforce housing that is a
 
07:49:11.190 --> 07:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
direct response to representative
 
07:49:13.430 --> 07:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
griffin's comment last year
 
07:49:15.830 --> 07:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other change is a very minor change
 
07:49:17.430 --> 07:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that is in the workforce housing
 
07:49:21.110 --> 07:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
definition uh previously uh house bill
 
07:49:23.430 --> 07:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
586 and before it
 
07:49:25.830 --> 07:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
that might have been house bill 1629 or
 
07:49:28.830 --> 07:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
1632 uh in
 
07:49:30.948 --> 07:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
2020. uh
 
07:49:30.958 --> 07:49:31.910 align:start position:0%
2020. uh
talk

07:49:31.910 --> 07:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
talk
 
07:49:33.750 --> 07:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
would have changed
 
07:49:36.150 --> 07:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
the definition of workforce housing to
 
07:49:39.110 --> 07:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
allow it to be affordable to people
 
07:49:42.468 --> 07:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
making incomes of up to 120 percent of
 
07:49:46.708 --> 07:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:49.350 --> 07:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
reflecting on that we looked at
 
07:49:51.110 --> 07:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
this did the math
 
07:49:52.708 --> 07:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
on what that would mean
 
07:49:52.718 --> 07:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
on what that would mean
and

07:49:54.230 --> 07:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:56.708 --> 07:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
that pushed the recommended purchase
 
07:49:58.788 --> 07:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
prices as workforce housing to a number
 
07:50:02.468 --> 07:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
that just seemed unpalatably high
 
07:50:05.110 --> 07:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
so for something to be affordable to a
 
07:50:08.230 --> 07:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
family of four making 120 percent of the
 
07:50:10.708 --> 07:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
median income for an area in some parts
 
07:50:11.830 --> 07:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
07:50:13.590 --> 07:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
would would mean that workforce housing
 
07:50:15.670 --> 07:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
could be sold at over six hundred
 
07:50:17.910 --> 07:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and that just did not
 
07:50:19.990 --> 07:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
seem right uh so
 
07:50:20.000 --> 07:50:20.788 align:start position:0%
seem right uh so
uh

07:50:20.788 --> 07:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:50:23.590 --> 07:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
we recommended to senator bradley uh
 
07:50:26.230 --> 07:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
that that be struck from the legislation
 
07:50:29.190 --> 07:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
keep and to keep the existing definition
 
07:50:31.430 --> 07:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
of workforce housing as it exists in the
 
07:50:34.548 --> 07:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
law now and has since 2008
 
07:50:37.190 --> 07:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
at 100 percent of the area median income
 
07:50:38.948 --> 07:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
still it's a big number
 
07:50:40.548 --> 07:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
but it is the number we've been working
 
07:50:42.230 --> 07:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
with uh for
 
07:50:44.468 --> 07:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
now 14 years
 
07:50:47.270 --> 07:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
so those are the two changes uh from
 
07:50:52.310 --> 07:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:55.350 --> 07:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie you you asked
 
07:50:57.990 --> 07:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
senator perkins quoca about uh the the
 
07:51:00.868 --> 07:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
um the scoring system for the housing uh
 
07:51:03.670 --> 07:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
champions uh i would urge you to
 
07:51:05.750 --> 07:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that that would go through the
 
07:51:08.548 --> 07:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
standard jl car process
 
07:51:08.558 --> 07:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
standard jl car process
so

07:51:09.510 --> 07:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:51:11.350 --> 07:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
anyone i'm not sure if anyone here
 
07:51:13.830 --> 07:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
serves on jlcarr but it is a pretty
 
07:51:16.868 --> 07:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
rigorous process of policing
 
07:51:19.990 --> 07:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
how agencies do rule making and
 
07:51:20.000 --> 07:51:21.110 align:start position:0%
how agencies do rule making and
so

07:51:21.110 --> 07:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:51:23.510 --> 07:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think you know jlcarr and the office i
 
07:51:25.750 --> 07:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
guess it would be the lba would ensure
 
07:51:27.750 --> 07:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
that the scoring system that the office
 
07:51:29.190 --> 07:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
of planning and development comes up
 
07:51:33.990 --> 07:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:36.150 --> 07:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
so that's my response to that that point
 
07:51:37.510 --> 07:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
07:51:39.350 --> 07:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:51:40.948 --> 07:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
07:51:43.830 --> 07:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh you asked about the section dealing
 
07:51:54.230 --> 07:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:54.240 --> 07:51:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:51:58.868 --> 07:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:00.948 --> 07:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that that is a
 
07:52:02.788 --> 07:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
scrivener's error it looks like there is
 
07:52:04.628 --> 07:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
a strike through it but it's it's part
 
07:52:05.910 --> 07:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the four
 
07:52:08.708 --> 07:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
on line 18.
 
07:52:11.190 --> 07:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
but your substance your substantive
 
07:52:13.670 --> 07:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
question was um
 
07:52:16.708 --> 07:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
whether this was a a tax shift
 
07:52:16.718 --> 07:52:17.670 align:start position:0%
whether this was a a tax shift
and

07:52:17.670 --> 07:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:52:20.548 --> 07:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
it is and that is that is the design
 
07:52:23.750 --> 07:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
of rsa 79e which is a statute that has
 
07:52:26.548 --> 07:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
existed since the legislature adopted it
 
07:52:29.110 --> 07:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
in 2006.
 
07:52:31.830 --> 07:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
it is local option so municipalities
 
07:52:34.388 --> 07:52:34.398 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want to do this and
 
07:52:35.830 --> 07:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to do it they don't
 
07:52:37.910 --> 07:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
do it but a lot of municipalities have
 
07:52:41.350 --> 07:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
adopted some provisions of rsa 79e which
 
07:52:43.270 --> 07:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
is the community revitalization tax
 
07:52:45.510 --> 07:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
relief incentive
 
07:52:47.430 --> 07:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
to induce
 
07:52:49.670 --> 07:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
the redevelopment of properties you know
 
07:52:51.190 --> 07:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
derelict properties that have been
 
07:52:51.200 --> 07:52:52.310 align:start position:0%
derelict properties that have been
sitting

07:52:52.310 --> 07:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
07:52:54.070 --> 07:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
unused for years
 
07:52:55.590 --> 07:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
because the owners
 
07:52:56.868 --> 07:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason don't have the
 
07:52:59.110 --> 07:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
capital to do it this is a means by
 
07:53:01.430 --> 07:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
which a municipality can induce a
 
07:53:03.990 --> 07:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
property owner to rehabilitate property
 
07:53:05.270 --> 07:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
by giving them
 
07:53:08.868 --> 07:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh some relief in increased taxation
 
07:53:11.750 --> 07:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's attributable to the rehab cost
 
07:53:13.430 --> 07:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
the the value of rehab that they put
 
07:53:14.388 --> 07:53:14.398 align:start position:0%
into it
 
07:53:17.990 --> 07:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the idea and is this universally true
 
07:53:19.590 --> 07:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
no probably not
 
07:53:23.270 --> 07:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
but the idea is uh it's to induce
 
07:53:25.430 --> 07:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
redevelopment to increase
 
07:53:27.510 --> 07:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
taxable valuation
 
07:53:30.070 --> 07:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
that would not have occurred but for the
 
07:53:32.628 --> 07:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
availability of this incentive
 
07:53:35.430 --> 07:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
so the property owner gets a a relief
 
07:53:37.030 --> 07:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
from increased taxation that's
 
07:53:39.990 --> 07:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
attributable to the the value that's
 
07:53:41.510 --> 07:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
brought back to the property for a
 
07:53:44.150 --> 07:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
limited period of time after which
 
07:53:46.230 --> 07:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's fully taxed at its full fair market
 
07:53:46.240 --> 07:53:47.190 align:start position:0%
it's fully taxed at its full fair market
value

07:53:47.190 --> 07:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
value
 
07:53:48.948 --> 07:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
so there is that limited period of time
 
07:53:51.910 --> 07:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
when there is a shift in taxation
 
07:53:51.920 --> 07:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
when there is a shift in taxation
but

07:53:53.030 --> 07:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:53:54.708 --> 07:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
the argument is
 
07:53:57.190 --> 07:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
that that increase in tax taxable value
 
07:53:59.430 --> 07:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
might not have happened but for the the
 
07:54:01.670 --> 07:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
incentive that exists
 
07:54:01.680 --> 07:54:03.430 align:start position:0%
incentive that exists
um

07:54:03.430 --> 07:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:54:04.868 --> 07:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
there have not been any studies done on
 
07:54:06.548 --> 07:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
that uh but that's the that was the
 
07:54:08.868 --> 07:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
theory behind it at the time
 
07:54:12.070 --> 07:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
um uh and representative power you also
 
07:54:14.230 --> 07:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
asked about uh the estimates of local
 
07:54:17.430 --> 07:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
impact um i i would think that any
 
07:54:17.440 --> 07:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
impact um i i would think that any
municipality

07:54:19.030 --> 07:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
07:54:21.110 --> 07:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was the governing body of any
 
07:54:22.788 --> 07:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
municipality that was thinking about
 
07:54:25.350 --> 07:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
proposing this to the voters would want
 
07:54:26.310 --> 07:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
to do
 
07:54:29.110 --> 07:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of estimate of impact it is a
 
07:54:31.190 --> 07:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
local question though and so it's
 
07:54:33.990 --> 07:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
something that your local select board
 
07:54:35.110 --> 07:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
should do
 
07:54:36.868 --> 07:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
when they're thinking about doing it and
 
07:54:38.948 --> 07:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
presenting it to the voters as a means
 
07:54:40.788 --> 07:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
of saying this is what the impact will
 
07:54:42.788 --> 07:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
be this is the the shifting of taxes
 
07:54:45.190 --> 07:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
that what might occur over what period
 
07:54:48.230 --> 07:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:50.150 --> 07:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
but recognize too
 
07:54:52.310 --> 07:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
that these are all individualized
 
07:54:54.548 --> 07:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
decisions under the statute
 
07:54:54.558 --> 07:54:55.750 align:start position:0%
decisions under the statute
so

07:54:55.750 --> 07:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:54:57.110 --> 07:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
for any
 
07:54:59.590 --> 07:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
single property to get this tax relief
 
07:55:02.070 --> 07:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
even after the municipality has adopted
 
07:55:03.910 --> 07:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
the power to do it
 
07:55:07.430 --> 07:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
each property has to go before the local
 
07:55:09.990 --> 07:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
governing body the select board
 
07:55:12.310 --> 07:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
for access to this and have to get
 
07:55:14.788 --> 07:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
specific individual approval
 
07:55:16.948 --> 07:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
for each of these tax reliefs it's not a
 
07:55:19.030 --> 07:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
not a blanket approval once the town
 
07:55:21.030 --> 07:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
meeting adopts it
 
07:55:22.708 --> 07:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
it is it's a pretty
 
07:55:22.718 --> 07:55:23.910 align:start position:0%
it is it's a pretty
uh

07:55:23.910 --> 07:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:55:28.388 --> 07:55:28.398 align:start position:0%
rigorous approach to getting tax relief
 
07:55:28.398 --> 07:55:30.150 align:start position:0%
rigorous approach to getting tax relief
um

07:55:30.150 --> 07:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:55:31.190 --> 07:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
07:55:33.110 --> 07:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
last question represent representative
 
07:55:35.110 --> 07:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
power you you had asked about the the
 
07:55:37.990 --> 07:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
process and there is an existing process
 
07:55:41.430 --> 07:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
for adoption of rsa 79e and this is you
 
07:55:44.628 --> 07:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
look to 79e colon three and that spells
 
07:55:46.868 --> 07:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
out the process by which a municipality
 
07:55:49.910 --> 07:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
would adopt these the provisions
 
07:55:51.910 --> 07:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the existing statute
 
07:55:53.670 --> 07:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that would apply as well to what's
 
07:55:56.388 --> 07:55:56.398 align:start position:0%
proposed here in senate bill 400
 
07:55:57.270 --> 07:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
so this
 
07:56:00.788 --> 07:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
rsa 79 he e has been around since 2006
 
07:56:02.788 --> 07:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
it is a well-established mechanism that
 
07:56:05.110 --> 07:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of municipalities have used very
 
07:56:07.110 --> 07:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
successfully over the years
 
07:56:10.310 --> 07:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
and this is simply tapping into uh that
 
07:56:12.868 --> 07:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
existing statute by providing additional
 
07:56:15.430 --> 07:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
periods of relief for uh workforce
 
07:56:15.440 --> 07:56:16.468 align:start position:0%
periods of relief for uh workforce
housing

07:56:16.468 --> 07:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
housing
 
07:56:17.830 --> 07:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
and then again
 
07:56:20.388 --> 07:56:20.398 align:start position:0%
remind you this is at the municipality's
 
07:56:23.750 --> 07:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
discretion it says up to
 
07:56:26.070 --> 07:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
that is the local governing board body's
 
07:56:29.270 --> 07:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
decision to make on each individual case
 
07:56:31.910 --> 07:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
so they might say no in this case
 
07:56:34.230 --> 07:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
because of whatever reasons they they
 
07:56:36.310 --> 07:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
determine we're only going to give you
 
07:56:38.788 --> 07:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
four years of additional relief or six
 
07:56:40.628 --> 07:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
years or the eight years that the
 
07:56:43.270 --> 07:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
statute allows it is a decision that
 
07:56:46.230 --> 07:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
each local governing body would make on
 
07:56:48.230 --> 07:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
an individualized basis when presented
 
07:56:50.468 --> 07:56:50.478 align:start position:0%
with an application
 
07:56:53.990 --> 07:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:55.830 --> 07:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore got to your
 
07:56:55.840 --> 07:56:57.270 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore got to your
question

07:56:57.270 --> 07:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:57:00.708 --> 07:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
the duration of the affordability so
 
07:57:02.548 --> 07:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
07:57:02.558 --> 07:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
let's say
a

07:57:03.910 --> 07:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:57:05.670 --> 07:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
property owner is doing workforce
 
07:57:08.388 --> 07:57:08.398 align:start position:0%
housing approaches the select board for
 
07:57:12.070 --> 07:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
tax relief under rsa 79e
 
07:57:12.080 --> 07:57:13.190 align:start position:0%
tax relief under rsa 79e
and

07:57:13.190 --> 07:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:57:14.388 --> 07:57:14.398 align:start position:0%
how long
 
07:57:17.750 --> 07:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
would that property be workforce housing
 
07:57:20.948 --> 07:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
rsa 79d does have a provision on this
 
07:57:24.150 --> 07:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to workforce housing
 
07:57:24.160 --> 07:57:25.030 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to workforce housing
but

07:57:25.030 --> 07:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:57:27.670 --> 07:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
but is uh related to the
 
07:57:29.510 --> 07:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
what's called the public benefit
 
07:57:32.948 --> 07:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
covenant so in order for a municipality
 
07:57:36.388 --> 07:57:36.398 align:start position:0%
to award this tax relief uh the select
 
07:57:38.310 --> 07:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
board the local governing body has to
 
07:57:40.388 --> 07:57:40.398 align:start position:0%
find that there is a public benefit
 
07:57:42.150 --> 07:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
and then there has to be a covenant that
 
07:57:44.388 --> 07:57:44.398 align:start position:0%
gets recorded in the registry of deeds
 
07:57:46.628 --> 07:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
recognizing that public benefit
 
07:57:49.590 --> 07:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that places limitations on the use
 
07:57:52.230 --> 07:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the property so the public benefit
 
07:57:52.240 --> 07:57:53.430 align:start position:0%
of the property so the public benefit
covenant

07:57:53.430 --> 07:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
covenant
 
07:57:53.440 --> 07:57:54.388 align:start position:0%
covenant
can

07:57:54.388 --> 07:57:54.398 align:start position:0%
can
 
07:57:56.388 --> 07:57:56.398 align:start position:0%
this is again another discretionary
 
07:57:56.398 --> 07:57:57.910 align:start position:0%
this is again another discretionary
question

07:57:57.910 --> 07:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:57:59.910 --> 07:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
can last for up to
 
07:58:02.468 --> 07:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
twice the length of the tax relief that
 
07:58:03.670 --> 07:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
is granted
 
07:58:03.680 --> 07:58:04.388 align:start position:0%
is granted
so

07:58:04.388 --> 07:58:04.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:58:04.398 --> 07:58:05.590 align:start position:0%
so
if

07:58:05.590 --> 07:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:58:08.230 --> 07:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
through whatever combination of factors
 
07:58:11.110 --> 07:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
a property gets say 10 years of tax
 
07:58:13.510 --> 07:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
relief under 79e whether it's whether
 
07:58:15.670 --> 07:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's under the provisions in
 
07:58:18.868 --> 07:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
senegal 400 or the existing statute as
 
07:58:21.270 --> 07:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
it exists at this time
 
07:58:23.590 --> 07:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
the municipality could
 
07:58:26.708 --> 07:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
require the public benefit covenant
 
07:58:29.350 --> 07:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
to last for a period of 20 years
 
07:58:31.430 --> 07:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that could be a term of
 
07:58:33.430 --> 07:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
affordability for workforce housing
 
07:58:39.030 --> 07:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
recognize too that if a developer were
 
07:58:40.548 --> 07:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
pursuing a
 
07:58:42.948 --> 07:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
an application through a local planning
 
07:58:45.350 --> 07:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
board for workforce housing and at the
 
07:58:47.910 --> 07:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
same time seeking tax relief uh through
 
07:58:50.070 --> 07:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
the select board the planning board
 
07:58:51.670 --> 07:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
could also impose long-term
 
07:58:54.548 --> 07:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
affordability covenants as a an approval
 
07:58:57.030 --> 07:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
of workforce housing and those typically
 
07:58:59.030 --> 07:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
are on the order of
 
07:58:59.040 --> 07:59:00.150 align:start position:0%
are on the order of
30

07:59:00.150 --> 07:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
30
 
07:59:01.750 --> 07:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
20 30 years
 
07:59:04.230 --> 07:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
some municipalities do perpetuity which
 
07:59:07.110 --> 07:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
is an awfully long time
 
07:59:10.150 --> 07:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
if they're if a development is seeking
 
07:59:12.310 --> 07:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
public funding through say my employer
 
07:59:13.750 --> 07:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing
 
07:59:15.910 --> 07:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
we require long-term affordability
 
07:59:18.070 --> 07:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
generally no less than 30 years of
 
07:59:20.868 --> 07:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
affordability sometimes 40 sometimes 60
 
07:59:23.110 --> 07:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
years sometimes longer depending upon
 
07:59:25.430 --> 07:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
the mix of financing so there is there
 
07:59:27.190 --> 07:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity to keep these
 
07:59:29.510 --> 07:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
properties affordable for a long period
 
07:59:32.388 --> 07:59:32.398 align:start position:0%
of time but it does require
 
07:59:32.398 --> 07:59:33.350 align:start position:0%
of time but it does require
action

07:59:33.350 --> 07:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
action
 
07:59:35.830 --> 07:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level or through a
 
07:59:35.840 --> 07:59:37.590 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level or through a
funder

07:59:37.590 --> 07:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
funder
 
07:59:41.510 --> 07:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:41.520 --> 07:59:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:59:42.788 --> 07:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:59:44.868 --> 07:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
and mr vice chairman you had asked
 
07:59:46.868 --> 07:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
what's the maximum period of time you
 
07:59:48.150 --> 07:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
can get relief
 
07:59:52.150 --> 07:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
under under the current statute
 
07:59:54.708 --> 07:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
the base period of relief of
 
07:59:58.070 --> 07:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
affordability is up to five years
 
08:00:00.788 --> 08:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
and then if you're doing additional
 
08:00:02.708 --> 08:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
housing units you can get an additional
 
08:00:04.468 --> 08:00:04.478 align:start position:0%
two years if they're affordable an
 
08:00:06.708 --> 08:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
additional four years if it's an
 
08:00:10.310 --> 08:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
historic structure i think an additional
 
08:00:13.430 --> 08:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
four years i think the total possible
 
08:00:17.270 --> 08:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
maximum right now is 13 years
 
08:00:17.280 --> 08:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
maximum right now is 13 years
again

08:00:18.230 --> 08:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
08:00:20.628 --> 08:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's up to the select word to decide
 
08:00:22.468 --> 08:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
are we going to grant it for that period
 
08:00:24.788 --> 08:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
of time
 
08:00:25.830 --> 08:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
this would
 
08:00:25.840 --> 08:00:26.868 align:start position:0%
this would
add

08:00:26.868 --> 08:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
add
 
08:00:29.190 --> 08:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
to those those periods uh so an
 
08:00:32.628 --> 08:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
additional four years uh for uh
 
08:00:35.030 --> 08:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
workforce housing if you will so
 
08:00:37.830 --> 08:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
i guess 17 years would be the total
 
08:00:39.350 --> 08:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
08:00:46.468 --> 08:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:48.548 --> 08:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
online thank you mr frosting thank you
 
08:00:50.468 --> 08:00:50.478 align:start position:0%
mr chief if you want me to ask a
 
08:00:50.478 --> 08:00:51.430 align:start position:0%
mr chief if you want me to ask a
question

08:00:51.430 --> 08:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:00:54.070 --> 08:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
um it gives an additional eight years
 
08:00:56.388 --> 08:00:56.398 align:start position:0%
for a project that includes affordable
 
08:00:58.230 --> 08:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
housing that meets the definition of
 
08:00:59.910 --> 08:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
workforce housing
 
08:01:01.750 --> 08:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
and up to an additional eight years for
 
08:01:03.350 --> 08:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
a project that includes residential
 
08:01:06.468 --> 08:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
units so are they not calculating 16
 
08:01:11.910 --> 08:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:14.070 --> 08:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
potentially yes uh
 
08:01:16.230 --> 08:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
again up to the local select board to
 
08:01:19.110 --> 08:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
decide is is this good for our community
 
08:01:21.430 --> 08:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh and they might say no you're not
 
08:01:22.830 --> 08:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna give you that
 
08:01:25.910 --> 08:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
much more followers go ahead
 
08:01:28.468 --> 08:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
they are the amount of money that
 
08:01:28.478 --> 08:01:29.430 align:start position:0%
they are the amount of money that
that

08:01:29.430 --> 08:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:01:31.030 --> 08:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
08:01:32.468 --> 08:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
is there any way to determine that
 
08:01:34.388 --> 08:01:34.398 align:start position:0%
because that to me it sounds like it's a
 
08:01:36.788 --> 08:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money and the taxpayers
 
08:01:38.628 --> 08:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
are going to if that goes through a huge
 
08:01:40.150 --> 08:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
amount of money taxpayers are going to
 
08:01:41.990 --> 08:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to come up with
 
08:01:44.230 --> 08:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
and you know do you have a percentage or
 
08:01:44.240 --> 08:01:45.030 align:start position:0%
and you know do you have a percentage or
anything

08:01:45.030 --> 08:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
08:01:46.948 --> 08:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
along those lines that
 
08:01:49.030 --> 08:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
would give us an idea
 
08:01:51.030 --> 08:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great question mr vice chairman
 
08:01:53.190 --> 08:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that there have been
 
08:01:54.868 --> 08:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
analyses done
 
08:01:54.878 --> 08:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
analyses done
like

08:01:55.990 --> 08:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:01:57.510 --> 08:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
08:02:01.350 --> 08:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
the use of rsa 79e over the years
 
08:02:03.030 --> 08:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
but you could
 
08:02:05.510 --> 08:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis i think very
 
08:02:05.520 --> 08:02:06.468 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis i think very
easily

08:02:06.468 --> 08:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
easily
 
08:02:09.750 --> 08:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
calculate what the attack shift would be
 
08:02:11.990 --> 08:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
and you'd look at the number of years
 
08:02:13.510 --> 08:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
you you could very easily come up with
 
08:02:15.190 --> 08:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
that number on each individual
 
08:02:15.200 --> 08:02:16.548 align:start position:0%
that number on each individual
application

08:02:16.548 --> 08:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
application
 
08:02:18.548 --> 08:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
and it's similar to what representative
 
08:02:20.948 --> 08:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
power was asking what's the what's the
 
08:02:22.948 --> 08:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
the aggregate that a municipality might
 
08:02:25.190 --> 08:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
be looking at but it does require some
 
08:02:27.830 --> 08:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
individual decision making from property
 
08:02:30.070 --> 08:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
owners approaching a select board and
 
08:02:31.510 --> 08:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
then the select board making those
 
08:02:31.520 --> 08:02:32.788 align:start position:0%
then the select board making those
decisions

08:02:32.788 --> 08:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
08:02:36.150 --> 08:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
and again i want to emphasize this is
 
08:02:38.548 --> 08:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
all discretionary and the local
 
08:02:41.750 --> 08:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
governing body can do decide to do less
 
08:02:41.760 --> 08:02:42.948 align:start position:0%
governing body can do decide to do less
than

08:02:42.948 --> 08:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
than
 
08:02:45.190 --> 08:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
what the statute authorizes
 
08:02:47.190 --> 08:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
both in presenting
 
08:02:50.388 --> 08:02:50.398 align:start position:0%
a warrant article and in making the
 
08:02:53.190 --> 08:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
individual specific decisions
 
08:02:56.868 --> 08:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:58.788 --> 08:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
then you had a question from uh
 
08:03:01.190 --> 08:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative lasallis
 
08:03:03.590 --> 08:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
08:03:05.750 --> 08:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned a
 
08:03:07.990 --> 08:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
couple of statistics about
 
08:03:09.350 --> 08:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh people
 
08:03:13.030 --> 08:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
coming into the state uh from uh
 
08:03:17.590 --> 08:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and so forth
 
08:03:19.750 --> 08:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
08:03:19.760 --> 08:03:21.430 align:start position:0%
in the case of
a

08:03:21.430 --> 08:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
08:03:23.750 --> 08:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
family from massachusetts
 
08:03:28.628 --> 08:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
who had a vacation home or a second home
 
08:03:30.388 --> 08:03:30.398 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
08:03:30.398 --> 08:03:31.270 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
who

08:03:31.270 --> 08:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
08:03:34.548 --> 08:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
now maybe they're not retiring
 
08:03:34.558 --> 08:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
now maybe they're not retiring
but

08:03:35.350 --> 08:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:03:38.310 --> 08:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:41.190 --> 08:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
zoom the new zoom era
 
08:03:43.270 --> 08:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're not required to live in
 
08:03:43.280 --> 08:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
they're not required to live in
massachusetts

08:03:45.030 --> 08:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
08:03:48.628 --> 08:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
they sell their mansion in massachusetts
 
08:03:52.868 --> 08:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
and downsize to their second home in new
 
08:03:52.878 --> 08:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
and downsize to their second home in new
hampshire

08:03:53.990 --> 08:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:03:56.548 --> 08:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
would your statistics
 
08:04:01.510 --> 08:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:04.070 --> 08:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
08:04:04.080 --> 08:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
um

08:04:05.830 --> 08:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:04:08.788 --> 08:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
the the statistics that i was citing
 
08:04:10.948 --> 08:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
would not pick that up
 
08:04:13.430 --> 08:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
and and it's a great question because
 
08:04:15.590 --> 08:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's some it's a phenomenon that we do
 
08:04:15.600 --> 08:04:16.788 align:start position:0%
it's some it's a phenomenon that we do
recognize

08:04:16.788 --> 08:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
08:04:19.670 --> 08:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
it is happening it it it is happening we
 
08:04:20.868 --> 08:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
08:04:24.150 --> 08:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
exactly to what degree it's happening um
 
08:04:26.868 --> 08:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
but we know that there are
 
08:04:28.708 --> 08:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who own second
 
08:04:30.230 --> 08:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
homes in new hampshire who do not live
 
08:04:32.070 --> 08:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
08:04:35.110 --> 08:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
primarily they live in massachusetts
 
08:04:36.628 --> 08:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
08:04:39.190 --> 08:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'd say most of the second homes owned
 
08:04:41.030 --> 08:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are owned by people who
 
08:04:42.948 --> 08:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
live in new hampshire but there's a
 
08:04:44.868 --> 08:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of them owned by
 
08:04:47.190 --> 08:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
people from massachusetts and we do know
 
08:04:47.200 --> 08:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
people from massachusetts and we do know
that

08:04:47.990 --> 08:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:04:50.788 --> 08:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
for a period of time
 
08:04:55.990 --> 08:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
during covet especially during 2020
 
08:04:58.388 --> 08:04:58.398 align:start position:0%
people when their kids
 
08:05:00.548 --> 08:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
were remote learning
 
08:05:02.948 --> 08:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be in their townhouse in
 
08:05:04.628 --> 08:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
waterville valley so the kids were in
 
08:05:05.670 --> 08:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
school in the morning and then they
 
08:05:07.910 --> 08:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
could ski in the afternoon and we saw
 
08:05:09.590 --> 08:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
the impact on the waterville valley
 
08:05:11.590 --> 08:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
school district we saw a similar impact
 
08:05:13.990 --> 08:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
not quite as dramatic in
 
08:05:14.000 --> 08:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
not quite as dramatic in
conway

08:05:16.230 --> 08:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
conway
 
08:05:18.788 --> 08:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
but those impacts this year last year
 
08:05:21.350 --> 08:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
and this year have receded
 
08:05:23.270 --> 08:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
i've not looked at the numbers but
 
08:05:25.430 --> 08:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that's what i've heard that
 
08:05:27.430 --> 08:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing so much of that
 
08:05:28.868 --> 08:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
especially as
 
08:05:30.708 --> 08:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
the kids are going back to school
 
08:05:33.190 --> 08:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
physically in massachusetts they they're
 
08:05:34.628 --> 08:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
only coming up on the weekends instead
 
08:05:36.230 --> 08:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
of living there you know months at a
 
08:05:36.240 --> 08:05:38.948 align:start position:0%
of living there you know months at a
time

08:05:38.948 --> 08:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:38.958 --> 08:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
we

08:05:39.750 --> 08:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
08:05:42.150 --> 08:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
what we've been tracking and we do have
 
08:05:44.310 --> 08:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
very good numbers on this
 
08:05:44.320 --> 08:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
very good numbers on this
is

08:05:45.270 --> 08:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:05:45.280 --> 08:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
is
the

08:05:46.310 --> 08:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:05:49.350 --> 08:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
proportion of people who are buying
 
08:05:51.750 --> 08:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
homes in new hampshire and where they're
 
08:05:55.270 --> 08:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
coming from so we we look at the actual
 
08:05:57.190 --> 08:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
deed transactions
 
08:06:00.150 --> 08:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
and so every deed that gets recorded
 
08:06:02.708 --> 08:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
we're analyzing and figuring out where
 
08:06:04.948 --> 08:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
people are coming from and there has
 
08:06:04.958 --> 08:06:06.468 align:start position:0%
people are coming from and there has
been

08:06:06.468 --> 08:06:06.478 align:start position:0%
been
 
08:06:06.478 --> 08:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
been
since

08:06:07.510 --> 08:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
since
 
08:06:10.708 --> 08:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
20 the beginning of 2020 there has been
 
08:06:13.430 --> 08:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
an increase in the proportion of buyers
 
08:06:15.430 --> 08:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts
 
08:06:18.628 --> 08:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
shifting from about
 
08:06:22.070 --> 08:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
15 percent of all buyers to about 20
 
08:06:24.628 --> 08:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
percent of all buyers
 
08:06:27.350 --> 08:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
but still the vast bulk of buyers in new
 
08:06:29.830 --> 08:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire are already here they're
 
08:06:31.670 --> 08:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're moving from one place in
 
08:06:34.468 --> 08:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to another place
 
08:06:36.310 --> 08:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
but you're that was not your question
 
08:06:38.388 --> 08:06:38.398 align:start position:0%
your question was about you know people
 
08:06:40.628 --> 08:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
who already owned a home here in new
 
08:06:42.708 --> 08:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire but weren't currently living
 
08:06:42.718 --> 08:06:43.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire but weren't currently living
here

08:06:43.510 --> 08:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
08:06:45.590 --> 08:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
those numbers don't account for that
 
08:06:47.350 --> 08:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that the school district
 
08:06:49.910 --> 08:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
information is one way of looking at it
 
08:06:49.920 --> 08:06:50.708 align:start position:0%
information is one way of looking at it
um

08:06:50.708 --> 08:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:06:52.388 --> 08:06:52.398 align:start position:0%
cell phone data is another way of
 
08:06:54.388 --> 08:06:54.398 align:start position:0%
looking at it where you know the where
 
08:06:56.070 --> 08:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
people are making calls from and where
 
08:06:57.590 --> 08:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're where they got their phones
 
08:07:00.468 --> 08:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
originally that's that's one thing
 
08:07:02.230 --> 08:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
credit card transactions is another way
 
08:07:04.070 --> 08:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
of looking at it uh we're not analyzing
 
08:07:06.310 --> 08:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
that but um that's that's one way of
 
08:07:08.150 --> 08:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
doing it it is happening
 
08:07:09.830 --> 08:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's not not in the same degree that i
 
08:07:11.110 --> 08:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people think it's
 
08:07:11.120 --> 08:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people think it's
happening

08:07:13.430 --> 08:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
happening
 
08:07:16.230 --> 08:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh ben i i just i have a
 
08:07:18.150 --> 08:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
small bit of homework for you i can't
 
08:07:19.750 --> 08:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to execute this bill on the
 
08:07:21.590 --> 08:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
18th yes

08:07:23.350 --> 08:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:07:25.590 --> 08:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
i will just ask before we
 
08:07:28.310 --> 08:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
get to the exact meeting if you could
 
08:07:28.320 --> 08:07:29.910 align:start position:0%
get to the exact meeting if you could
help

08:07:29.910 --> 08:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
help
 
08:07:31.350 --> 08:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to belay it right now but
 
08:07:32.708 --> 08:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
the the
 
08:07:33.590 --> 08:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
08:07:34.868 --> 08:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
in the
 
08:07:36.708 --> 08:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
front page of the bill and under the
 
08:07:40.628 --> 08:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:43.190 --> 08:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
how the bill creates incentives
 
08:07:44.788 --> 08:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
08:07:45.830 --> 08:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
could you
 
08:07:47.750 --> 08:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
help point out
 
08:07:49.670 --> 08:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
for the committee what those incentives
 
08:07:51.190 --> 08:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
are and where they are where they are
 
08:07:54.628 --> 08:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:57.510 --> 08:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
i could i could do that right now
 
08:07:57.520 --> 08:07:58.230 align:start position:0%
i could i could do that right now
oh

08:07:58.230 --> 08:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
oh
 
08:07:58.240 --> 08:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
oh
we

08:07:59.110 --> 08:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
08:08:03.110 --> 08:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:04.548 --> 08:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
08:08:07.110 --> 08:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman are you asking for a short
 
08:08:11.750 --> 08:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
memo on each section is that

08:08:25.350 --> 08:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
18th so i'll try to get that to you um
 
08:08:27.510 --> 08:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
by the end of next week
 
08:08:29.270 --> 08:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
and should i just email it to the entire
 
08:08:29.280 --> 08:08:30.468 align:start position:0%
and should i just email it to the entire
committee

08:08:30.468 --> 08:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:08:32.628 --> 08:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that would work okay i'd be
 
08:08:36.788 --> 08:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:39.750 --> 08:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
and it is evening now
 
08:08:42.628 --> 08:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman um
 
08:08:45.830 --> 08:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
mr frost thank you so much um
 
08:08:47.990 --> 08:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't really know if i can explain
 
08:08:49.510 --> 08:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
this clearly
 
08:08:49.520 --> 08:08:50.628 align:start position:0%
this clearly
but

08:08:50.628 --> 08:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:08:53.910 --> 08:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
my impression of workforce housing is
 
08:08:53.920 --> 08:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
my impression of workforce housing is
that

08:08:55.190 --> 08:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:08:57.190 --> 08:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's providing affordable housing for
 
08:08:59.350 --> 08:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
people that are working to support local
 
08:09:01.670 --> 08:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
businesses and it may even be an
 
08:09:03.750 --> 08:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
incentive for businesses to come into
 
08:09:06.468 --> 08:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire because their workers will
 
08:09:09.030 --> 08:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
be able to afford housing
 
08:09:11.990 --> 08:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if we take a small community um and
 
08:09:14.230 --> 08:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna pick on litchfield
 
08:09:16.628 --> 08:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
my my colleague from litchfield it's a
 
08:09:18.548 --> 08:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
rural community it's a wonderful place
 
08:09:21.990 --> 08:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
to live it's close to a lot of business
 
08:09:22.000 --> 08:09:23.750 align:start position:0%
to live it's close to a lot of business
hubs

08:09:23.750 --> 08:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
hubs
 
08:09:27.110 --> 08:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
what incentive do they have to consider
 
08:09:29.270 --> 08:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
the this tool box
 
08:09:30.628 --> 08:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
they can go ahead and build this but
 
08:09:32.310 --> 08:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
businesses are probably not going to go
 
08:09:34.468 --> 08:09:34.478 align:start position:0%
to litchfield so they're going to be
 
08:09:37.430 --> 08:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
providing a benefit to businesses but
 
08:09:40.230 --> 08:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're that's not going to be offset by
 
08:09:42.310 --> 08:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
increased property taxes that would
 
08:09:42.320 --> 08:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
increased property taxes that would
offset

08:09:43.430 --> 08:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
offset
 
08:09:45.350 --> 08:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
the increase in
 
08:09:45.360 --> 08:09:47.190 align:start position:0%
the increase in
residential

08:09:47.190 --> 08:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
residential
 
08:09:48.468 --> 08:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
like i look at
 
08:09:50.150 --> 08:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
i look at the the
 
08:09:51.830 --> 08:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
a town's property
 
08:09:54.548 --> 08:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
the pie the assessment pie
 
08:09:57.350 --> 08:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's an advantage to residential
 
08:09:59.350 --> 08:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
property owners to have business and
 
08:10:01.830 --> 08:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
commercial because they don't require
 
08:10:04.628 --> 08:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
the municipal costs or services that
 
08:10:06.708 --> 08:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
residents do and that's primarily with
 
08:10:06.718 --> 08:10:08.230 align:start position:0%
residents do and that's primarily with
education

08:10:08.230 --> 08:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
08:10:10.548 --> 08:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
so what would incentivize litchfield to
 
08:10:13.590 --> 08:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
participate in this
 
08:10:15.030 --> 08:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
08:10:18.230 --> 08:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's building businesses
 
08:10:20.468 --> 08:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
but yet they're not getting the benefit
 
08:10:21.990 --> 08:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
from that
 
08:10:23.830 --> 08:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
do you see there it's not it's just
 
08:10:26.070 --> 08:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the portion of their pie
 
08:10:28.388 --> 08:10:28.398 align:start position:0%
that's going to residential
 
08:10:30.628 --> 08:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
likely increasing their school dis their
 
08:10:32.070 --> 08:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
school costs
 
08:10:34.150 --> 08:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of my issue and i guess
 
08:10:36.070 --> 08:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a concern with just the way
 
08:10:39.590 --> 08:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
we do things in new hampshire because
 
08:10:42.150 --> 08:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
each town each municipality is not an
 
08:10:42.160 --> 08:10:43.110 align:start position:0%
each town each municipality is not an
island

08:10:43.110 --> 08:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
island
 
08:10:45.430 --> 08:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of people that
 
08:10:47.430 --> 08:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
live in my town that don't work in
 
08:10:47.440 --> 08:10:48.868 align:start position:0%
live in my town that don't work in
merrimack

08:10:48.868 --> 08:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
08:10:50.708 --> 08:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
i mean we have some big employers but
 
08:10:52.388 --> 08:10:52.398 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of people that just
 
08:10:53.830 --> 08:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
get on the highway and go into
 
08:10:56.708 --> 08:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
massachusetts so for merrimack to build
 
08:10:59.270 --> 08:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
more workforce housing
 
08:10:59.280 --> 08:11:00.230 align:start position:0%
more workforce housing
it's

08:11:00.230 --> 08:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
08:11:02.788 --> 08:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's not as likely and less likely than
 
08:11:04.708 --> 08:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
would be in in
 
08:11:06.788 --> 08:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
in litchfield that they would that would
 
08:11:10.310 --> 08:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
be offset by increased commercial
 
08:11:13.590 --> 08:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
industrial tax base
 
08:11:14.788 --> 08:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have an answer but
 
08:11:17.110 --> 08:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's i'm trying to figure out what are
 
08:11:19.030 --> 08:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
these incentives
 
08:11:21.270 --> 08:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
for a town to really invest in
 
08:11:23.990 --> 08:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
increasing residential housing
 
08:11:26.628 --> 08:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
let me follow up on representative
 
08:11:29.830 --> 08:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
wrong's uh question because
 
08:11:31.990 --> 08:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
back in the time when i was working on
 
08:11:34.468 --> 08:11:34.478 align:start position:0%
senator clark's commission
 
08:11:36.628 --> 08:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
08:11:39.110 --> 08:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
real incentives and how do you get
 
08:11:41.590 --> 08:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
communities to step up and say i'm
 
08:11:42.868 --> 08:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
willing to do this because there's some
 
08:11:44.788 --> 08:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
trade-offs here and one of the things
 
08:11:47.110 --> 08:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
that we talked about is some of the most
 
08:11:49.110 --> 08:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
expensive items
 
08:11:50.708 --> 08:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
for communities
 
08:11:52.708 --> 08:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
that are developing
 
08:11:55.110 --> 08:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
is sewer and water
 
08:11:58.150 --> 08:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
so how do we maybe incentivize
 
08:12:00.788 --> 08:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
sewer and water to some of these
 
08:12:02.948 --> 08:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
communities that are looking for it
 
08:12:02.958 --> 08:12:04.230 align:start position:0%
communities that are looking for it
uh

08:12:04.230 --> 08:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:12:06.708 --> 08:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
with with this particular program if if
 
08:12:09.030 --> 08:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
you do this then
 
08:12:11.830 --> 08:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
you'll get that benefit
 
08:12:15.190 --> 08:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
well let me turn to
 
08:12:17.990 --> 08:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is a great philosophical question
 
08:12:19.350 --> 08:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and
 
08:12:20.788 --> 08:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
you know we could spend
 
08:12:22.868 --> 08:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
days we could you could do a
 
08:12:24.708 --> 08:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
dissertation on this
 
08:12:26.230 --> 08:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
but let's just
 
08:12:29.110 --> 08:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
in response to the chairs prompt
 
08:12:30.708 --> 08:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
let's turn to
 
08:12:30.718 --> 08:12:38.310 align:start position:0%
let's turn to
um

08:12:38.310 --> 08:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:41.670 --> 08:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:42.948 --> 08:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
this is the housing champion
 
08:12:42.958 --> 08:12:46.468 align:start position:0%
this is the housing champion
certification

08:12:46.468 --> 08:12:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:50.388 --> 08:12:50.398 align:start position:0%
lines 34 35.
 
08:12:52.788 --> 08:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
municipality shall receive preferential
 
08:12:54.708 --> 08:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
access to state resources including but
 
08:12:56.548 --> 08:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
not limited to discretionary state
 
08:12:58.868 --> 08:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds as available water
 
08:13:02.150 --> 08:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
and sewer so communities that are
 
08:13:02.160 --> 08:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
and sewer so communities that are
open

08:13:03.110 --> 08:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
open
 
08:13:06.150 --> 08:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
to housing development that seek a
 
08:13:08.310 --> 08:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
housing champion certification
 
08:13:11.430 --> 08:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
have that that leg up in getting access
 
08:13:13.590 --> 08:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
to the water and sewer that is needed to
 
08:13:16.388 --> 08:13:16.398 align:start position:0%
support the housing development they go
 
08:13:18.868 --> 08:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
hand in hand it's connected they do it's
 
08:13:21.510 --> 08:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
a nexus there that we have to recognize
 
08:13:23.510 --> 08:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is a very clear nexus
 
08:13:25.430 --> 08:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
and again
 
08:13:27.030 --> 08:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
not everything here is going to be
 
08:13:29.190 --> 08:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
applicable to every community
 
08:13:31.990 --> 08:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm very familiar with litchfield i
 
08:13:33.510 --> 08:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
used to work for the nashua regional
 
08:13:35.590 --> 08:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
planning commission and you know i know
 
08:13:37.510 --> 08:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
i know what the town is like
 
08:13:37.520 --> 08:13:38.388 align:start position:0%
i know what the town is like
um

08:13:38.388 --> 08:13:38.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:13:40.468 --> 08:13:40.478 align:start position:0%
and you know what works in litchfield
 
08:13:43.270 --> 08:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
might be something very different from
 
08:13:44.948 --> 08:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
from what works in its neighbor
 
08:13:44.958 --> 08:13:46.628 align:start position:0%
from what works in its neighbor
londonderry

08:13:46.628 --> 08:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
08:13:48.708 --> 08:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
you know it might be looking at some
 
08:13:51.030 --> 08:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
really small scale commercial
 
08:13:53.750 --> 08:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
development which in fact
 
08:13:56.388 --> 08:13:56.398 align:start position:0%
may be the best return for the
 
08:13:59.510 --> 08:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
municipality for a place like litchfield
 
08:14:02.070 --> 08:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of tax revenue not the big
 
08:14:02.080 --> 08:14:03.350 align:start position:0%
in terms of tax revenue not the big
projects

08:14:03.350 --> 08:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
projects
 
08:14:05.830 --> 08:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
but the iterative small-scale commercial
 
08:14:05.840 --> 08:14:06.868 align:start position:0%
but the iterative small-scale commercial
projects

08:14:06.868 --> 08:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
projects
 
08:14:08.070 --> 08:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
08:14:09.510 --> 08:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we have actually new hampshire
 
08:14:10.868 --> 08:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
housing has
 
08:14:12.310 --> 08:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
08:14:14.948 --> 08:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
a really interesting consultant called
 
08:14:17.190 --> 08:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
urban three don't let the name get in
 
08:14:19.670 --> 08:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
the way of of your perceptions but what
 
08:14:21.590 --> 08:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
they look at
 
08:14:21.600 --> 08:14:23.270 align:start position:0%
they look at
is

08:14:23.270 --> 08:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:14:25.190 --> 08:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
the tax revenues that go to
 
08:14:27.750 --> 08:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities based on different types
 
08:14:30.628 --> 08:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
of land uses and we just we completed
 
08:14:32.548 --> 08:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
the first phase of the study last year
 
08:14:34.628 --> 08:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's on our website
 
08:14:36.230 --> 08:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
and we
 
08:14:38.310 --> 08:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
had them work with 15 different new
 
08:14:40.070 --> 08:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipalities all over the
 
08:14:42.310 --> 08:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
state different types of municipalities
 
08:14:45.270 --> 08:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know cities small towns
 
08:14:45.280 --> 08:14:46.388 align:start position:0%
you know cities small towns
and

08:14:46.388 --> 08:14:46.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:14:48.708 --> 08:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
when in each one of them what they found
 
08:14:48.718 --> 08:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
when in each one of them what they found
was

08:14:49.590 --> 08:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
08:14:51.910 --> 08:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
as expected
 
08:14:55.110 --> 08:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
the the best return for
 
08:14:58.230 --> 08:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
tax revenue was on the small scale
 
08:15:00.708 --> 08:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
mixed-use development so
 
08:15:03.990 --> 08:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
the highest return in dover for example
 
08:15:04.000 --> 08:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
the highest return in dover for example
was

08:15:05.830 --> 08:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
08:15:09.990 --> 08:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
a pizza shop with two apartments over it
 
08:15:12.948 --> 08:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of the use of land
 
08:15:14.948 --> 08:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
and the return and taxes on that
 
08:15:14.958 --> 08:15:16.548 align:start position:0%
and the return and taxes on that
property

08:15:16.548 --> 08:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
property
 
08:15:18.708 --> 08:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know walmart generates a lot of
 
08:15:22.388 --> 08:15:22.398 align:start position:0%
taxes but it consumes a lot of land too
 
08:15:24.948 --> 08:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
so it's not an efficient from a property
 
08:15:27.430 --> 08:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
tax standpoint it's not an efficient use
 
08:15:29.270 --> 08:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
of land
 
08:15:31.270 --> 08:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
you get a much more efficient use of
 
08:15:34.388 --> 08:15:34.398 align:start position:0%
land returning on taxes on the
 
08:15:36.708 --> 08:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
to the municipality from the small scale
 
08:15:38.468 --> 08:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
stuff that might be the best thing for a
 
08:15:40.468 --> 08:15:40.478 align:start position:0%
place like litchfield
 
08:15:41.910 --> 08:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
08:15:42.948 --> 08:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
that would
 
08:15:42.958 --> 08:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
that would
support

08:15:43.990 --> 08:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
08:15:46.628 --> 08:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh that small scale housing development
 
08:15:50.308 --> 08:15:50.318 align:start position:0%
and if they like like lines 34 and 35
 
08:15:55.190 --> 08:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:57.030 --> 08:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
08:15:59.350 --> 08:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
08:16:01.750 --> 08:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you to my colleague for bringing
 
08:16:01.760 --> 08:16:02.788 align:start position:0%
thank you to my colleague for bringing
up

08:16:02.788 --> 08:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
up
 
08:16:05.670 --> 08:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
the town of litchfield because i think
 
08:16:06.948 --> 08:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
08:16:09.190 --> 08:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
although it's kind of unique
 
08:16:12.548 --> 08:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
in a way but yet it's typical in some
 
08:16:18.830 --> 08:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
ways also i recently did an analysis of
 
08:16:20.708 --> 08:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
08:16:22.948 --> 08:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative run talked about as far
 
08:16:26.230 --> 08:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
as litchfield it is totally a bedroom
 
08:16:29.110 --> 08:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
community there's almost nobody who
 
08:16:32.628 --> 08:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
works within with a few exceptions
 
08:16:35.670 --> 08:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
very few people
 
08:16:38.468 --> 08:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
work in litchfield that live in
 
08:16:40.388 --> 08:16:40.398 align:start position:0%
litchfield but
 
08:16:42.388 --> 08:16:42.398 align:start position:0%
it's surrounded
 
08:16:45.190 --> 08:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
by some of the largest communities in
 
08:16:46.548 --> 08:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
the state
 
08:16:51.110 --> 08:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
manchester bedford londonderry hudson
 
08:16:54.308 --> 08:16:54.318 align:start position:0%
nashua merrimack all right
 
08:16:57.430 --> 08:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
almost a quarter of the population of
 
08:16:58.788 --> 08:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
08:17:01.830 --> 08:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
can be reached from litchfield within 10
 
08:17:01.840 --> 08:17:02.868 align:start position:0%
can be reached from litchfield within 10
minutes

08:17:02.868 --> 08:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
08:17:03.990 --> 08:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
08:17:07.270 --> 08:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
and but yet we have no commercial we
 
08:17:10.468 --> 08:17:10.478 align:start position:0%
have no sewer we have
 
08:17:13.830 --> 08:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
no water there's two things that people
 
08:17:16.868 --> 08:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
in litchfield
 
08:17:19.830 --> 08:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
are would be against any sort of
 
08:17:23.430 --> 08:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
workforce housing one is to
 
08:17:23.440 --> 08:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
workforce housing one is to
maintain

08:17:25.510 --> 08:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
08:17:25.520 --> 08:17:26.388 align:start position:0%
maintain
the

08:17:26.388 --> 08:17:26.398 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:17:29.510 --> 08:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
bucolic nature of the town
 
08:17:32.788 --> 08:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
and secondly is the fear
 
08:17:36.070 --> 08:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
of being inundated by kids in the school
 
08:17:36.080 --> 08:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
of being inundated by kids in the school
system

08:17:37.270 --> 08:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
08:17:39.830 --> 08:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
those two things keep us from
 
08:17:41.350 --> 08:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
08:17:42.308 --> 08:17:42.318 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
08:17:45.830 --> 08:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
a little sewer and and affordable water
 
08:17:49.110 --> 08:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
we have water but it's not affordable
 
08:17:51.510 --> 08:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right it's like gold
 
08:17:51.520 --> 08:17:52.628 align:start position:0%
all right it's like gold
um

08:17:52.628 --> 08:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:17:52.638 --> 08:17:53.910 align:start position:0%
um
but

08:17:53.910 --> 08:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:17:55.910 --> 08:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if there's a question in
 
08:17:57.750 --> 08:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
there i'll i'll take it as a question if
 
08:17:59.910 --> 08:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
i may reply okay um
 
08:18:02.150 --> 08:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
08:18:02.160 --> 08:18:03.990 align:start position:0%
i i think that
um

08:18:03.990 --> 08:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:18:06.308 --> 08:18:06.318 align:start position:0%
again i'll repeat
 
08:18:09.270 --> 08:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's in this legislation is tools for
 
08:18:12.548 --> 08:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use
 
08:18:15.670 --> 08:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
if they want to and i understand exactly
 
08:18:17.030 --> 08:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
what um
 
08:18:19.030 --> 08:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
the folks in litchfield are thinking
 
08:18:21.190 --> 08:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
about one thing i would encourage you to
 
08:18:22.868 --> 08:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
do is
 
08:18:22.878 --> 08:18:23.670 align:start position:0%
do is
to

08:18:23.670 --> 08:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:18:27.270 --> 08:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
question the assertion that
 
08:18:28.708 --> 08:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
new housing
 
08:18:32.070 --> 08:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
automatically brings brings a flood of
 
08:18:33.750 --> 08:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
school-aged children
 
08:18:33.760 --> 08:18:34.788 align:start position:0%
school-aged children
we've

08:18:34.788 --> 08:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
we've
 
08:18:36.948 --> 08:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
done plenty of studies on this they're
 
08:18:38.388 --> 08:18:38.398 align:start position:0%
available on the new hampshire housing
 
08:18:40.948 --> 08:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
website where we've looked at
 
08:18:43.350 --> 08:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
new residential development in different
 
08:18:45.270 --> 08:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire communities
 
08:18:45.280 --> 08:18:46.150 align:start position:0%
new hampshire communities
and

08:18:46.150 --> 08:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:18:48.948 --> 08:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
the numbers of school-aged children that
 
08:18:50.788 --> 08:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
that new residential development
 
08:18:50.798 --> 08:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
that new residential development
generates

08:18:51.990 --> 08:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
generates
 
08:18:55.430 --> 08:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is a lot lower than most people think
 
08:19:00.308 --> 08:19:00.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:02.868 --> 08:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
but the wreck we recognize that
 
08:19:05.590 --> 08:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the school population has
 
08:19:07.670 --> 08:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
certain costs
 
08:19:09.350 --> 08:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
those costs and i would encourage you
 
08:19:11.910 --> 08:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
also to look at a study that
 
08:19:14.708 --> 08:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
unh's doc dr richard england did
 
08:19:16.388 --> 08:19:16.398 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
08:19:20.230 --> 08:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
the costs are not linear
 
08:19:22.788 --> 08:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
they they are quantum jumps so you have
 
08:19:24.788 --> 08:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
a certain capacity and most you know a
 
08:19:26.628 --> 08:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of the costs that
 
08:19:29.510 --> 08:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
are born in your uh
 
08:19:32.150 --> 08:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
represented in your school tax bill are
 
08:19:34.308 --> 08:19:34.318 align:start position:0%
capital costs that are not going to
 
08:19:34.318 --> 08:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
capital costs that are not going to
change

08:19:35.270 --> 08:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
change
 
08:19:37.750 --> 08:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
when the population changes until you
 
08:19:39.910 --> 08:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
get to a critical point where you need
 
08:19:43.670 --> 08:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
to expand or rehabilitate
 
08:19:46.788 --> 08:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
where you're talking about shifts of 20
 
08:19:49.030 --> 08:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
or 30 students
 
08:19:50.868 --> 08:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a perceptible
 
08:19:53.430 --> 08:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
change to your school tax bill ben i'm
 
08:19:55.990 --> 08:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to uh at the
 
08:19:59.350 --> 08:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
risk of frustrating you i'm going to
 
08:20:01.990 --> 08:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
do some rearranging here in real time i
 
08:20:04.708 --> 08:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
am at your disposal uh well that's good
 
08:20:06.468 --> 08:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you to be our final
 
08:20:06.478 --> 08:20:09.510 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you to be our final
speaker

08:20:09.510 --> 08:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:11.910 --> 08:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that way those who want to hang
 
08:20:13.910 --> 08:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
around and listen
 
08:20:15.350 --> 08:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
we can do that but i'm afraid we're
 
08:20:16.788 --> 08:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
going to start losing more and more
 
08:20:18.948 --> 08:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
committee members and audience
 
08:20:21.190 --> 08:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh as time goes on here and i'm happy to
 
08:20:23.910 --> 08:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
step back mr trump so uh so let me let
 
08:20:25.510 --> 08:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
me go through some of these pink cards
 
08:20:26.948 --> 08:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
and then we'll see where we are and
 
08:20:30.308 --> 08:20:30.318 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to you at the end
 
08:20:42.788 --> 08:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:46.788 --> 08:20:46.798 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
08:21:08.308 --> 08:21:08.318 align:start position:0%
and i've handed out to you the position
 
08:21:10.150 --> 08:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the organization
 
08:21:13.030 --> 08:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill they're we or
 
08:21:15.190 --> 08:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
they are opposed to it
 
08:21:15.200 --> 08:21:16.388 align:start position:0%
they are opposed to it
um

08:21:16.388 --> 08:21:16.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:21:16.398 --> 08:21:17.350 align:start position:0%
um
for

08:21:17.350 --> 08:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
08:21:21.270 --> 08:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
just sort of simple um
 
08:21:24.070 --> 08:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
it it interferes with local control that
 
08:21:25.830 --> 08:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of but there's a lot more
 
08:21:28.628 --> 08:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
detail on this paper you can read it
 
08:21:31.510 --> 08:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
i also want to speak to the bill
 
08:21:33.510 --> 08:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
on my own
 
08:21:35.830 --> 08:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the planning board of
 
08:21:38.708 --> 08:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
epsom i've been elected i think three
 
08:21:41.670 --> 08:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
times possibly four i can't remember
 
08:21:41.680 --> 08:21:43.350 align:start position:0%
times possibly four i can't remember
and

08:21:43.350 --> 08:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:21:46.948 --> 08:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
i've certainly seen our planning board
 
08:21:51.510 --> 08:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
do things that add costs i mean
 
08:21:53.910 --> 08:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
delay people
 
08:21:56.230 --> 08:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
mess with their plans all that sort of
 
08:21:56.240 --> 08:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
mess with their plans all that sort of
stuff

08:21:57.190 --> 08:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
08:21:58.788 --> 08:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
and so
 
08:22:00.948 --> 08:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
just in general
 
08:22:04.308 --> 08:22:04.318 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of
 
08:22:06.468 --> 08:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
some of the things in this bill
 
08:22:08.868 --> 08:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
that help planning boards
 
08:22:11.350 --> 08:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
be more efficient
 
08:22:12.708 --> 08:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
act quicker
 
08:22:16.230 --> 08:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:19.190 --> 08:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
be fairer all that sort of stuff
 
08:22:21.270 --> 08:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
but in reading this bill
 
08:22:23.670 --> 08:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's it feels to me
 
08:22:23.680 --> 08:22:24.948 align:start position:0%
it's it feels to me
like

08:22:24.948 --> 08:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:22:27.030 --> 08:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of different bills pasted
 
08:22:27.040 --> 08:22:28.388 align:start position:0%
a couple of different bills pasted
together

08:22:28.388 --> 08:22:28.398 align:start position:0%
together
 
08:22:30.788 --> 08:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
the first few pages the first four or
 
08:22:33.670 --> 08:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
five pages are of the character that i
 
08:22:36.308 --> 08:22:36.318 align:start position:0%
just described they seem to
 
08:22:39.270 --> 08:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
tighten up the what planning boards can
 
08:22:42.308 --> 08:22:42.318 align:start position:0%
do what what towns do
 
08:22:44.628 --> 08:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
and make it fairer and simpler and
 
08:22:46.548 --> 08:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
quicker and all those kind of things so
 
08:22:49.670 --> 08:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
in general i'm in favor of the the first
 
08:22:51.190 --> 08:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill
 
08:22:53.670 --> 08:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
but then it starts to get into
 
08:22:55.590 --> 08:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
things where
 
08:22:57.510 --> 08:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
it starts to
 
08:23:00.468 --> 08:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
give give ways of pushing people to use
 
08:23:01.990 --> 08:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
their property
 
08:23:05.030 --> 08:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
in ways that the state likes okay and
 
08:23:06.628 --> 08:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
that's where i think it goes off the
 
08:23:09.910 --> 08:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
rails and in particular especially that
 
08:23:12.150 --> 08:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
that last section where it creates some
 
08:23:14.070 --> 08:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
kind of um
 
08:23:14.080 --> 08:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
kind of um
um

08:23:15.510 --> 08:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:23:17.910 --> 08:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
housing champion certification i mean
 
08:23:20.948 --> 08:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
that's just silly stuff um
 
08:23:20.958 --> 08:23:22.388 align:start position:0%
that's just silly stuff um
and

08:23:22.388 --> 08:23:22.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:23:22.398 --> 08:23:23.190 align:start position:0%
and
so

08:23:23.190 --> 08:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:23:26.628 --> 08:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
in general i mean i go back to to the
 
08:23:29.910 --> 08:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
first principles here um
 
08:23:32.070 --> 08:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
in general the people who should control
 
08:23:35.030 --> 08:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
the use of property are the ones that
 
08:23:37.910 --> 08:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
own that property maintain that property
 
08:23:40.868 --> 08:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
pay taxes on that property and so on it
 
08:23:41.910 --> 08:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
08:23:44.230 --> 08:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
the neighbors of people who own property
 
08:23:46.708 --> 08:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
and pay taxes and maintain property
 
08:23:48.468 --> 08:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
right and if it shouldn't be the
 
08:23:50.070 --> 08:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors of those people well it
 
08:23:52.388 --> 08:23:52.398 align:start position:0%
certainly shouldn't be the legislature
 
08:23:52.398 --> 08:23:53.830 align:start position:0%
certainly shouldn't be the legislature
either

08:23:53.830 --> 08:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
08:23:56.628 --> 08:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
right the the legislature should let
 
08:23:59.110 --> 08:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
people use their property the way they
 
08:24:01.190 --> 08:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
want and if if
 
08:24:03.270 --> 08:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
housing is expensive
 
08:24:05.030 --> 08:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature needs to look in the
 
08:24:08.868 --> 08:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
mirror and and see what they are doing
 
08:24:11.430 --> 08:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
that creates that situation
 
08:24:14.150 --> 08:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll just give you a simple example
 
08:24:16.948 --> 08:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
my my house is on a three acre parcel of
 
08:24:16.958 --> 08:24:17.910 align:start position:0%
my my house is on a three acre parcel of
land

08:24:17.910 --> 08:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
land
 
08:24:21.110 --> 08:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
um on a state road and and i have a lot
 
08:24:23.110 --> 08:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
of frontage i got like 800 feet of
 
08:24:25.910 --> 08:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
frontage and my house is on one side and
 
08:24:27.350 --> 08:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
i could easily
 
08:24:30.468 --> 08:24:30.478 align:start position:0%
if i thought it was economical and
 
08:24:33.510 --> 08:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
put up a small house or manufactured
 
08:24:35.350 --> 08:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
house or whatever on the other side of
 
08:24:38.070 --> 08:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
my property and rent it out and if if
 
08:24:39.750 --> 08:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
that were
 
08:24:42.868 --> 08:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
a way to make money i might do it right
 
08:24:45.590 --> 08:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
but the rules prevent me from doing it
 
08:24:48.628 --> 08:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
why because my town has two acre zoning
 
08:24:50.388 --> 08:24:50.398 align:start position:0%
so i can't
 
08:24:50.398 --> 08:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
so i can't
uh

08:24:51.190 --> 08:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:24:53.110 --> 08:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to you divide the the
 
08:24:55.190 --> 08:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
property it's three acres even though i
 
08:24:56.788 --> 08:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
have plenty of septic i have plenty of
 
08:24:59.110 --> 08:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
water all that sort of thing
 
08:25:01.270 --> 08:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
my and and the rules prevent me from
 
08:25:03.670 --> 08:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
having more than one residence on this
 
08:25:06.070 --> 08:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
piece of property right so it's the
 
08:25:10.070 --> 08:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
rules that prevent affordable housing
 
08:25:11.430 --> 08:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
08:25:11.440 --> 08:25:12.708 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

08:25:12.708 --> 08:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:25:14.548 --> 08:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
08:25:17.190 --> 08:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
if you can if you control um
 
08:25:19.350 --> 08:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
you you let people use their their
 
08:25:21.750 --> 08:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
housing the way they want to
 
08:25:23.750 --> 08:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the market is going to push them to
 
08:25:25.670 --> 08:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
do things that are affordable you can
 
08:25:28.070 --> 08:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
that are that are economical right and
 
08:25:30.868 --> 08:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
so if there's a giant demand for for
 
08:25:33.590 --> 08:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
less expensive housing people will do it
 
08:25:35.510 --> 08:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they're able to do it and the problem
 
08:25:37.270 --> 08:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
is they're not
 
08:25:39.750 --> 08:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you any
 
08:25:43.350 --> 08:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions for mr mcguire
 
08:25:45.110 --> 08:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none our next
 
08:25:55.430 --> 08:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:57.670 --> 08:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
hello thank you good to see you again i
 
08:25:59.350 --> 08:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
think i called it at seven o'clock
 
08:26:02.628 --> 08:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
earlier when i testified we're close
 
08:26:02.638 --> 08:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
earlier when i testified we're close
um

08:26:03.990 --> 08:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:26:06.548 --> 08:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah holland i am the vice
 
08:26:08.628 --> 08:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
chair of the public policy committee on
 
08:26:10.468 --> 08:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire realtors
 
08:26:12.150 --> 08:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
you've already heard the specifics of
 
08:26:14.308 --> 08:26:14.318 align:start position:0%
the legislation and the realtors would
 
08:26:17.030 --> 08:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
echo those sentiments
 
08:26:18.548 --> 08:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
i would add that the lack of housing
 
08:26:20.308 --> 08:26:20.318 align:start position:0%
availability in new hampshire is not
 
08:26:22.468 --> 08:26:22.478 align:start position:0%
simply a local issue it's a state
 
08:26:22.478 --> 08:26:23.910 align:start position:0%
simply a local issue it's a state
problem

08:26:23.910 --> 08:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
08:26:27.270 --> 08:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the medium median sale price for
 
08:26:31.190 --> 08:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
single-family home was 395 000
 
08:26:33.590 --> 08:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that in 2019
 
08:26:35.510 --> 08:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
the median sale price was just three
 
08:26:38.070 --> 08:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars so that was a
 
08:26:40.308 --> 08:26:40.318 align:start position:0%
thirty percent increase in just two
 
08:26:42.868 --> 08:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
years and today it's
 
08:26:45.110 --> 08:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
over four hundred
 
08:26:46.628 --> 08:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps more importantly the total
 
08:26:48.150 --> 08:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
inventory of homes for sale in new
 
08:26:49.750 --> 08:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is currently at an all-time
 
08:26:49.760 --> 08:26:50.468 align:start position:0%
hampshire is currently at an all-time
low

08:26:50.468 --> 08:26:50.478 align:start position:0%
low
 
08:26:53.990 --> 08:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
in february of 2016 there were 7 500
 
08:26:56.628 --> 08:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
homes for sale across the state and in
 
08:27:00.308 --> 08:27:00.318 align:start position:0%
february of 2022 there were just 928
 
08:27:02.708 --> 08:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
that's an 87 percent reduction in the
 
08:27:05.990 --> 08:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
available inventory in just six years
 
08:27:07.830 --> 08:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
the inventory crisis is real and it's
 
08:27:10.230 --> 08:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
not getting any better and i want to add
 
08:27:12.308 --> 08:27:12.318 align:start position:0%
that it started well before covid but
 
08:27:16.230 --> 08:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
kovid certainly did accelerate it
 
08:27:18.788 --> 08:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
senate bill 400 is a needed step forward
 
08:27:21.270 --> 08:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
in ensuring an adequate supply of
 
08:27:23.110 --> 08:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
housing that is available for new
 
08:27:25.030 --> 08:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire's workforce
 
08:27:27.270 --> 08:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature has worked hard to make
 
08:27:30.708 --> 08:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire attractive to businesses
 
08:27:32.788 --> 08:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
and to all people
 
08:27:34.948 --> 08:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
our favorable tax climate and beautiful
 
08:27:37.110 --> 08:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
scenery are great incentives but they
 
08:27:39.350 --> 08:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
are all for nothing if a business person
 
08:27:41.910 --> 08:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
cannot find a place for their workers to
 
08:27:41.920 --> 08:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
cannot find a place for their workers to
live

08:27:43.750 --> 08:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
live
 
08:27:47.190 --> 08:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
so a healthy housing outlook would be in
 
08:27:49.510 --> 08:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
a specific community a variety of
 
08:27:52.230 --> 08:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
housing types and price points so people
 
08:27:54.150 --> 08:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
can kind of move around as their life
 
08:27:55.990 --> 08:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
kind of changes whether they have kids
 
08:27:57.670 --> 08:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're just starting out maybe they're
 
08:28:00.788 --> 08:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
retiring and downsizing and if they can
 
08:28:02.708 --> 08:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
do that all within one community they
 
08:28:08.388 --> 08:28:08.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:10.628 --> 08:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire takes pride in
 
08:28:12.628 --> 08:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
their local community and its ability to
 
08:28:15.350 --> 08:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
conduct its affairs in what it is what
 
08:28:17.350 --> 08:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
is in that specifics town's best
 
08:28:20.070 --> 08:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
interest however if one town places
 
08:28:22.788 --> 08:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning restrictions in an
 
08:28:24.628 --> 08:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
attempt to stop housing development
 
08:28:26.788 --> 08:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
their action is going to be impact and
 
08:28:29.670 --> 08:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
impact on all surrounding towns
 
08:28:31.590 --> 08:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
so what happens when one town's local
 
08:28:34.468 --> 08:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
control starts to negatively impede on
 
08:28:37.830 --> 08:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
another town's local control
 
08:28:39.350 --> 08:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
at that point we think it's appropriate
 
08:28:41.030 --> 08:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
for the state to step in and try to
 
08:28:43.990 --> 08:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize housing opportunities which
 
08:28:46.948 --> 08:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
sb 400 does
 
08:28:49.270 --> 08:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
so in march new hampshire association
 
08:28:51.750 --> 08:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
realtors conducted a statewide poll and
 
08:28:53.510 --> 08:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
we asked people if housing availability
 
08:28:55.590 --> 08:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
was a problem in their community
 
08:28:57.590 --> 08:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
78 that it was said that it was a
 
08:28:57.600 --> 08:28:58.628 align:start position:0%
78 that it was said that it was a
problem

08:28:58.628 --> 08:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
problem
 
08:29:01.270 --> 08:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
60 percent described it as a very big
 
08:29:01.280 --> 08:29:02.788 align:start position:0%
60 percent described it as a very big
problem

08:29:02.788 --> 08:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
problem
 
08:29:04.628 --> 08:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
when we asked if they believed housing
 
08:29:06.948 --> 08:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
costs and availability are a problem
 
08:29:09.830 --> 08:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic so these issues
 
08:29:11.990 --> 08:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
will resolve themselves as things return
 
08:29:14.070 --> 08:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
to normal or did they believe that
 
08:29:15.990 --> 08:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
housing costs and availability have been
 
08:29:18.150 --> 08:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
a problem for a long time and won't get
 
08:29:20.308 --> 08:29:20.318 align:start position:0%
better until elected officials take
 
08:29:20.318 --> 08:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
better until elected officials take
action

08:29:21.350 --> 08:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
action
 
08:29:23.830 --> 08:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
61 percent said elected officials need
 
08:29:26.548 --> 08:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
to take action while 32 percent said the
 
08:29:29.110 --> 08:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
market would take care of itself
 
08:29:31.670 --> 08:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
so sb 400 represents an opportunity for
 
08:29:33.830 --> 08:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the state to begin to turn the tide on
 
08:29:36.388 --> 08:29:36.398 align:start position:0%
housing availability in new hampshire
 
08:29:39.190 --> 08:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
and we certainly support that
 
08:29:40.948 --> 08:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
a couple of examples that just occurred
 
08:29:44.230 --> 08:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
this week in my line of work um
 
08:29:47.030 --> 08:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
one young woman whose house that she was
 
08:29:49.670 --> 08:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
renting is now for sale the owners are
 
08:29:52.468 --> 08:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
moving on for a variety of reasons and
 
08:29:54.708 --> 08:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
she no longer can live there so we're on
 
08:29:56.948 --> 08:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
the hunt to find an affordable property
 
08:29:59.270 --> 08:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
for her to either purchase or for her to
 
08:30:01.910 --> 08:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
rent we started the search within 45
 
08:30:03.750 --> 08:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
minutes of where she worked
 
08:30:05.510 --> 08:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
could not find anything
 
08:30:07.750 --> 08:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then so we started searching over an
 
08:30:10.708 --> 08:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
hour which brought us into vermont
 
08:30:13.990 --> 08:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and yes i'm licensed there as well
 
08:30:17.030 --> 08:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we only found two options and each
 
08:30:18.868 --> 08:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
of those two options there were droves
 
08:30:21.190 --> 08:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
and droves of people in her similar
 
08:30:21.200 --> 08:30:22.548 align:start position:0%
and droves of people in her similar
situation

08:30:22.548 --> 08:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
situation
 
08:30:24.150 --> 08:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
not folks from out of state who were
 
08:30:27.910 --> 08:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
looking for a vacation rental or a
 
08:30:29.510 --> 08:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
or a second home
 
08:30:32.548 --> 08:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
and the competition was fierce so it is
 
08:30:34.948 --> 08:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
not just one or two people that are
 
08:30:36.628 --> 08:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
looking for homes
 
08:30:38.308 --> 08:30:38.318 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of our workers that are
 
08:30:40.708 --> 08:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
willing to sacrifice their precious
 
08:30:43.510 --> 08:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
hours on the road to find an affordable
 
08:30:45.510 --> 08:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
house so we need to do something here in
 
08:30:48.788 --> 08:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to keep them local
 
08:30:51.430 --> 08:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
08:30:52.948 --> 08:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
08:30:55.910 --> 08:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
very much oh i'm sorry richard tripp
 
08:30:58.468 --> 08:30:58.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
08:31:00.788 --> 08:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that uh
 
08:31:02.708 --> 08:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
you said that
 
08:31:04.788 --> 08:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of homes that are either
 
08:31:08.308 --> 08:31:08.318 align:start position:0%
vacation rentals or second homes uh
 
08:31:09.750 --> 08:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
could you put
 
08:31:09.760 --> 08:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
could you put
a

08:31:11.110 --> 08:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
08:31:14.070 --> 08:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
number or a percentage on that
 
08:31:16.628 --> 08:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
so i think what i referred to is that
 
08:31:18.708 --> 08:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
the number of people that we were seeing
 
08:31:21.350 --> 08:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
at these the houses that were available
 
08:31:23.110 --> 08:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the price point for this particular
 
08:31:23.120 --> 08:31:24.150 align:start position:0%
in the price point for this particular
person

08:31:24.150 --> 08:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
08:31:24.160 --> 08:31:25.110 align:start position:0%
person
were

08:31:25.110 --> 08:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
08:31:27.350 --> 08:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
not looking for second homes they were
 
08:31:29.430 --> 08:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
very similar they were
 
08:31:31.830 --> 08:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
the same demographic of the person that
 
08:31:35.750 --> 08:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was representing so a person who has
 
08:31:38.230 --> 08:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
a an afford is looking for an affordable
 
08:31:39.670 --> 08:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
home based on the workforce housing
 
08:31:39.680 --> 08:31:41.270 align:start position:0%
home based on the workforce housing
definition

08:31:41.270 --> 08:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
definition
 
08:31:43.270 --> 08:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
and is looking for a place to live
 
08:31:45.110 --> 08:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
primarily in new hampshire
 
08:31:47.510 --> 08:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the folks that are lining up the out
 
08:31:50.308 --> 08:31:50.318 align:start position:0%
the door at new listings are not
 
08:31:52.468 --> 08:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily or overwhelmingly second
 
08:31:55.750 --> 08:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
home buyers or investors
 
08:31:55.760 --> 08:31:56.830 align:start position:0%
home buyers or investors

08:32:00.788 --> 08:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:02.948 --> 08:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
well i'm still interested in you know
 
08:32:02.958 --> 08:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
well i'm still interested in you know
the

08:32:03.830 --> 08:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:32:06.070 --> 08:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
the percentage of housing in new
 
08:32:06.080 --> 08:32:07.190 align:start position:0%
the percentage of housing in new
hampshire

08:32:07.190 --> 08:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:32:07.200 --> 08:32:08.788 align:start position:0%
hampshire
that

08:32:08.788 --> 08:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:32:11.750 --> 08:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:14.230 --> 08:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
vacation rental or second homes you know
 
08:32:16.230 --> 08:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
because it seems like
 
08:32:16.240 --> 08:32:17.110 align:start position:0%
because it seems like
uh

08:32:17.110 --> 08:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:32:20.308 --> 08:32:20.318 align:start position:0%
there is a large quantity of that
 
08:32:21.830 --> 08:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
08:32:23.910 --> 08:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of housing available
 
08:32:23.920 --> 08:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of housing available
to

08:32:24.830 --> 08:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:32:28.948 --> 08:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
others so i am not um i don't have
 
08:32:31.590 --> 08:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
numbers available for you
 
08:32:33.750 --> 08:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's something that then i don't
 
08:32:36.308 --> 08:32:36.318 align:start position:0%
know if ben has numbers on that and he
 
08:32:38.708 --> 08:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
can speak to that later
 
08:32:40.388 --> 08:32:40.398 align:start position:0%
but what i am seeing
 
08:32:43.110 --> 08:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
is the housing that we are looking for
 
08:32:45.350 --> 08:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the state that my clientele are
 
08:32:47.270 --> 08:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
looking for in order to stay in the
 
08:32:49.590 --> 08:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
communities or near the communities in
 
08:32:52.788 --> 08:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:54.548 --> 08:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
those properties are not necessarily
 
08:32:56.548 --> 08:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
going to second homeowners they are not
 
08:32:58.468 --> 08:32:58.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to people who are
 
08:33:00.308 --> 08:33:00.318 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
08:33:02.070 --> 08:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
to rent it out short term as an
 
08:33:02.080 --> 08:33:04.548 align:start position:0%
to rent it out short term as an
investment

not read to you
um

08:33:58.230 --> 08:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:34:00.468 --> 08:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
08:34:02.788 --> 08:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
severe housing crisis
 
08:34:07.030 --> 08:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:09.990 --> 08:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
newly graduated medical residents are
 
08:34:12.468 --> 08:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
declining jobs at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
08:34:13.990 --> 08:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
despite their reputation because they
 
08:34:16.708 --> 08:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
can't find a place to live
 
08:34:19.510 --> 08:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
engineers are declining jobs at nobis
 
08:34:21.110 --> 08:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
because they can't find an affordable
 
08:34:22.868 --> 08:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
place to live
 
08:34:25.030 --> 08:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
we have an increase in family
 
08:34:25.040 --> 08:34:28.150 align:start position:0%
we have an increase in family
homelessness

08:34:28.150 --> 08:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:30.548 --> 08:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
this is really severe and so as a matter
 
08:34:32.868 --> 08:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
of policy development as a matter of
 
08:34:36.230 --> 08:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
action we're asking the legislator what
 
08:34:36.240 --> 08:34:37.110 align:start position:0%
action we're asking the legislator what
can

08:34:37.110 --> 08:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
can
 
08:34:39.110 --> 08:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
we do
 
08:34:42.150 --> 08:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
since 2019 the governor recognizing that
 
08:34:45.270 --> 08:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:47.990 --> 08:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
an economic issue for the state
 
08:34:49.750 --> 08:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
put the best and the brightest in the
 
08:34:51.830 --> 08:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
room for 90 days and said come up with
 
08:34:54.388 --> 08:34:54.398 align:start position:0%
solutions and respect local control
 
08:34:55.910 --> 08:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they came up with
 
08:35:00.070 --> 08:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
two bills house bill 1632 in 1629 this
 
08:35:02.788 --> 08:35:02.798 align:start position:0%
committee supported both of those bills
 
08:35:06.468 --> 08:35:06.478 align:start position:0%
we had covered truncated session
 
08:35:09.830 --> 08:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
end up next year 586 we combined both of
 
08:35:11.830 --> 08:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
those bills this committee again
 
08:35:14.788 --> 08:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
supported those proposals so we're back
 
08:35:14.798 --> 08:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
supported those proposals so we're back
again

08:35:15.830 --> 08:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
08:35:19.350 --> 08:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
this time the bill is called sb 400 it's
 
08:35:21.750 --> 08:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
got a little more compromise
 
08:35:24.468 --> 08:35:24.478 align:start position:0%
it's got it addresses all the issues
 
08:35:27.030 --> 08:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we've named over the years
 
08:35:28.708 --> 08:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
it is
 
08:35:30.948 --> 08:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
not a mandate it is not the state saying
 
08:35:32.788 --> 08:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
to a municipality you have to do this
 
08:35:34.948 --> 08:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
because we have a crisis we're saying
 
08:35:37.110 --> 08:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
we will give you tools
 
08:35:40.308 --> 08:35:40.318 align:start position:0%
that already exist for other things
 
08:35:41.510 --> 08:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
and say
 
08:35:43.510 --> 08:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
if you are ready to say yes in my
 
08:35:46.628 --> 08:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
backyard community
 
08:35:49.350 --> 08:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
then we are empowering you to do so
 
08:35:51.910 --> 08:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
if litchfield does not want to change
 
08:35:54.388 --> 08:35:54.398 align:start position:0%
the bucolic nature and does not want to
 
08:35:56.708 --> 08:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
take any action with sb 400 it doesn't
 
08:36:00.150 --> 08:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
have to but if dover wants to if dover
 
08:36:04.150 --> 08:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
wants to use 79e or wants to use tiff
 
08:36:06.548 --> 08:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature is saying we recognize
 
08:36:09.910 --> 08:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
we have a problem here are more tools
 
08:36:12.230 --> 08:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does
 
08:36:14.308 --> 08:36:14.318 align:start position:0%
the um
 
08:36:15.670 --> 08:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
the it's
 
08:36:17.670 --> 08:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's a carrot approach it's not going to
 
08:36:19.350 --> 08:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
put folks on a list and say these
 
08:36:20.548 --> 08:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
communities are bad and these
 
08:36:22.788 --> 08:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
communities are good it's saying if you
 
08:36:25.670 --> 08:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
are doing well yes in my backyard and we
 
08:36:27.830 --> 08:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
can use you as an example we're going to
 
08:36:29.830 --> 08:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
give you an award and call you a
 
08:36:29.840 --> 08:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
give you an award and call you a
champion

08:36:31.030 --> 08:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
champion
 
08:36:31.040 --> 08:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
champion
um

08:36:31.910 --> 08:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:36:33.910 --> 08:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's like tree city usa or bicycle
 
08:36:35.590 --> 08:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
friend communities or any of these other
 
08:36:38.388 --> 08:36:38.398 align:start position:0%
municipal incentive programs that say
 
08:36:38.398 --> 08:36:39.270 align:start position:0%
municipal incentive programs that say
you're

08:36:39.270 --> 08:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're
 
08:36:40.788 --> 08:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
you're doing a good job on this if you
 
08:36:42.948 --> 08:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it you do not have to
 
08:36:45.670 --> 08:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
so essentially i just there's
 
08:36:47.030 --> 08:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think this
 
08:36:49.110 --> 08:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
these proposals can be watered down
 
08:36:49.120 --> 08:36:50.230 align:start position:0%
these proposals can be watered down
anymore

08:36:50.230 --> 08:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
08:36:54.070 --> 08:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think we have a serious crisis and
 
08:36:56.150 --> 08:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
so many organizations and business
 
08:36:58.548 --> 08:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
interests are asking the legislature to
 
08:36:58.558 --> 08:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
interests are asking the legislature to
act

08:36:59.590 --> 08:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
act
 
08:37:02.388 --> 08:37:02.398 align:start position:0%
and give tools for those ready to meet
 
08:37:03.830 --> 08:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
market demand
 
08:37:05.590 --> 08:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can ensure that we have a
 
08:37:07.750 --> 08:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
workforce for the future
 
08:37:09.510 --> 08:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions any
 
08:37:12.388 --> 08:37:12.398 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
08:37:13.750 --> 08:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
08:37:16.708 --> 08:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if these
 
08:37:19.030 --> 08:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
provisions are already in statute what
 
08:37:21.990 --> 08:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
is the reason why that you know
 
08:37:23.830 --> 08:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
this type of housing is not being
 
08:37:26.468 --> 08:37:26.478 align:start position:0%
developed in new hampshire and
 
08:37:28.230 --> 08:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
08:37:31.030 --> 08:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 400 is going to fix that
 
08:37:34.150 --> 08:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
well for example 79es already exists but
 
08:37:36.628 --> 08:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
they might use it to restore a local
 
08:37:40.788 --> 08:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
theater or preserve a historic farm and
 
08:37:42.388 --> 08:37:42.398 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is
 
08:37:43.910 --> 08:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to use it for housing
 
08:37:43.920 --> 08:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
if you want to use it for housing
municipality

08:37:45.830 --> 08:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
08:37:48.308 --> 08:37:48.318 align:start position:0%
you can do that it's up to you so that's
 
08:37:49.830 --> 08:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
what i mean these are tools that exist
 
08:37:51.750 --> 08:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
for their economic development tools
 
08:37:54.468 --> 08:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
that the state has already put into play
 
08:37:57.270 --> 08:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
and so a group of thoughtful people
 
08:37:59.270 --> 08:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
who really know what's out there in
 
08:38:01.270 --> 08:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
terms of policy and economic development
 
08:38:02.468 --> 08:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
tools that are already
 
08:38:04.468 --> 08:38:04.478 align:start position:0%
available to municipalities said let's
 
08:38:06.308 --> 08:38:06.318 align:start position:0%
put housing in the mix and that's all
 
08:38:09.350 --> 08:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:10.548 --> 08:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
08:38:13.030 --> 08:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it and and i
 
08:38:14.948 --> 08:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate your patience and us with our
 
08:38:16.548 --> 08:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
schedule that we're
 
08:38:17.830 --> 08:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
up against
 
08:38:30.388 --> 08:38:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:31.830 --> 08:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
08:38:33.670 --> 08:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee i'll be real brief because
 
08:38:35.590 --> 08:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
like all of you i want to hear more from
 
08:38:37.510 --> 08:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
ben frost so
 
08:38:39.590 --> 08:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
once again i'm dave giuve i'm a senior
 
08:38:41.190 --> 08:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
vice president for the business and
 
08:38:42.868 --> 08:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
industry association i want to make just
 
08:38:44.070 --> 08:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
two points and i'll make them very
 
08:38:47.430 --> 08:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
quickly the first is again to emphasize
 
08:38:49.350 --> 08:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
the lack of workforce housing which
 
08:38:51.350 --> 08:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've all come to understand is a
 
08:38:54.070 --> 08:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
significant issue for an employer and
 
08:38:56.548 --> 08:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
it's making their job of hiring and
 
08:38:59.270 --> 08:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
retaining workers much more difficult so
 
08:39:01.670 --> 08:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is something that employers around
 
08:39:03.590 --> 08:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
the state care about
 
08:39:05.670 --> 08:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
the second thing i'd like to do is
 
08:39:08.468 --> 08:39:08.478 align:start position:0%
refute what a previous testifier said
 
08:39:11.430 --> 08:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
that i found was astonishing
 
08:39:13.110 --> 08:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
when he said he was opposing the bill
 
08:39:15.830 --> 08:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
because it takes away local control
 
08:39:17.670 --> 08:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
i assure you there was a lot of work
 
08:39:20.150 --> 08:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
done in drafting this bill to make sure
 
08:39:22.230 --> 08:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
that it did not take away
 
08:39:25.030 --> 08:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
local control and that the
 
08:39:27.190 --> 08:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
tools that were given were something
 
08:39:30.230 --> 08:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that a community could choose to use or
 
08:39:31.990 --> 08:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
choose not to use
 
08:39:34.468 --> 08:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
the the idea that this somehow takes
 
08:39:36.628 --> 08:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
away local control i find astonishing
 
08:39:38.548 --> 08:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to believe me
 
08:39:40.548 --> 08:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
look at the new hampshire municipal
 
08:39:42.628 --> 08:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
association who said they were neutral
 
08:39:44.708 --> 08:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
on the bill i assure you and i think you
 
08:39:46.948 --> 08:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
all know this if there were issues in
 
08:39:49.110 --> 08:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
this bill taking away local control the
 
08:39:51.190 --> 08:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
municipal association would have been
 
08:39:53.990 --> 08:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
the first to say so mr chairman that
 
08:39:55.910 --> 08:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony i'd be happy to
 
08:39:58.230 --> 08:39:58.240 align:start position:0%

next uh
 
08:40:10.150 --> 08:40:10.160 align:start position:0%

i've
 
08:40:33.270 --> 08:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
been deeply involved in the weeds of the
 
08:40:35.590 --> 08:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
details of local planning and zoning for
 
08:40:37.670 --> 08:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
the last five years
 
08:40:39.590 --> 08:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
08:40:41.590 --> 08:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
to give my testimony to refute the
 
08:40:44.708 --> 08:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
notion that everything in this bill is
 
08:40:47.030 --> 08:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary and that it doesn't damage
 
08:40:54.070 --> 08:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:54.080 --> 08:40:54.868 align:start position:0%
 
if

08:40:54.868 --> 08:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
08:40:58.070 --> 08:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
sb 400 is passed it will significantly
 
08:40:59.590 --> 08:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
limit the authority
 
08:41:01.750 --> 08:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
of local land use boards relating to
 
08:41:03.510 --> 08:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
development projects
 
08:41:06.230 --> 08:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
sb 400 is a bill which is incompletely
 
08:41:09.750 --> 08:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
titled relative to training
 
08:41:11.590 --> 08:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
in procedures for zoning and planning
 
08:41:13.670 --> 08:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
boards relative to financial investments
 
08:41:15.510 --> 08:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and incentives the bill actually
 
08:41:18.628 --> 08:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
contains several provisions which reduce
 
08:41:20.948 --> 08:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
the authority of local land use boards
 
08:41:24.150 --> 08:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
as well as boards of selectmen
 
08:41:26.628 --> 08:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
the bill narrowly passed the senate
 
08:41:29.190 --> 08:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
on 317 and i'll describe seven
 
08:41:32.708 --> 08:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
problematic aspects for you now
 
08:41:35.190 --> 08:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
sp 400 states
 
08:41:37.830 --> 08:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
that if towns offer incentives
 
08:41:40.070 --> 08:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
for senior housing such as increased
 
08:41:42.708 --> 08:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
density reduced lot size expedited

approval

08:41:44.070 --> 08:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
approval
 
08:41:46.308 --> 08:41:46.318 align:start position:0%
or other dimensional or procedural
 
08:41:50.150 --> 08:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
incentives it shall shall offer those
 
08:41:52.468 --> 08:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
incentives to workforce housing and i
 
08:41:55.270 --> 08:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to page one
 
08:41:56.548 --> 08:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
08:42:01.510 --> 08:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:01.520 --> 08:42:02.708 align:start position:0%

25
 
08:42:05.110 --> 08:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'll just read that one sentence it says
 
08:42:08.788 --> 08:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
beginning in july 1st 2023
 
08:42:10.788 --> 08:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
incentives established for housing for
 
08:42:13.510 --> 08:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
older persons shall be deemed applicable
 
08:42:15.590 --> 08:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
to workforce housing what that actually
 
08:42:18.388 --> 08:42:18.398 align:start position:0%
means is the voters of a town who may
 
08:42:20.388 --> 08:42:20.398 align:start position:0%
have decided that they wanted to provide
 
08:42:22.070 --> 08:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of incentive for workforce
 
08:42:23.910 --> 08:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
housing for people to downsize in their
 
08:42:23.920 --> 08:42:26.230 align:start position:0%
housing for people to downsize in their
community

08:42:26.230 --> 08:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
08:42:27.830 --> 08:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
their local zoning ordinance is going to
 
08:42:30.788 --> 08:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
be overwritten if you pass this and any
 
08:42:31.670 --> 08:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
of those
 
08:42:31.680 --> 08:42:32.948 align:start position:0%
of those
those

08:42:32.948 --> 08:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
those
 
08:42:35.830 --> 08:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
benefits that were applied to housing
 
08:42:37.270 --> 08:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
for older persons those retirement
 
08:42:40.628 --> 08:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
communities they would automatically be
 
08:42:43.590 --> 08:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
applied to workforce housing
 
08:42:45.910 --> 08:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
many towns have prioritized senior
 
08:42:45.920 --> 08:42:47.350 align:start position:0%
many towns have prioritized senior
housing

08:42:47.350 --> 08:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
housing
 
08:42:48.628 --> 08:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
and their voters have approved these
 
08:42:51.030 --> 08:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
developments on smaller lot sizes
 
08:42:53.110 --> 08:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
forcing towns to apply these densities
 
08:42:55.590 --> 08:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
to workforce housing will result in
 
08:42:57.990 --> 08:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
increased water usage and require
 
08:43:00.308 --> 08:43:00.318 align:start position:0%
additional town services
 
08:43:02.150 --> 08:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
these senior housing incentives were
 
08:43:03.830 --> 08:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the voters
 
08:43:05.430 --> 08:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the assumption that one to two
 
08:43:08.628 --> 08:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
residents would occupy a smaller lot
 
08:43:10.628 --> 08:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
workforce housing will not be limited to
 
08:43:12.628 --> 08:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
one to two residents
 
08:43:15.430 --> 08:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
and demand for groundwater is greater
 
08:43:17.670 --> 08:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
in summer of 2020 the state experienced
 
08:43:19.350 --> 08:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
the significant drought
 
08:43:20.868 --> 08:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
and some wells in the southern towns
 
08:43:21.990 --> 08:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
went dry
 
08:43:23.670 --> 08:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
if family housing
 
08:43:25.750 --> 08:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
development requirements are forcibly
 
08:43:28.230 --> 08:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
linked to senior housing development
 
08:43:30.708 --> 08:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
requirements this will create a burden
 
08:43:32.150 --> 08:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
on water demand
 
08:43:35.030 --> 08:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
as well as educational services
 
08:43:37.910 --> 08:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
local residents are in the best position
 
08:43:39.510 --> 08:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
to determine the specifics of their
 
08:43:41.910 --> 08:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
community this bill overrides the
 
08:43:43.990 --> 08:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
decision of those voters
 
08:43:46.628 --> 08:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
and unreasonably links two separate and
 
08:43:49.190 --> 08:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
distinct types of housing
 
08:43:50.948 --> 08:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's important that local land-use
 
08:43:53.670 --> 08:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
decisions are made by town residents who
 
08:43:55.510 --> 08:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest
 
08:43:57.190 --> 08:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the outcomes
 
08:43:59.590 --> 08:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
so that certainly is not a voluntary
 
08:44:01.510 --> 08:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
provision of this bill
 
08:44:03.750 --> 08:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
the next item s p
 
08:44:07.030 --> 08:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
400 states that if land use boards
 
08:44:08.868 --> 08:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
fail to provide specific written
 
08:44:10.468 --> 08:44:10.478 align:start position:0%
findings of facts
 
08:44:12.230 --> 08:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
which are supportive of their decisions
 
08:44:14.708 --> 08:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
with regard to developers applications
 
08:44:16.230 --> 08:44:16.240 align:start position:0%

it shall be grounds for automatic

08:44:22.230 --> 08:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the board's decision
 
08:44:24.308 --> 08:44:24.318 align:start position:0%
this language is vague
 
08:44:25.750 --> 08:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
how would the housing appeals board
 
08:44:28.548 --> 08:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
determine what is or is not
 
08:44:28.558 --> 08:44:29.140 align:start position:0%

automatic reversal
 
08:44:34.708 --> 08:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
is not an appropriate action
 
08:44:36.868 --> 08:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
for a technical problem with a

disapproval
 
08:44:40.708 --> 08:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
this clause has the potential to force
 
08:44:44.628 --> 08:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
approvals of non-compliant projects on
 
08:44:49.030 --> 08:44:49.040 align:start position:0%

08:44:59.670 --> 08:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
08:45:02.948 --> 08:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
it imposes a new
 
08:45:05.110 --> 08:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
90-day time constraint on local zoning
 
08:45:08.308 --> 08:45:08.318 align:start position:0%
boards and it imposes a 65-day limit on
 
08:45:10.708 --> 08:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
planning boards eliminating the present
 
08:45:13.670 --> 08:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
methods for extension
 
08:45:15.750 --> 08:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
as you know projects before land use
 
08:45:17.830 --> 08:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
boards vary in size
 
08:45:20.230 --> 08:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
and scope greatly
 
08:45:21.910 --> 08:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
how could the same deadline be
 
08:45:23.590 --> 08:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the construction of a
 
08:45:24.948 --> 08:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
single house
 
08:45:27.270 --> 08:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
and also for the construction of a 200
 
08:45:29.190 --> 08:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
unit complex
 
08:45:31.510 --> 08:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
large projects involving many housing
 
08:45:33.910 --> 08:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
units require additional technical
 
08:45:36.308 --> 08:45:36.318 align:start position:0%
review time the engineering work
 
08:45:39.510 --> 08:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
including storm water and roadway design
 
08:45:42.708 --> 08:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
demands commensurate attention
 
08:45:44.388 --> 08:45:44.398 align:start position:0%
how could a strict deadline serve to
 
08:45:46.628 --> 08:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
allow local boards to make careful and
 
08:45:48.388 --> 08:45:48.398 align:start position:0%
informed decisions
 
08:45:51.670 --> 08:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
why override their ability to
 
08:45:56.830 --> 08:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:01.110 --> 08:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
deadlines next we have sp 400 initially
 
08:46:04.230 --> 08:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
initiates an unelected board greatly
 
08:46:07.430 --> 08:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
insulated from the voters of the state
 
08:46:09.590 --> 08:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
the 16-member board includes

08:46:11.110 --> 08:46:11.120 align:start position:0%

this provision

moving on
 
08:47:29.510 --> 08:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
s p 400 would allow the same developer

to resubmit a denied application
 
08:47:34.628 --> 08:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
present case law known as the fischer
 
08:47:37.190 --> 08:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
doctrine holds that the denial of a
 
08:47:40.070 --> 08:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
local project is final
 
08:47:43.510 --> 08:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
sp 400 would allow re-submittals if the
 
08:47:46.308 --> 08:47:46.318 align:start position:0%
case were dismissed without prejudice
 
08:47:47.750 --> 08:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
this process
 
08:47:47.760 --> 08:47:48.628 align:start position:0%
this process
would

08:47:48.628 --> 08:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
would
 
08:47:50.948 --> 08:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
put a financial burden on the local

08:47:57.750 --> 08:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
who would now have to oppose the same

project multiple times
 
08:48:03.110 --> 08:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
the finality of local land use board
 
08:48:05.270 --> 08:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
decisions is an important protection for
 
08:48:07.990 --> 08:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
abutters who cannot afford to fight
 
08:48:10.628 --> 08:48:10.638 align:start position:0%

08:48:19.830 --> 08:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
last point here sp 400 changes the
 
08:48:21.910 --> 08:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
procedures and the timelines currently
 
08:48:23.750 --> 08:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
used by planning boards city councils
 
08:48:25.750 --> 08:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
and select boards to consider a
 
08:48:27.750 --> 08:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
development application
 
08:48:29.030 --> 08:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
the current procedures are well
 
08:48:31.270 --> 08:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
established and understood protocols the
 
08:48:33.350 --> 08:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
amended language removes the ability of
 
08:48:35.350 --> 08:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
city councils and select board to
 
08:48:38.070 --> 08:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
identify non-compliances with ordinances
 
08:48:39.830 --> 08:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and regulations
 
08:48:42.070 --> 08:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
so this isn't about timing this is
 
08:48:43.990 --> 08:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
taking away the ability to identify the
 
08:48:44.000 --> 08:48:45.130 align:start position:0%
taking away the ability to identify the
non-compliances

08:48:45.130 --> 08:48:45.140 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
08:48:48.868 --> 08:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
this reduces local oversight
 
08:48:50.150 --> 08:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
and only serves the interest of
 
08:48:50.160 --> 08:48:51.990 align:start position:0%
and only serves the interest of
developers

08:48:51.990 --> 08:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
developers
 
08:48:53.910 --> 08:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the goal of the state statute should be
 
08:48:56.308 --> 08:48:56.318 align:start position:0%
to preserve due process
 
08:48:58.708 --> 08:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
for all residents and to be sure that
 
08:49:01.110 --> 08:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
any developments that are approved are
 
08:49:03.510 --> 08:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
compliant with the ordinances that the
 
08:49:05.750 --> 08:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
residents voted for
 
08:49:07.670 --> 08:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
it seems sp 400 is designed to
 
08:49:10.388 --> 08:49:10.398 align:start position:0%
facilitate development approvals without
 
08:49:13.670 --> 08:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
regard to compliance for local residents
 
08:49:16.788 --> 08:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
local regulations and ordinances
 
08:49:19.030 --> 08:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
so wrapping up
 
08:49:22.150 --> 08:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
considering all these uh reductions
 
08:49:24.628 --> 08:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
in local municipal authority created by
 
08:49:25.830 --> 08:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
the inclusion
 
08:49:25.840 --> 08:49:26.948 align:start position:0%
the inclusion
all

08:49:26.948 --> 08:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
all
 
08:49:28.548 --> 08:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
the ones that were created by the
 
08:49:30.948 --> 08:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the housing appeals board
 
08:49:33.910 --> 08:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
which was added as a negotiation
 
08:49:37.030 --> 08:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
into the budget in 2019 how can the
 
08:49:40.628 --> 08:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
passage of sb 400 be justified
 
08:49:42.308 --> 08:49:42.318 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that the serious
 
08:49:45.110 --> 08:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
limitations on local authority
 
08:49:48.388 --> 08:49:48.398 align:start position:0%
should result in an itl recommendation
 
08:49:50.070 --> 08:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
08:49:51.750 --> 08:49:51.760 align:start position:0%

so um
 
08:50:23.990 --> 08:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have stated that you're
 
08:50:26.070 --> 08:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with local planning

with regard to any feedback that you've
 
08:50:33.590 --> 08:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
received from your town and your
 
08:50:34.468 --> 08:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
you know
 
08:50:36.868 --> 08:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
elected officials what is their feedback
 
08:50:39.910 --> 08:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
with regards to this bill
 
08:50:42.868 --> 08:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
so i believe they are working on a
 
08:50:44.708 --> 08:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
drafting a letter
 
08:50:47.030 --> 08:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
to provide to this committee i i haven't
 
08:50:49.430 --> 08:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
seen the language of that letter yet
 
08:50:51.430 --> 08:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm expecting it'll be available to
 
08:50:51.440 --> 08:50:52.708 align:start position:0%
but i'm expecting it'll be available to
you

08:50:52.708 --> 08:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
08:50:54.770 --> 08:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
before you execute the bill on the 18th

to refrain from stating those right now
okay

my name is regina barnes i am a new

hampshire patriot and i am here
 
08:51:37.430 --> 08:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
representing statewide citizens who
 
08:51:38.948 --> 08:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
cannot make it today
 
08:51:41.350 --> 08:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
i have been following the housing what
 
08:51:42.788 --> 08:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
has been happening in concord here for
 
08:51:45.430 --> 08:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
quite some time for about the spri
 
08:51:48.150 --> 08:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much since 2019 when the housing
 
08:51:49.910 --> 08:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
appeals board um was snuck into the
 
08:51:52.308 --> 08:51:52.318 align:start position:0%
budget as part of the budget deal
 
08:51:55.670 --> 08:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
so i do i am completely opposed to this
 
08:51:58.468 --> 08:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
i believe the hampton buda selectmen has
 
08:52:01.270 --> 08:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to you in regards to
 
08:52:03.590 --> 08:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 249 i'm not sure if they
 
08:52:05.590 --> 08:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
acted on this bill or not and that was
 
08:52:09.270 --> 08:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
to oppose senate bill 249.
 
08:52:11.430 --> 08:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that is a prior
 
08:52:13.430 --> 08:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
selectment in hampton and also as a
 
08:52:15.350 --> 08:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much lifelong resident
 
08:52:17.830 --> 08:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
hampton is a prime example
 
08:52:21.590 --> 08:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
of development at a very very fast pace
 
08:52:23.510 --> 08:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
it has been summarized to us recently
 
08:52:26.308 --> 08:52:26.318 align:start position:0%
that approximately only nine percent
 
08:52:29.190 --> 08:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
of our town is conserved so 91 percent
 
08:52:30.388 --> 08:52:30.398 align:start position:0%
of it is developed
 
08:52:32.230 --> 08:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
so our planning board and our zoning
 
08:52:34.468 --> 08:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
board i believe do a very good job
 
08:52:36.150 --> 08:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
at working with property owners
 
08:52:37.750 --> 08:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
developers to make sure the projects
 
08:52:39.990 --> 08:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
that they want to pass get passed and i
 
08:52:41.270 --> 08:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we need any state
 
08:52:43.670 --> 08:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
interference we haven't so far
 
08:52:43.680 --> 08:52:44.548 align:start position:0%
interference we haven't so far
so

08:52:44.548 --> 08:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:52:47.590 --> 08:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
primarily objective to this sb 400 is
 
08:52:49.670 --> 08:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
this in my view now i know a lot of
 
08:52:51.830 --> 08:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
people said this is all you know it's
 
08:52:54.308 --> 08:52:54.318 align:start position:0%
all up to the community but when you
 
08:52:56.230 --> 08:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
offer the community
 
08:52:56.240 --> 08:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
offer the community
money

08:52:57.270 --> 08:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
08:52:58.628 --> 08:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be state money or
 
08:53:00.388 --> 08:53:00.398 align:start position:0%
federal funds i'm not sure but when you
 
08:53:01.670 --> 08:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
offer them monies that are going to be
 
08:53:04.388 --> 08:53:04.398 align:start position:0%
either grants or low interest rates for
 
08:53:06.150 --> 08:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
water and soar things have been needed
 
08:53:07.590 --> 08:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
in their communities to me that's a
 
08:53:10.230 --> 08:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
bribe that's a bribe to do what is
 
08:53:13.030 --> 08:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
wanted by the state of new hampshire and
 
08:53:15.190 --> 08:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
its government so
 
08:53:17.190 --> 08:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
in my view this grants more authority to
 
08:53:19.590 --> 08:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
unelected conquered bureaucrats
 
08:53:21.110 --> 08:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the already
 
08:53:23.270 --> 08:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional housing appeals board
 
08:53:25.510 --> 08:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
it will cause the demise of what is left
 
08:53:28.230 --> 08:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
of state and municipal sovereignty
 
08:53:30.388 --> 08:53:30.398 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of people behind me are in
 
08:53:32.548 --> 08:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and i know where
 
08:53:34.070 --> 08:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
they represented they stated who they
 
08:53:36.070 --> 08:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
represent but my question is who
 
08:53:37.590 --> 08:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
represents the regular people that have
 
08:53:39.670 --> 08:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
lived in this state for decades who's
 
08:53:41.510 --> 08:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
representing those people i'm going to
 
08:53:44.628 --> 08:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
try to represent some of them right now
 
08:53:47.270 --> 08:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
sb 400 grants authority to the office of
 
08:53:49.110 --> 08:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
planning and development to determine
 
08:53:51.910 --> 08:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
preferential access to state resources
 
08:53:53.750 --> 08:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
which is what that whole
 
08:53:53.760 --> 08:53:54.948 align:start position:0%
which is what that whole
community

08:53:54.948 --> 08:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
community
 
08:53:56.948 --> 08:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what it's called incentive
 
08:53:59.350 --> 08:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
plan is i know hampton's in one with
 
08:54:02.388 --> 08:54:02.398 align:start position:0%
regards to um flood insurance
 
08:54:04.868 --> 08:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
we have to do all these extra things go
 
08:54:07.830 --> 08:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
over all these bat all these hurdles and
 
08:54:09.430 --> 08:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know what we can't we're not even
 
08:54:11.430 --> 08:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
getting into the program
 
08:54:13.670 --> 08:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
because we have four or five properties
 
08:54:15.830 --> 08:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
that are not compliant
 
08:54:17.750 --> 08:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
so unless they actually go to those four
 
08:54:19.430 --> 08:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
or five properties and force the
 
08:54:22.388 --> 08:54:22.398 align:start position:0%
property owners to do upgrades
 
08:54:24.948 --> 08:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
then it's it's been a waste of time and
 
08:54:26.628 --> 08:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
we've been it now for at least six seven
 
08:54:28.150 --> 08:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
or eight years
 
08:54:30.468 --> 08:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
so um
 
08:54:32.548 --> 08:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
how is it fair for royal towns to choose
 
08:54:35.190 --> 08:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
not to urbanize in my view this is going
 
08:54:38.548 --> 08:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
to pit towns that want to stay small
 
08:54:38.558 --> 08:54:39.590 align:start position:0%
to pit towns that want to stay small
local

08:54:39.590 --> 08:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
local
 
08:54:41.110 --> 08:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be rural communities
 
08:54:43.110 --> 08:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
not everyone wants to live in an urban
 
08:54:44.868 --> 08:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
community that's why many of us moved to
 
08:54:46.468 --> 08:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
08:54:46.478 --> 08:54:47.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
so

08:54:47.590 --> 08:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:54:49.670 --> 08:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't all of the state have access
 
08:54:51.990 --> 08:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the state resources not just a select
 
08:54:52.000 --> 08:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
to the state resources not just a select
few

08:54:53.030 --> 08:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
few
 
08:54:54.628 --> 08:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
please vote against this bill to
 
08:54:56.468 --> 08:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
preserve the unity of the state's rural
 
08:54:58.150 --> 08:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
08:54:59.750 --> 08:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the question i really want to leave
 
08:55:01.110 --> 08:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
with you is
 
08:55:02.708 --> 08:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
who should control the housing
 
08:55:04.150 --> 08:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
developers should it be the
 
08:55:06.468 --> 08:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
municipalities or should it be state
 
08:55:08.548 --> 08:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
appointed boards
 
08:55:10.468 --> 08:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
and the senate failed by passing this
 
08:55:12.468 --> 08:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
bill onto the house and i hope that the
 
08:55:15.030 --> 08:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
house will kill it on on its arrival
 
08:55:15.040 --> 08:55:16.830 align:start position:0%
house will kill it on on its arrival
thank

08:55:16.830 --> 08:55:16.840 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman for the record and
 
08:56:11.110 --> 08:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
joe got three rockingham 13 hampstead
 
08:56:12.468 --> 08:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
and kingston
 
08:56:14.868 --> 08:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to speak uh
 
08:56:16.708 --> 08:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
against uh
 
08:56:19.510 --> 08:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
400 senate bill 400
 
08:56:21.110 --> 08:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the reason be
 
08:56:23.430 --> 08:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
as submitted
 
08:56:26.230 --> 08:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh maybe in fact my comments should have
 
08:56:28.150 --> 08:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
been saved and they probably rightfully
 
08:56:30.388 --> 08:56:30.398 align:start position:0%
belong personal privilege before the
 
08:56:32.628 --> 08:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
full house
 
08:56:34.788 --> 08:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
because my objection is
 
08:56:37.910 --> 08:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
at the way the bill is submitted and in
 
08:56:37.920 --> 08:56:38.868 align:start position:0%
at the way the bill is submitted and in
spite

08:56:38.868 --> 08:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
spite
 
08:56:41.270 --> 08:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
of all the due respect i have for the
 
08:56:41.280 --> 08:56:42.468 align:start position:0%
of all the due respect i have for the
governor

08:56:42.468 --> 08:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
governor
 
08:56:44.308 --> 08:56:44.318 align:start position:0%
and particularly the
 
08:56:47.350 --> 08:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
prime sports or this bill
 
08:56:50.150 --> 08:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
i i just i'm going to have a hard time
 
08:56:51.510 --> 08:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
supporting it
 
08:56:54.948 --> 08:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
and if you all recall last session
 
08:56:56.708 --> 08:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
we had what they used to call what they
 
08:56:59.030 --> 08:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
called omnibus bills it was because of
 
08:57:00.308 --> 08:57:00.318 align:start position:0%
the virus
 
08:57:02.468 --> 08:57:02.478 align:start position:0%
you know where they put you know 25
 
08:57:03.990 --> 08:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
bills or whatever it is
 
08:57:05.910 --> 08:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we all voted on them and it was
 
08:57:07.350 --> 08:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
either take a
 
08:57:07.360 --> 08:57:08.388 align:start position:0%
either take a
leave

08:57:08.388 --> 08:57:08.398 align:start position:0%
leave
 
08:57:08.398 --> 08:57:09.270 align:start position:0%
leave
and

08:57:09.270 --> 08:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:57:11.270 --> 08:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
some of them might have been germaine as
 
08:57:12.948 --> 08:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
these are germane
 
08:57:14.868 --> 08:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh but you know it was take it and leave
 
08:57:17.270 --> 08:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
it and that was the way it is
 
08:57:19.510 --> 08:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
i said to myself when the virus went
 
08:57:21.670 --> 08:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
that i couldn't vote for
 
08:57:24.070 --> 08:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill and i submit to you that
 
08:57:26.868 --> 08:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
this is an omnibus bill there's three
 
08:57:29.350 --> 08:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
separate items in here they're all
 
08:57:29.360 --> 08:57:31.590 align:start position:0%
separate items in here they're all
germane

08:57:31.590 --> 08:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
germane
 
08:57:33.990 --> 08:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you like the the uh
 
08:57:36.150 --> 08:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
the first two sections you know like
 
08:57:37.750 --> 08:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
like the certificate
 
08:57:39.910 --> 08:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
like i have a concern maybe you're like
 
08:57:39.920 --> 08:57:40.628 align:start position:0%
like i have a concern maybe you're like
me

08:57:40.628 --> 08:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
me
 
08:57:42.468 --> 08:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
or maybe you like the certificate but
 
08:57:44.308 --> 08:57:44.318 align:start position:0%
you don't like the planning
 
08:57:46.708 --> 08:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do
 
08:57:48.548 --> 08:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
take it or leave it
 
08:57:51.670 --> 08:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i object to the way the bill is
 
08:57:54.230 --> 08:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
submitted to this this committee and i
 
08:57:55.830 --> 08:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
think it should be split into three
 
08:57:55.840 --> 08:57:56.868 align:start position:0%
think it should be split into three
bills

08:57:56.868 --> 08:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
bills
 
08:57:58.868 --> 08:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
and if there was a way to do it
 
08:58:01.270 --> 08:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's a way to do
 
08:58:01.280 --> 08:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's a way to do
it

08:58:02.150 --> 08:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:58:06.230 --> 08:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
but uh i really uh i'm offended
 
08:58:08.388 --> 08:58:08.398 align:start position:0%
that at this stage of the game we're
 
08:58:10.708 --> 08:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
playing games like this
 
08:58:13.510 --> 08:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i blame my own leadership
 
08:58:15.910 --> 08:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't have a problem going on
 
08:58:15.920 --> 08:58:16.948 align:start position:0%
and i don't have a problem going on
record

08:58:16.948 --> 08:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
record
 
08:58:20.150 --> 08:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
that i blame my own leadership for
 
08:58:22.708 --> 08:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
submitting a bill like this with three
 
08:58:22.718 --> 08:58:23.910 align:start position:0%
submitting a bill like this with three
separate

08:58:23.910 --> 08:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
separate
 
08:58:23.920 --> 08:58:25.030 align:start position:0%
separate
issues

08:58:25.030 --> 08:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
08:58:26.388 --> 08:58:26.398 align:start position:0%
in one bill
 
08:58:26.398 --> 08:58:27.590 align:start position:0%
in one bill
and

08:58:27.590 --> 08:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:58:29.910 --> 08:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say and
 
08:58:31.750 --> 08:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
i certainly take questions but i don't
 
08:58:34.468 --> 08:58:34.478 align:start position:0%
know how it's either a yes or no
 
08:58:36.548 --> 08:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
take it or leave it so appreciate the
 
08:58:38.468 --> 08:58:38.478 align:start position:0%
time and thank you for saving me till
 
08:58:39.430 --> 08:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
the end
 
08:58:42.070 --> 08:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i hope uh i didn't keep anybody too
 
08:58:45.910 --> 08:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
long thank you joe thank you mr chairman
 
08:58:48.788 --> 08:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
okay we're at the point uh
 
08:58:51.510 --> 08:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
oh we have a question yes
 
08:58:54.308 --> 08:58:54.318 align:start position:0%
this is a question of the chair mr chair
 
08:58:57.190 --> 08:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that um
 
08:58:59.110 --> 08:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee member
 
08:59:02.150 --> 08:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
statements of supporter opposition to
 
08:59:05.350 --> 08:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
bills are for the executive session when
 
08:59:07.350 --> 08:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
we vote on the bills and not as
 
08:59:10.628 --> 08:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
testimony my understanding is that
 
08:59:12.708 --> 08:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
committee members participating in the
 
08:59:15.430 --> 08:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
hearing do not testify
 
08:59:17.030 --> 08:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that that is for the executive
 
08:59:17.040 --> 08:59:18.230 align:start position:0%
and that that is for the executive
session

08:59:18.230 --> 08:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
session
 
08:59:18.240 --> 08:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
session
uh

08:59:19.270 --> 08:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:59:20.948 --> 08:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the comment
 
08:59:23.750 --> 08:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
i got some clarification on that and uh
 
08:59:26.070 --> 08:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
the clarification i got was that
 
08:59:27.590 --> 08:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you were a
 
08:59:29.910 --> 08:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of a bill
 
08:59:32.388 --> 08:59:32.398 align:start position:0%
you we're not we're not allowed to
 
08:59:35.510 --> 08:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh testify on that and you had to
 
08:59:39.110 --> 08:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh we have had people step down
 
08:59:39.120 --> 08:59:40.070 align:start position:0%
actually uh we have had people step down
from

08:59:40.070 --> 08:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
08:59:41.750 --> 08:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
being at the desk here and sitting in
 
08:59:42.948 --> 08:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
08:59:45.110 --> 08:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
during that time period
 
08:59:47.030 --> 08:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that that's
 
08:59:52.070 --> 08:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:59:55.670 --> 08:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:06.548 --> 09:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:08.388 --> 09:00:08.398 align:start position:0%
please there's no need to apologize for
 
09:00:12.548 --> 09:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie but thank you
 
09:00:14.308 --> 09:00:14.318 align:start position:0%
okay we're at the point where i told you
 
09:00:15.830 --> 09:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
we'd be at if
 
09:00:19.430 --> 09:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
we get mr frost to come back to the
 
09:00:19.440 --> 09:00:23.430 align:start position:0%
we get mr frost to come back to the
microphone

09:00:23.430 --> 09:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:25.990 --> 09:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it to the
 
09:00:26.000 --> 09:00:27.110 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it to the
committee

09:00:27.110 --> 09:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
09:00:28.468 --> 09:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
to prompt
 
09:00:30.548 --> 09:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
mr frost with questions that you have
 
09:00:30.558 --> 09:00:32.230 align:start position:0%
mr frost with questions that you have
that

09:00:32.230 --> 09:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
09:00:34.150 --> 09:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
can help
 
09:00:36.628 --> 09:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
get a better understanding of how this
 
09:00:39.830 --> 09:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill came together and what it's uh what
 
09:00:42.708 --> 09:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
it's proposed to accomplish
 
09:00:44.548 --> 09:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
and then when we're done
 
09:00:48.230 --> 09:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:51.670 --> 09:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
so so you stand between dinner
 
09:00:51.680 --> 09:00:58.948 align:start position:0%
so so you stand between dinner
and

09:00:58.948 --> 09:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
09:01:01.030 --> 09:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman i am still

do you want me just to take questions
 
09:01:09.750 --> 09:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah let's start with that and it'll
 
09:01:12.388 --> 09:01:12.398 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll germinate into uh something
 
09:01:16.230 --> 09:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:01:17.910 --> 09:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
09:01:20.468 --> 09:01:20.478 align:start position:0%

09:01:23.350 --> 09:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
actually not mr frost that's between us
 
09:01:25.270 --> 09:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
and dinner it's all of us who are

thank you
 
09:01:33.030 --> 09:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
just a reminder good comment yeah
 
09:01:35.190 --> 09:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
09:01:37.190 --> 09:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you sir for
 
09:01:38.788 --> 09:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
09:01:41.350 --> 09:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
09:01:43.750 --> 09:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
pertains to page four
 
09:01:45.830 --> 09:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
section 10
 
09:01:47.910 --> 09:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
that discusses
 
09:01:51.670 --> 09:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
in statute the ordering or of the
 
09:01:53.830 --> 09:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
schedule of both the
 
09:01:56.948 --> 09:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
superior and supreme courts
 
09:01:56.958 --> 09:01:58.388 align:start position:0%
superior and supreme courts
and

09:01:58.388 --> 09:01:58.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
09:02:01.590 --> 09:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
to put it simply it allows appeals to
 
09:02:04.308 --> 09:02:04.318 align:start position:0%
cut in line
 
09:02:07.030 --> 09:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm troubled by that and also i would
 
09:02:09.430 --> 09:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
like to know if there are other examples
 
09:02:12.868 --> 09:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
in statute where such a provision is is
 
09:02:14.548 --> 09:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
allowed for
 
09:02:16.548 --> 09:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
09:02:18.948 --> 09:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
and representative power i i would
 
09:02:21.030 --> 09:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
start by pointing out that
 
09:02:21.040 --> 09:02:22.150 align:start position:0%
start by pointing out that
um

09:02:22.150 --> 09:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:02:25.030 --> 09:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
the priority
 
09:02:27.110 --> 09:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the court's dockets for land use
 
09:02:29.750 --> 09:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
decisions is existing law
 
09:02:32.388 --> 09:02:32.398 align:start position:0%
this simply modifies the existing law
 
09:02:34.388 --> 09:02:34.398 align:start position:0%
so it's called it's called the rocket
 
09:02:34.398 --> 09:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
so it's called it's called the rocket
docket

09:02:35.990 --> 09:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
docket
 
09:02:37.590 --> 09:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
and if you look at
 
09:02:39.590 --> 09:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
and you see the language here
 
09:02:42.388 --> 09:02:42.398 align:start position:0%
on line 15 of page four that's the
 
09:02:44.468 --> 09:02:44.478 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
09:02:46.788 --> 09:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
so there already is priority in the
 
09:02:49.510 --> 09:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
courts docket for in this case
 
09:02:51.590 --> 09:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh planning board decisions
 
09:02:54.468 --> 09:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
and if you look down same page section
 
09:02:54.478 --> 09:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
and if you look down same page section
11

09:02:55.670 --> 09:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
11
 
09:02:59.670 --> 09:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
um rsa 677.5 priority that's for zba
 
09:03:02.548 --> 09:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
decisions and the the existing law has
 
09:03:04.070 --> 09:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
simply been removed there and the entire
 
09:03:05.990 --> 09:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
section has been replaced so both
 
09:03:08.150 --> 09:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
planning board and zba decisions on
 
09:03:10.230 --> 09:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
appeal to superior court have priority
 
09:03:12.308 --> 09:03:12.318 align:start position:0%
in the courts docket and what we're
 
09:03:15.030 --> 09:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
seeking to do here is to spell out what
 
09:03:17.430 --> 09:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
that means so the court has some
 
09:03:19.750 --> 09:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
instructions from the legislature on how
 
09:03:23.190 --> 09:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
to prioritize those things
 
09:03:25.030 --> 09:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
and this language
 
09:03:29.590 --> 09:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
that is here both in section
 
09:03:32.548 --> 09:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
10 and section 11
 
09:03:34.948 --> 09:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
is actually language that the judicial
 
09:03:37.750 --> 09:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
branch drafted
 
09:03:37.760 --> 09:03:38.628 align:start position:0%
branch drafted
so

09:03:38.628 --> 09:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:03:41.590 --> 09:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
and this was an amendment to the bill as
 
09:03:44.230 --> 09:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate
 
09:03:46.308 --> 09:03:46.318 align:start position:0%
attorney richard head appeared before
 
09:03:47.910 --> 09:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the the senate committee i think it was
 
09:03:47.920 --> 09:03:48.788 align:start position:0%
the the senate committee i think it was
the

09:03:48.788 --> 09:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
09:03:50.070 --> 09:03:50.080 align:start position:0%

committee that was hearing the bill and
 
09:03:54.468 --> 09:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
said that the judicial branch had a
 
09:03:56.388 --> 09:03:56.398 align:start position:0%
problem with the way the bill
 
09:03:58.628 --> 09:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
was written as introduced he came up
 
09:04:01.270 --> 09:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
with language negotiated with
 
09:04:03.990 --> 09:04:04.000 align:start position:0%

uh talked with us about it and this this
 
09:04:10.308 --> 09:04:10.318 align:start position:0%
is what they came up with and we are
 
09:04:12.150 --> 09:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine living with this language
 
09:04:14.708 --> 09:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch came up with
 
09:04:15.910 --> 09:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
